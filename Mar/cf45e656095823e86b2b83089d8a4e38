• As APC Defectors Realign
It’s no longer news how Senator Douye Diri emerged as governor of Bayelsa State; what counts is how he brings the disparate interests together, for the realisation of his vision and mission for the state.
 
On that score, he stressed the importance of a “New Bayelsa of our dream,” during his inauguration and swearing in. The governor said: “We bring the message of hope to Bayelsa State; we bring the message of prosperity to Bayelsa State.”
 
Now, one may ask: What is Diri’s version of the “Bayelsa dreams”? Some of it is captured in his campaign promises to the people of the state.
 
His major priority should be to make Bayelsa the pride of the Niger Delta, a top destination for private investment, a major tourist hub, and most importantly, a state where honest, hard-working men and women are able to find prosperity and good reward for their labour.
