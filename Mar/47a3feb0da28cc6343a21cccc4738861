Flustered by the explosion that ravaged some locations across Lagos recently, the Nigerian Institution of Estate Surveyors and Valuers (NIESV), has announced plans to carry out a technical study of pipeline areas in the state, through its Research and Development Sub-committee. Subsequently, the report from the findings would be presented to the government, to aid a holistic solution to the problem. The Chairman, Lagos branch NIESV, Adedotun Bamigbola disclosed this when the institution in company of the Senior Special Assistant on Housing to the State Governor, Abdul-Hakeem Ayodeji Amodu, and other executive committee members visited the State’s’ Commissioner for Environment, Mr. Tunji Bello. He urged the ministry to support efforts being made to actualise the mission, stressing that their assistance would be required. Bamigbola commiserated with the State government and the affected families on the recent explosion at Abule Ado where many lives were lost and properties destroyed. He lamented that the disaster was an avoidable incident, if laid down regulations were strictly adhere to. The Chairman said the branch is ready to partner with the ministry in anticipation of the 240 day rainfall predicted by the Nigerian Metrological Agency by reaching out to property owners and occupiers through its over 6,000 members across all cadres of the Institution. Receiving the team on behalf of the Commissioner, the Permanent Secretary Environmental Services, Mrs. Belinda Odeneye and her counterpart in charge of Drainage Service and Water Resources, Mr. Nurudeen Sodeinde lauded the team for the visit, especially for their proactive initiative. She stated that government would always need support from  professionals. On his part, Sodeinde highlighted that most of the problems encountered by the ministry in flood management emanate from people’s lukewarm attitude to laws guiding human existence and the use of the environment. Sodeinde advised that a proposal and report for the collaboration on the awareness campaign in the environmental management solutions for the predicted heavy down pour, will be expected from the branch to solve the challenges headlong. He further assured them that the Ministry was ready to partner with the estate surveyors and valuers and proffer solutions to raging problems.
