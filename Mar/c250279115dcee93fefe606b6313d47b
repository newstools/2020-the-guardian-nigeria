The Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), last week, suffered the biggest weekly losses since April 2019, following massive selloffs and exit of investors, due to regulatory risks in the banking sector, a slump in oil prices, and increasing spread of coronavirus.
 
Consequently, the gains accumulated at the beginning of the year were wiped out, as market year-to-date performance turned negative, resulting in a whopping 4.28 per cent loss last week.
 
Specifically, the NSE All-Share Index and market capitalisation both lost 4.28 per cent to close the week at 26,216.46 and N13.658 trillion, respectively. All other indices finished lower with the exception of the NSE Industrial Goods index, which gained 1.08 per cent, while the NSE ASeM Index closed flat.
 
There were also negative reactions to the 2019 unaudited full-year results, such that despite the high pay-out from these companies, share prices continued southward during the week.
 
Analysts have argued that continued illiquidity and low buying interests in the market are also contributory factors to the persistent lull, despite the compelling value and high yields on offer.  Furthermore, 6,321 units of Federal Government Bonds valued at N7.194million were traded last week in 28 deals, compared with a total of 40,469 units valued at N47.681million transacted during the preceding week 25 deals.
  
About six equities appreciated at price during the week, lower than 24 in the previous week. Also 58 equities depreciated, higher than 28 in the previous week, while 99 stocks remained unchanged, lower than 111 recorded in the preceding week.
