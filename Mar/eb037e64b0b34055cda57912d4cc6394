At 83, Baba Obasanjo is still fit and trim, showing no traces of receding physical vitality that signals advancing age. And being fit as a fiddle, the former Nigeria’s President still invests his energy in the service of God, humanity and nation building.
  
Whether as General Olusegun Obasanjo of the Operation Feed the Nation era, or as Matthew Okikiola Aremu Obasanjo of the anti-apartheid age, or as Presidential letter writer, or even President Obasanjo of the garrison political epoch, we see Obasanjo making his mark a variety of ways in a country where he has been destined to be both the father-figure and godfather. As Baba Iyabo dances his way to his nineties and beyond, at each period, it is easy to look at the footprints he is leaving in the sand of time. Those who see Chief Obasanjo as representing the moral compass of the nation may not be mistaken, especially when viewed against the background of his many interventions during disquieting moments of Nigeria’s socio-political progression.  At the end of the day, having burrowed into many books, Obasanjo became a reader moved to emulation, as he authored books about his life story, experience and outlook on life. And so, from My Command, through Not My Will, This Animal Called Man and the multi-volume My Watch, Baba Obasanjo showed not only the workings of his mind, but also his desire to impart knowledge.  
  
From his lowly background, General Obasanjo has been able to demonstrate in words and gestures, even by his achievements that education remains the key to development as well as a powerful social crane to lift man out of the morass of ignorance and poverty.
 
His military background must have equipped him with the confidence and courage to face the challenges of the society. That could be why most often than not those who tried to put Obasanjo down or use his lowly background against him received severe verbal punches in return.
