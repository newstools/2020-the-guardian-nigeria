Kano State Government on Monday alleged that some Federal agencies and airline operators at Mallam Aminu Kano International Airport, (MAKIA), have refused to comply with standard screening procedure to curtail the spread of COVID-19. Kano state Commissioner for health, Dr. Aminu Ibrahim Tsanyawa told a press conference on Monday that the state government has provided adequate logistics to prepare against COVID-19. Tsanyawa, who declined to disclose the identity of the airliners, said the operators have refused to subject their passengers to screening and filling of incident forms where passengers declare their state of health. The commissioner noted that the ministry is working with Federal agencies on health, including Port Health Authority and National Center for Disease Control (NCDC) to man all entry points to forestall the outbreak in Kano. He disclosed that since the confirmation of the outbreak of coronavirus in Lagos, Kano State has activated its emergency preparedness and response committee meeting and incident action plan. “We activated our rapid response team and isolation centre at Yar-gaya.
