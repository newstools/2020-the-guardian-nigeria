NAN correspondents, who visited major markets in the metropolis observed that while the hardware sections of  the markets were shut down to curb the spread of the COVID-19, food markets were, however, exempted from the closure. Lagos State government had directed the closure of markets in the state to check the spread of the COVID-19. In most of the food markets, pest control officers from the Lagos State Ministry of Agriculture were seen fumigating the environments. One of the officials told NAN that the fumigation was one of the measures being taken by the state government to check outbreak of diseases including COVID-19. “The chemicals are friendly to humans and food items but deadly to pests of any kind like rats including bacteria and viruses. “The fumigation is going on simultaneously in all markets in the state,’’ the official, who chose to remain anonymous, said.
At the perishable food section of the Mile 12 Market, market officials had acquired testing thermometers to check the temperature of traders and buyers before allowing them into the market, with the provision of hand sanitisers to sanitise their hands. Mr Femi Odusanya, the vegetable consultant to the Mile 12 Market Perishable Food Association, said that the market officials were putting everything in place to check the COVID-19 breaking out in the market. “The state government in its wisdom decided to exclude the market from total shut down, which is commendable. “We are taking measures to ensure that no case of COVID-19 comes from here. “The pest control has just finished fumigating the market and this will continue for some time. “We have temperature testing equipment which everybody coming in must be subjected to, there is sanitisers, soap and water too for people to wash their hands. “We are also educating traders and our customers on how to avoid contacting and spreading the virus by adopting basic hygiene. “We are encouraging traders and buyers to wear face masks and hand gloves,’’ he said. Odusanya said that all the measures being put in place would be sustained until the fight against coronavirus pandemic was won.
Some of the buyers said that they bought the masks and hand gloves because it would help to prevent contacting and spreading of the COVID-19. At the Jakande Fruit Market Ketu and Ikosi/Isheri Local Council Development Area (LCDA), the traders observed the normal Thursday market sanitation and welcomed the fumigation of the markets. One of the market officials said that they were taking the precautions to prevent outbreak of the COVID-19. He said that the food area would be opened but the hardware sections such as building materials and tyre sections, among others were closed in compliance with government’s directives. NAN, however, observed that the social distancing required to still curb COVID-19 spread was still lacking in the markets and among people in the state.
