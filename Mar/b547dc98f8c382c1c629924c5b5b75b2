  There are indicators that the embattled national chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) may not regain his exalted seat any time soon, especially given his last-minute attempts to impose his lackeys on the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party. Signs of the slim of chances of Oshiomhole’s return emerged yesterday, when the party’s Acting National Secretary, Chief Victor Giadom, announced that the emergency National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting slated for March 17, 2020, would hold.
  
Giadom stressed the fact that since Oshiomhole made the pronouncement announcing the inclusion of former Oyo State governor, Senator Abiola Ajimobi and Mr. Waziri Bulama as Deputy National Chairman (South) and National Secretary respectively shortly after the court ruling on his suspension, he remains the highest-ranking official of the party constitutionally empowered not only to convene the party’s NEC but also the convention.
