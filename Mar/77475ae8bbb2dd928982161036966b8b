Australian Thief With Fishing Rod | Image: Twitter/VictoriaPolice Australian police are looking for an unconventional thief who burgled a store in Melbourne, Australia, using a fishing rod. The thief was caught on camera hooking a gold necklace with a fishing rod in a brazen nighttime theft from an Australian designer store. In the CCTV footage released publicly by the police, he broke the store window in Melbourne’s central business district before using a fishing rod to hook the Versace necklace, local police said Wednesday. The burglary happened just after 2 a.m. on February 24. Police believe it took the man three hours to steal the necklace from the store. After first attempts with a smaller rod failed, the man decided to get a bigger rod, eventually snagging the gold $700 (₦255,850) piece from a mannequin’s neck in a crime police described as “unseen” until now.

The store owner, Steven Adigrati was struck by the ingenuity of the thief. Speaking with Nine News, he said: “I couldn’t believe it. Three and a half hours, with two rods, trying to get this necklace, was amazing. Hook, line, and sinker, I guess. He did it.”
