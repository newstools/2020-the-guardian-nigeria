Grace Fusco died after being infected with Covid-19 at a hospital in New Jersey, where she had been attached to a ventilator. She was a mother of 11 and a grandmother of 27. When the 73-year-old died, she was not aware that her son Carmine Fusco, 55, had died from the disease earlier the same day. Also, her daughter Rita Fusco-Jackson, 55, died after contracting the coronavirus on Friday. Four other members of the family are still being treated for the condition in CentraState Medical Center in New Jersey, with three of them in intensive care. Another 20 family members are quarantined in their homes. The family’s lawyer, Roseann Paradiso Fodera confirmed that none of the three victims had underlying health problems. Speaking about how the family contacted the virus, they have been exposed to the virus at a family dinner attended by a person who’d been in contact with the first person to die from COVID-19 in the state. Fusco-Jackson’s sister, Elizabeth Fusco said; This has been devastating for all of us. Our hearts are broken over losing our sister, Rita. We just need help in saving our family members with life-saving medication. Since the breakout, there have been many deaths, however, some people recovered.
