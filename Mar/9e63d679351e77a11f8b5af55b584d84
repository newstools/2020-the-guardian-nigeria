Coalition for Transparency and Democratic Leadership has called on the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to probe the alleged $30million used by the All Progressive Congress (APC) during the 2019 Bayelsa gubernatorial election. The executive director of the coalition, Kingsley Eluma, who addressed journalists in Abuja during a protest, said the group was protesting to inform the EFCC about infractions and violation of extant laws by a former governor of Bayelsa, Timipre Sylva, APC gubernatorial candidate, David Lyon, Chief Emeka Offor and certain multinational oil majors operating in Bayelsa state. Eluma alleged that the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) awarded contracts to private companies of Timipre Sylva for the purpose of funding the election without following the procurement laws. “Our private investigation also shows that the Management of the Niger Delta Development Commission gave the sum of Five Million Dollars ($5 million) to the All Progressive Congress, Bayelsa State through Chief Timipre Sylva apart from the contract awarded to his companies without following due process,” Eluma said. “Chief Timipre Sylva also compromised his position and office by using his privileged position to mandate all oil majors to donate certain sums of money which totalled Twenty Million Dollars ($20 million) an act that grossly violates extant laws.” Eluma asked the EFCC to look into the “allegations and bring offenders to justice as you have always done even in the investigation and prosecution of Arms funds for campaign in the same November l6th gubernatorial election in Bayelsa State.” He said the alleged offences committed by the APC, Sylva, Lyon and the NDDC has had a “huge effect on the economy of the state and nation.” “If such grievous offences are allowed to go without necessary punitive measure, it has potential and capacity to embolden other persons to commit same,” Eluma said.
