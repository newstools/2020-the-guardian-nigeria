The Nigerian society once upon a time had personalities that were distinguished both in conducts and character to become role models of their time. The youth and protégés of those days have grown in age and status. But the same cannot be said of those sterling qualities that endeared mentees to idols of old. Hence the inquiry: where are the role models in today’s Nigeria and what has happened to them? Indeed, every civilisation has its torchbearers and role models. They are all-round achievers in their own right, with exceptional positive qualities that are worth emulating. More often, they are revolutionaries whose narrow paths in the thick forests of life have become superhighways used by all today. They show us what is possible in life, through the harmony of thoughts, actions, values, and behaviours. The best life lessons often come from these forerunners – our role models. 
 
These exemplars cut across all ages and races, and both African culture and our ancient civilisation are not an exemption. We cannot in a hurry forget the exploits of the likes of King Jaja of Opobo, Efunsetan Aniwura of Egba, Queen Amina Bakwa of Zaria, Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti and Margaret Ekpo, to mention a few. Most important, traditional moral values and complementary conducts exemplify the role models, not the wealth or offices that they occupied. It is the aggregation of these two – that is, character and conduct, morality and intellect – that still stand out the African culture and Africans in the global community.
