A cross section of worshippers during the Jumaat service in Kaduna… yesterday Despite the restriction on religious services and all large gatherings by the Kaduna State Government, Muslims, yesterday, observed Jumaat service in the state. The State Government, few hours to Jumaat prayer, had issued a statement advising Imams not hold Juma’at service, but The Guardian observe that worshippers filled popular Jumaat Mosques such as Sultan Bello, Bida Road and Sheikh Gumi Market Mosques. The worshippers said the notice issued by the State Government was coming at a short period, as they had already prepared for Jumaat congregation. However, some Imams at the Mosques announced the suspension of religious activities in the state, including Quranic classes until further notice. Mallam Kassim, a worshipper at Sultan Bello Mosque, along Kawo also told The Guardian that Imam of the Mosque, Dr Muhammad Sulieman announced the closure of the mosque shortly after the Friday prayer indefinitely amidst the fear of coronavirus. In a statement by Muyiwa Adekeye, Special Adviser to the Governor on Media & Communication, while no case of Covid-19 has been reported in the state so far, the government is duty bound to work with all leaders and residents of the state to jointly ensure that everything is done to reduce the chance of the disease taking root and spreading in the state. “Imams are advised not to hold Juma’at services today. In this regard, the government is taking cue from the decision of the government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the cradle of Islam, not to hold such prayers in the two Holy Mosques in Makkah and Madina.
