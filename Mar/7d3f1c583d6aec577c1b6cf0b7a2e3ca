A civil society organisation (CSO), Talakawa’s Parliament, yesterday urged the Edo government to mediate in the communal clash between Amagba and Oke-Oroma communities in Ikpoba Okha council area of the state. Disturbed by the killings in the bloody feud, the group’s Public Relations Officer, Comrade Aigbogun Emmanuel, implored the Governor Godwin Obaseki administration and the state police command to arrest the ugly development. The CSO, however, threatened to embark on a protest in seven days if nothing concrete was done. Meanwhile, the Nigerian Petroleum Development Company (NPDC) at the weekend donated seven 500KVA and 300 KVA step-down transformers to the seven host communities of OML 65 and the Non Oil and Gas Asset (NOGA). The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) subsidiary also gave out 300 solar-powered deep freezers as well as 3,000 school chairs and desks. The firm’s Deputy Manager, Community Relations Department (CRD), Noble Imabibo, who made the presentations on behalf of the Managing Director, Mansur Sambo, said the gesture was to boost the people’s economy and ameliorate their hardship.He clarified that the items were to be shared equitably among the communities. His words: “The items will in no doubt improve the presence of social amenities and lives of the people.“It is therefore pertinent to utilise the kind gesture to better your lives and those of your families. “NPDC is a friend to the communities where it operates. We are partners in progress and we share a common bond towards sustaining the existing mutual relationship. “We shall continue to leverage the peaceful co-existence and improve on our corporate social responsibilities to bring about development in our host communities.” Sambo advised the beneficiaries to eschew violence, radicalism and other actions capable of creating social unrest.
