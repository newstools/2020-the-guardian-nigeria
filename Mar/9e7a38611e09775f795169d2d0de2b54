Nigeria President Muhammadu Buhari on Sunday directed the closure of businesses in the country’s commercial hub Lagos State, Ogun and capital city Abuja. Buhari ordered the closure of the businesses in a national broadcast of his government’s efforts to curb further spread of coronavirus. The President also banned “all movements in Lagos and the FCT for an initial period of 14 days with effect from 11 pm on Monday, 30th March 2020.” The restriction, Buhari said, will also apply to Ogun State due to its close proximity to Lagos and the high traffic between the two States. “All businesses and offices within these locations should be fully closed during this period,” Buhari said. Consequently, Buhari said all citizens in these areas are to stay in their homes, advising that travel to or from other states should be postponed. He, however, exempted businesses providing essential services related to health from the ban. “This order does not apply to hospitals and all related medical establishments as well as organizations in healthcare-related manufacturing and distribution,” Buhari said. He explained that the period of the ban will be used to identify, trace and isolate all individuals that have come into contact with confirmed cases. We will ensure the treatment of confirmed cases while restricting further spread to other States.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
