 Sen.Solomon Adeola  Adeola in a statement on Friday by his Media Adviser, Chief Kayode Odunaro, said the grant was much needed to complement the untiring efforts of Lagos government in containing the pandemic. “I want to specially thank Mr President for the grant of N10 billion to Lagos State for the fight against COVID-19. ” The grant is not only merited on the basis of the pioneering and continuing role of Lagos State in combating the scourge of the deadly virus but in terms of the massive and concentrated population of Lagos State estimated at over 20 million of all tribes in Nigeria” he stated. He called on all constituents and Nigerians to as much as possible adhere to precautionary medical directives from all relevant authorities including social distancing and staying at home for a period to stem the tide of the disease. He said the pandemic has again confirmed the status of Lagos as not only the commercial and economic nerve of Nigeria but the need for a special status and funding for Lagos State in the constitution as the former capital of Nigeria. “It is clear now that Lagos State is special in several respects, we play host to hundreds of thousands of Nigerians from all part of the country and even nationals from many countries. “Many national socio- economic institutions of the nation are still domiciled in Lagos state putting additional burden on infrastructure that the state government must look after in the national interest as it has been shown in the management of this pandemic” he stated.
