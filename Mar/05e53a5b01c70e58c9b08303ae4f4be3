Following the success of the past seasons, PACE Sports and Entertainment Marketing has announced that all is set for a more exciting 2020 Higher Institutions Football League (HiFL) season.
 
Speaking at the international press conference to announce the commencement of the 2020 season, the Director, PACE Sports and Entertainment Marketing, Sola Fijabi, assured that this season promises to be an exciting outing, as the league aims at  enhancing youth development in Nigeria.
 
He said:  “Already, a number of the outstanding talents from both the 2018 and 2019 seasons are on the books of professional football teams in Nigeria with more to follow. We thank Stanbic IBTC, Premier Cool, Bold and Panadol for their support of the initiative, while we look forward to other brands to join us in changing the game.  “There is a new commitment among all parties to ensure a stellar outing in the competition. We are glad that the league has not only given a voice to the abundant football talents across the country, but also an instrument for socio-economic development,” Hamafyelto added.
   
Meanwhile, it is worth noting that the UNICAL Malabites of the University of Calabar are defending champions after hosting the trophy in 2019, following the achievements of the UAM Tillers who lifted the inaugural cup in 2018.
