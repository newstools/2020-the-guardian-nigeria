The Council for Regulation of Engineering in Nigeria (COREN) has granted full accreditation in four engineering programmes being run by the Federal University, Oye Ekiti (FUOYE). The approval was contained in a letter dated March 19, 2020, signed by the Councilâ€™s Registrar, Prof. Joseph Odigure and addressed to the Vice-Chancellor of FUOYE, Prof. Kayode Soremekun. The programmes granted full accreditation include Civil Engineering, Computer Engineering, Mechatronics Engineering and Met/Mat Engineering. The council recently paid an assessment visit to the university in line with the accreditation procedure. The COREN said the full accreditation commenced February 26, 2020. It, however, said it would conduct a post-accreditation visit to the university. While urging FUOYE management to adhere strictly to the recommendations in its report, the council said the approval granted the university would last for five years.
