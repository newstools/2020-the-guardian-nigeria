The commission would compensate the operators, a spokesman said separately, but no details were available. Thailand’s main three mobile operators did not immediately respond to requests for comment. “The government is giving the data so the public can stay home and limit the spread of COVID-19,” Takorn said. Thailand on Tuesday reported 127 new coronavirus cases, bringing the national tally up to 1,651 since the country’s first case was reported in January. There have been 10 deaths. Third-ranked mobile operator, Total Access Communication Pcl (DTAC) said it was considering accelerating investment to expand its mobile data footprint based on new patterns of usage. In the past, data use has usually increased in areas with dense populations, but the current increase is widespread, including residential areas outside city centres, DTAC Head of Investor Relations, Sirawit Klabdee said. “This is a challenge because (when) increasing capacity in areas outside the city … there are uncertainties like the duration of the heightened data use,” he said. The company was considering increasing its annual capital expenditure this year to 15 billion baht (457 million dollars) from 13 billion baht, he said. The government declared a state of emergency last week and urged companies to adopt work from home policies to limit the movement of people. Top mobile operator, Advanced Info Service Pcl has seen mobile data and broadband volume growth of more than  10 per cent in the last month, chief consumer business officer Pratthana Leelapanang, said. Video conferencing grew more than ten times, partly due to the increase in remote learning because of the closure of schools and universities, he said. Rival operator, True Corporation Pcl said last week it would triple its broadband capacity after seeing a 52 per cent increase in broadband use and 18.4 per cent jump in mobile data usage in the last month.
