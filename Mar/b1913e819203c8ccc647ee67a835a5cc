Giwa Businesses at Ilupeju’s CAPPA Mechanic Village, Lagos State, yesterday down tools to mourn a man, Olakunle Giwa, who was on Saturday night murdered in Ogun State. Commercial activities were also suspended at the popular mechanic village, following the gruesome murder of Giwa. The late technician, who owned an auto repair workshop in the mechanic village sited in the industrial avenue axis of Ilupeju, was reportedly killed by a mob of rampaging commercial motorcyclists for ramming into an okada rider with his vehicle at Lafenwa bus stop, Itele in Ogun State. According to Ilupeju Today Newspaper, the angry mob pounced on the deceased and beat him to death at about 10:45p.m. His vehicle was also set ablaze by the distraught motorcyclists. The technician was returning from his Ilupeju workshop and heading towards his residence in Ogun State when the incident occurred. The Ogun State police command said it has commenced investigation into the incident. The lynching occurred few days after a similar mob incident last week Tuesday when a tipper driver allegedly crushed the chairman of a Community Development Association to death at Iyesi area of Ota, Ado-Odo/Ota Local Government Area of Ogun, Chief Edun. Edun was killed while attempting to collect “maintenance fee” from the driver who resisted. The community was fixing a terrible portion of the road at the particular location where the incident happened. According to eyewitnesses, the CDA chairman slipped in the course of the struggle to collect money from the driver and fell down, after which the tipper crushed him to death. Miffed by the fatal fate that befell Edun, angry residents descended on the driver and beat him to a stupour. The mob later went ahead to burn the tipper. The arrival of traffic and security agents to the scene did not dissuade the mob from setting the tipper on fire.
