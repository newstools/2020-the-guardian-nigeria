The Lagos State National Youth Service Corp Coordinator, Mr. Eddy Megwa has cautioned the 2020 Batch A corps members against indiscipline and immoral activities that would lead to their rustication from the orientation camp and the national scheme. He gave the warning while briefing the corp members toady, ahead of the swearing in ceremony, which will take place on Thursday, at the State Orientation Camp at Age, Iyana Ipaja, Lagos. Megwa who commended the corp members on successfully completing their tertiary institution degree, said while some corp members engaged in dubious acts to pass their examinations, the orientation exercise would inculcate them discipline, good character and virtue, among other qualities they would require to excel as better citizens in the society. “It is not our business to question how you got your degree, some of you cheated and bought your degree so that you will pass. “For those of you that engaged in dubious ways to pass, will have to go and sin no more. You did that at the civilian environment. Here in the orientation camp we work precept by precept, it is fully organised and you are expected to take heed to every instructions given at this orientation camp. “You must not insult or molest any camp officials, irrespective of who are in the society, failure will attract rustication. Stealing is an offence in the camp, no amount of begging will permit forgiveness. But if a curse has been laid on you to steal other people’s property, go down on your knees and pray to God for deliverance” he said. Stating the various crimes and punishment, Megwa said: “If you are caught stealing you will be dealt with. You will be on the social media after the disgrace that you would be subjected to. “It is against the rules of the camp that alcohol be sold, but perhaps the sellers smuggles it in and you are caught buying it, you would be decamped. Do not misbehave in the camp. “Do not take hard drugs in the camp, we have officers from the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) here and others unknown. If you smuggle drugs here in camp we are watching you. I am begging you as your father to drop such bad act. Once you are caught, you will go through the rigours of arrest and imprisonment before you are sent home.” He urged the corp members to obey the rules of the orientation camp, as well as the officials, noting that the watch word of the NYSC  is discipline. Stating the benefits of the NYSC Service scheme, Megwa said it seeks to foster unison, peace, promote culture and tradition of the various tribes in Nigeria, and ensure that  the corp members acclamatise with the regions in the country. He also stated that the health of the corp members is of utmost priority to the NYSC, as protective and prevent measures are put together to ensure no incident of coronavirus is recorded among the corp members during their stay at the orientation camp. He, however, promised the corp members of a memorable stay in the orientation camp as they would be engaged in social activities, skill and talent development, among others, while he noted that the Lagos State government is working to ensure that the state NYSC Secretariat is moved to a bigger site for better convinence.
