He said: “I’m a carpenter but people know me in my area as a military man. I love the profession. Since 2007, I have been applying to the Nigerian Army, but I didn’t make it. For one reason or the others, they would disqualify me. Because I love the job, I got army uniform. I traveled around with the uniform. People gave me money because they knew me as a soldier. But this is the first time I would involve in rape. I wooed the girl and took her to my friend’s house”.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
