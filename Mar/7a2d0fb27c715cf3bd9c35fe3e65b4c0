The Lagos State House of Assembly yesterday called on the governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, to set up fire service stations in all the 57 council areas in the state as part of measures to prevent more fire disaster in the state. The House also resolved that the governor should direct the Commissioner for Special Duties, Seye Oladejo, on the need for all public and private institutions to have functioning fire extinguishers in their domains. Hon. Akeem Shokunke (Oshodi-Isolo I) who moved the motion on behalf of others during plenary, said incidents of fire disaster were too frequent in the state, adding that there was need for drastic measures for it to be curtailed. He said: “There has been incidents of fire disaster in the state. The government has expended huge amount of money on every occurrence. The House therefore calls on the governor to direct the ministry of Special Duties to carry out sensitization on danger inherent by failure to have fire extinguishers in schools, markets and others,” Shokunle said. Hon. Tobun said “fire usually starts on a light mode but escalates if not contained. If government compels every household to have fire extinguishers, we can easily minimize the incident of fire disaster.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
