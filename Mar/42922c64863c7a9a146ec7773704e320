Brow Skin Like Eva’” First introduced to the masses in a 30sec social media preview which quickly accumulated millions of views ‘Gangsta’ quickly became a cultural moment – charting in The Official Chart’s Top 40 in its 1st week of release and eventually reaching #22. ‘Gangsta’ is now certified silver in the UK with over 200,000 sales and has surpassed 13Million combined views on YouTube.
