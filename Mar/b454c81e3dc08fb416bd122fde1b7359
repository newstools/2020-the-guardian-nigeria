Analysts predict slowdown on the losing momentum as low prices of stocks, and high dividend yields attract buying interest that cannot be resisted by smart money. Specifically, the Chief Research Officer of Investdata Consulting Limited, Ambrose Omordion said: “as more audited corporate earnings hit the market, going forward. This is despite the likely continuation of the mixed intraday movement in the midst of selloffs. “The impact of the virus seems heavy, killing more stock markets and economy than people across the globe, sending panic waves around the world, more devastating than the financial meltdown of 2008. “Nigerian stocks hit new lows as the NSE’s benchmark index hit a new 11-year low on a huge traded volume that suggests that investors are dumping their shares, in their frenzied bid to cut their losses. “Investors are expected to increase positions in undervalued stocks ahead of dividend declaration, also against the backdrop of the fact that the capital wave in the financial market may persist in the midst of relatively low-interest rates in the money market.” Analyst at Codros Capital Limited said: “Looking ahead, we still see sizeable legroom for further downslide in risk assets as investors continue to run towards safety in the face of the precipitous decline in oil price.” A breakdown of transactions last week’s trading showed that the equities market recorded the highest decline since September 12, 2019, amid fears of persistent decline in global oil prices and rising cases of COVID-19, causing market capitalisation to crash further by N329billion.
