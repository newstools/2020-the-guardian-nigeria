However, this held days after two cases of coronavirus in Nigeria were announced. After weeks of speculations, it has been revealed by the Honourable Commissioner for Health of Lagos State, Professor Akin Abayomi that all participants that attended the event may have come in contact with one of the confirmed cases in Lagos and most likely been exposed to the coronavirus. Nigerians react to this news on twitter. Find the reactions below: Only gone out to get fuel and food since I found out about AMVCA. Because I really have no choice in that matter. — Chidi Okereke (@Chydee) March 24, 2020  Take a Moment and crunch the numbers. The AMVCA was 10 days ago,
TEN DAYS AGO!!!

That should have been enough reason to postpone the event! — M. O. Bamidele (@Femi_Uncensored) March 24, 2020  This is not even the case of just AMVCA.
There was an after party and I can bet most of the celebrities entered clubs that same night! In fact everyone at Eko hotel that night were exposed.#COVID19NIGERIA #AMVCA2020 — Adekemi (@VioletofLagos) March 24, 2020  They should just forget about contact tracing in lagos. If this Amvca gist is true because it is game over niyen. Just lock down the state and test every body — Anikky Baby! (@cuddlesfash) March 24, 2020  After AMVCA there was after party, most of the attendees went clubbing, so many contacts, how many people will be honest enough to come forward? — FOWO$£RE (@espeezeal) March 24, 2020
