As part of efforts to deepen opportunities and encourage farmers, the Lagos State government has reiterated its commitment to optimally harness its comparative and competitive advantage in agriculture to grow the state’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu stated this at the launch of the maiden edition of the Eko-City Farmers’ Market held recently, noting that agriculture remained one of the main sectors through which his administration planned to achieve the objective of making Lagos a 21st century economy. Represented by his deputy, Dr. Kadiri Hamzat, the governor noted that the initiative was conceived to offer greater market access to farmers and agribusiness men and women, insisting that the initiative will encourage more farmers and other new entrants into the sector thus creating more jobs and opportunity for Lagosians. He described the Eko-City Farmers’ Market as an exceptional initiative aimed at providing a conducive, safe and well-structured environment where farmers can trade their farm produce directly to consumers at farm gate prices. The governor explained that the initiative was designed as a monthly market to be hosted on the last Sunday of every month in order to consistently create an inclusive platform that would cater to the diverse needs of people in different social strata as well as ensure food safety and traceability that meets with international market standards. Speaking earlier, the Commissioner for Agriculture, Gbolahan Lawal, stated that the idea of the Eko City Farmers’ Market has its genesis from the outcome of the stakeholders’ summit the ministry held on September 11, 2019 wherein the issue of agricultural produce market and facilitating market linkage for farmers featured prominently in the discussion and subsequently the communiqué that emanated from the summit.
