Joyner Lucas – Will In anticipation of his upcoming long-awaited debut album, ADHD, American rapper Joyner Lucas has released the music video to “Will”, a song which is a homage to actor Will Smith.

Will Smith responded via a video published on his Instagram story that he is humbled and honoured: “Joyner Lucas. That joint is crazy. Dude, I am humbled and honoured. One of the lines you’re saying in there, ‘You inspire people and you don’t even know it.’ It has been my intention from day one to really go into the world and just put positive energy and to be able to use my creation to inspire and elevate and empower. I just love what you’ve done, it’s creative. Brother again, humbled and hope to meet you one day.” Will Smith responds to Joyner Lucas video.
