• Apex Bank’s COVID-19 Intervention Hits N3.5tr Having technically devalued the Naira, the bankers’ committee, yesterday, prioritised access to foreign exchange, asking firms to import only what they need and focus on sourcing raw materials and inputs locally.
  
Specifically, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) asked oil firms to sell their foreign exchange to the bank and no longer the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), as part of measures to improve forex supply, while identified local pharmaceutical companies will be granted naira and foreign exchange funding facilities to support procurement of raw materials and equipment required to increase local drug production.  The regulator has moved the official rate to N360 to the dollar from N307 per dollar previously, and now selling dollar to foreign portfolio investors (FPI) at N380 at the Investors’ & Exporters Forex window from N366 per dollar previously.
