In their presentation, NSOFT seeks the establishment of a special National Software Strategy as a critical Framework for improving understanding of the challenges and national security risks observed in the software development ecosystem and implications for Nigeria. According to them, “We are here to seek partnership with the office of the honorable Minister on how the software ecosystem can be strategically harnessed and deployed for mass employment of our youth, valuable contributions to the GDP, sustainable development goals, national security and creation of wealth. “Recognizing the enormity of challenges faced by the Nigerian software ecosystem as critical national infrastructure for the economy and security, there is urgent need for legal protection of the Software Industry”. The group however, urged Nigeria Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) and National Office for Technology Acquisition and Promotion (NOTAP) to formulate official memos desirous of Executive Orders on five most appropriate strategies for accelerated implementation. “NITDA and NOTAP should as well facilitate the setting up of a National Software Strategic Plan implementation Task Force with Presidential approval”. The National Software Think Tank is a convergence of ICT expert group setup by  NITDA and the National Office for Technology Acquisition and Promotion (NOTAP) as a significant fallout on the resolution of the 2-day ICT Stakeholders Roundtable on the application and use of Software in the financial sector – jointly hosted in Lagos by NOTAP and the National Information technology Development Agency (NITDA) last year.
