Arsenal Football Club has said none of its staff is infected with the coronavirus after Olympiacos owner Evangelos Marinakis tested positive to the virus. “Our home match with Olympiacos in the Europa League was played on Thursday 27th February and none of our staff who came into contact with him on that matchday have reported any symptoms,” an Arsenal spokesman told Goal. “We continue to follow strict protocols with regard to coronavirus. We’re following the Government health guidelines and have additional procedures in place to protect our players and staff. “This has included regular deep cleaning of areas used by players at Emirates Stadium and our training centre.” Arsenal’s disclosure on their staff status on coronavirus came after Marinakis revealed that he contacted the virus. Marinakis was at Emirates Stadium less than two weeks ago when the Greek club beat the Gunners to qualify for the Europa League last 16 stages. Marinakis was at the ground watching from the directors’ box. After the full-time whistle, he went down into the visitors’ changing room and was also out celebrating with the Olympiacos players on the pitch in front of the away support. The millionaire businessman, who also owns Championship side Nottingham Forest, announced he was suffering from the virus on Tuesday. “The recent virus has ‘visited’ me and I felt obliged to let the public know,” said Marinakis. Marinakis had contact with numerous members of Arsenal’s staff throughout the evening – but the north London club says no-one who he was with has shown any signs that the virus may have been passed on. “I feel good as I take all the necessary measures and I (adhere) to the doctors’ instructions. “I strongly advise all my fellow citizens to do the same. I wish all a quick recovery.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
