MomChitChat hosts, Jayne Augoye, Nicole Chikwe and Modupe Eyinla In the changing and digitalised world, raising children, while running the home and being a business or career woman has its challenges and peculiarities. Hence, a new talk show, MomChitChat hosted by three dynamic mummy influencers is set to ease and inspire mothers and mothers to be. Hosted by Nicole Chikwe, convener The Mummy Summit, Modupe Eyinla Founder Imumzone, and Jayne Augoye founder Fabmumng, the show focuses on a range of topics that mothers can relate to and learn ways to cope through real life experiences. They include picky eating, intimacy in marriage, raising children with special needs, hiring domestic help and managing relationships with in-laws. The talk show highlights the realities of what it really means to raise thriving balanced children while running the home in this digital era. “There is no one-size-fits-all approach when it comes to raising a family, pursuing a career or even running a business in Africa and indeed Nigeria,” the producers noted. This is why MomChitChat was created to be the go-to hub for answers to pressing challenges confronting millennial mothers. We aim to inspire, motivate and encourage mums across the African continent. Anchored in a fun and relatable manner, the show also features insightful interviews with leading experts across different sectors. Some of the guests who have featured on the show include Yeside Agboola of ‘Olori Coitus’, Ola Soetan of ‘Secret Place Husband’ and Nneamaka Mokwe-Ijoko, Ifeyinwa Omiesete of ‘The Kid Nutritionist’, Tonye Ekezie of ‘Simone’s Oasis’ and Dr. Anire Chima-Oduko.
