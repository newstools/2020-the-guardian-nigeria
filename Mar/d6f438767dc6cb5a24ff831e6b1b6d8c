The number of confirmed novel coronavirus cases in the Netherlands passed the 10,000 marks on Sunday, the authorities said, as the country focuses on building up herd immunity rather than confining the population of 17 million. A total of 771 people have died from the COVID-19 epidemic in the Netherlands and 10,866 have tested positive, the country's institute for public health and environment (RIVM) said. The Dutch government has adopted a series of measures to fight the virus but has decided so far not to force people to stay home. A review of the policy is due to be unveiled on Tuesday. "The number of reported hospital admissions and the number of deceased patients appears to be increasing less rapidly than would be expected without measures in place," the institute said on its website. "In a number of days, it can be concluded whether the number of hospital admissions and the number of deaths among reported patients is actually levelling off, and thus how well the measures are working."
