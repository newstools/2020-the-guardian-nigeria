Ogun State Government said it will be distributing hand sanitizers it produced to residents for free to curb the further spread of coronavirus. “The Ogun State Ministry of Health and Hospital Management Board have produced “Not for Sale” hand sanitizers for mass distribution across the State, as part of steps to contain the spread of COVID-19,” Ogun State said in a statement. The government urged the general public to make themselves accessible to the distributing officials while ensuring that they continue to maintain personal hygiene measures and social distancing. “It is essential to emphasise that these sanitizers are NOT FOR SALE, and that they should not be deemed a vaccine or drug but a handwashing facility that should only be used externally,” the government said, “Use of the sanitizers by children should be under adult supervision.” Two of the 40 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Nigeria were recorded in Ogun State. Lagos State has the highest number with 28. Abuja has 7, while Oyo, Ekiti and Ondo have all recorded one case each. Ogun State had already ordered the closure of all schools and banned all social and religious gatherings to prevent the spread of the global pandemic. The state government on Monday asked workers in its civil service to begin working from home until the virus subsides.
