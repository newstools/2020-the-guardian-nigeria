The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ondo State says it is deeply saddened by the grim effect of Saturday’s explosion of a dynamite-laden truck on the Akure-Owo highway. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the explosion had destroyed a church, school and some houses while cutting the highway in two. The party in a statement made available to newsmen on Sunday in Akure by Mr Alex Kalejaiye, the state’s Publicity Secretary, commiserated with the victims of the explosion. “The party’s sympathy goes to the victims of the deadly circumstance, the state government and entire people of the state,” the statement said. It commended the quick response of the government and the security agencies in allaying the fears of residents and for seeking an alternative route to the damaged portion of the ever-busy Akure-Owo road. The party called on companies and individuals to be more circumspect in taking precautions when moving items that were capable of unleashing devastating consequences on people when handled carelessly. It wished that injured speedy recovery, stressing the need for federal authorities to expedite action on the rebuilding of the road as well as lend support to those whose property was destroyed.
