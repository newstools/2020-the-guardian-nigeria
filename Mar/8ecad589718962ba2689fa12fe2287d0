Tanzanian artiste, Harmonize has dropped a new single titled “Mama“. Mama is a melodious tribute to mothers across the globe who look out for their children and keep them in their prayers. This comes at a somewhat perfect time as tomorrow marks “Mother’s Day”, a celebration honoring the mother of the family, as well as motherhood, maternal bonds, and the influence of mothers in society. The new song was taken off his much-anticipated debut Album Project titled “Afro East“. Harmonize has worked with several artistes especially back here in Nigeria; some of them include Skales, Yemi Alade, Seyi Shay, Mr. Eazi, etc. Watch the video below:  Read More: Watch: Skales Features Tanzanian Sensation Harmonize On “Oyoyo” Read More: Harmonize And Mr Eazi Drop New Track “Tepete” Read More: Watch: Harmonize And Yemi Alade Show Dance Moves In “Show Me What You Got” Read More: Listen To Seyi Shay’s ‘Ko Ma Roll’ Featuring Harmonize
