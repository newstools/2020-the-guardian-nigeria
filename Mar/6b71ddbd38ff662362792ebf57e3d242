Real Madrid defender Marcelo has been fined 105,000 euros ($117,000) for driving without a valid licence, the Superior Court of Justice in Madrid announced Thursday. The Brazil international was stopped by police in December after reportedly being clocked driving at 134km/h (83mph) in a 120km/h zone. He was subsequently found to be without a valid licence. It is not the first driving offence for the 31-year-old left-back. He was fined 6,000 euros in March 2013 for driving after his licence had been revoked. Marcelo has made 505 appearances for Madrid since joining the club in 2007.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
