Yesterday while addressing the issue of coronavirus, President Donald Trump referred to it as the Chinese virus. This was termed as racist by many and for this, he has faced so many backlash. “The United States will be powerfully supporting those industries, like Airlines and others, that are particularly affected by the Chinese Virus. We will be stronger than ever before!” Find below some of the reactions below: “Chinese virus.” The guy is willingly putting people at risk for hate crimes. He knows what he’s doing. https://t.co/cVoc7fQjGF — Tamir  (@umoktamir) March 17, 2020  y’all really have a president that refers to c19 as “the Chinese virus” whewwww  pic.twitter.com/ESGfSpxdGZ — positiviᵗᵉᵃ (@TeaSpillYT) March 17, 2020  It’s not the CHINESE VIRUS you racist sack of dogshit; it’s THE TRUMP VIRUS. You were warned about this in 2017. What did you do? Disband the pandemic office in 2018; slash budgets for the CDC, NIH & HHS; turn down COVID-19 tests offered to us IN FEBRUARY.pic.twitter.com/DUR1Jl7CpU — Andrew Wortman (@AmoneyResists) March 17, 2020  That is what it is: Chinese Virus. #Covid19 https://t.co/4vM2JdurU6 — Kanchan Gupta (@KanchanGupta) March 17, 2020  So “Chinese Virus” is racist, but “New Delhi Metallo-beta-lactamase1 (NDM1) Superbug” is not. pic.twitter.com/TbD0gMQ30f — Anand Ranganathan (@ARanganathan72) March 17, 2020  Calling it a “Chinese Virus” makes me incredibly sad. I’m a proud American (happen to be born in China), who is an American thru & thru. This global  virus knows no race, no creed, or ethnic origin. Let’s conquer #COVID19 together, not apart. https://t.co/Pzpvy3PAiD — Eric Feigl-Ding (@DrEricDing) March 17, 2020  THE CHINESE VIRUS

Williams (@w_terrence) March 17, 2020  As a last birthday present to me can we all agree to never call it the “Chinese Virus” ever again? — Chris Ballinger (@ballingerfamily) March 17, 2020  Global pandemics are usually named after the place, city or country it originated.. so the notion that Pres. Trump is ‘racist’ becoz he is calling it the Chinese virus is another example of the primitive nature of the minds of pple who subscribe to the SJW far left dogma pic.twitter.com/5lJxDQFHr0 — Melissa A. (@TheRightMelissa) March 17, 2020  weird. I thought being called Chinese Virus was a special thing just my ex called me. sad and scared. https://t.co/B4pqYXm4J0 — natalie tran (@natalietran) March 17, 2020  two weeks ago trump was calling coronavirus a “democrat hoax” and now hes calling it “the chinese virus”??? what happened? did jared try to sell it visas for $150 mil? did it give ivanka trademarks? did it start sewing maga hats? — m i t h (@ManlnTheHoody) March 17, 2020  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
