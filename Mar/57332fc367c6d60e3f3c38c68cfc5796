The Jigawa Government has directed its workers to work from home for two weeks with effect from Wednesday, March 24. Alhaji Hussein Killa, the state’s Head of Civil Service, said this at a joint briefing with the state’s Commissioner for Information Mr Muhammad Sani and state’s Commissioner for Health Dr Abba Zakari, on Tuesday in Dutse. Killa said that the directive was part of measures taken at the State Executive Council meeting aimed at protecting workers from getting exposed to Covid-19. He said workers would be working from home with the exception of those on essential duties and those whose jobs required them to be on their duties posts. Killa said also exempted were workers in Ministries of Health, Finance and Water Resources. Also speaking, Zakari announced that all government functions and social gatherings had been suspended with immediate effect. He also said that hand-washing facilities had been provided for people entering motor parks and markets, among others. “Anybody observed to be coughing in motor parks should not be allowed to travel with other passengers in the same vehicle. Our attention must be drawn to such a person for immediate action,” Zakari said. Similarly, Sani said the government had approved the use of the state Council of Ulama’a, Traditional Rulers to enlighten the people on the need to take precautionary measures against Covid-19 spread.
