Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez was due to speak at a cabinet meeting at 1300 GMT to announce the state of alert and new measures expected to limit the movement of people. On Friday said the government would adopt a series of extraordinary measures in order “to mobilise all the resources of state to better protect the health of all of its citizens”.

The Madrid region, which is the country’s worst-hit with nearly 3,000 cases, has ordered the closure of all non-essential businesses.
