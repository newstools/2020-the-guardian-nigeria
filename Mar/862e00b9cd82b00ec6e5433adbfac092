Their son, Chet Hanks released a video statement that: “They’re still self-quarantined obviously, but they’re feeling a lot better so that’s a relief,” he further requested that people should not panic. Hanks and his wife, Wilson, both 63, said they tested positive for the coronavirus last Wednesday. Hanks was in Australia filming a movie about the life of Elvis Presley when this happened. Yesterday, Idris Elba also announced that he has the virus and he is presently in isolation while urging people not to panic and go for tests if they feel any of the symptoms of Covid 19. Mikel Arteta had also come out to say he is now okay days after he tested positive for the virus Covid 19. Among stars that have been tested positive for this virus are Juventus centre-back Daniele Rugani, Sampdoria stars Manolo Gabbiadini, Omar Colley, Albin Ekdal, Antonio La Gumina, Morten Thorsby and Fabio Depaoli, Chelsea winger Callum Hudson-Odoi, and lots more. However, they have all come out to say they are getting better which indicates that it is possible to be cured of the infection.
