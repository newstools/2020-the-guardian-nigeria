Former president of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) Dr. Olisa Agbakoba (SAN) has declared that the collaboration between two leading firms in Nigerian and Indian will help in providing legal services in multiple jurisdictions.
  
The firms, Olisa Agbakoba Legal (OAL) and Capstone Legal are the first tie-ups between the two nations, structured in the form of a memorandum of understanding and meant to provide legal services to international clients.
   
According to Agbakoba, the synergy between the two leading firms is a very significant development in the context of growing Indo-Nigerian trade and bilateral relations, which is now topping the US $10 billion annually.  Considered one of the fastest-growing law firms in India, Capstone boasts of leading companies such as ACC, HCL Infosystems, Ultratech, Bharti Infratel and the Jaipur Literature Festival as its clients.
   
This tie-up will be particularly beneficial for companies from both nationalities that have business interests in Nigeria/India and for companies who want to enter into the respective markets.
   
“For us, a tie-up with OAL strengthens our international practice and we believe that there is a need for quality legal services involving a combination of Nigerian and Indian Law”, said Vagish Kumar Singh, managing partner of Capstone Legal.
