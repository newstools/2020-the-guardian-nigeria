There is palpable tension and suspense in the air as various interest groups within the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) take disparate positions regarding the planned emergence meeting of the party’s National Executive Committee (NEC).
  
While elements in the party opposed to the meeting expressed optimism that the appeal and application for stay of execution of the FCT High Court interlocutory injunction filed by the embattled National Chairman, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, would get favourable ruling, those in support of the NEC insist that there is no going back on the move to replace the chairman.
  
Oshiomhole’s supporters insist that the Constitution of APC does not envisage a situation whereby award executive committee would determine disciplinary actions against a member of the NEC or National Working Committee (NWC) and conclude that the suspension of the national chairman amounts to no effect.  He praised South-South APC Caucus for its single-minded resolve to support Giadom’s nomination as Acting National Chairman, stressing that Giadom has “proved himself capable to run the party creditably and in line with the zoning of the post to the South/-South region at the moment.
  
“We need a fearless, but humane and committed democrat like Giadom to grapple with the onerous task of repositioning the party according to the visions of the founding fathers and in accordance with the APC manifesto.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
