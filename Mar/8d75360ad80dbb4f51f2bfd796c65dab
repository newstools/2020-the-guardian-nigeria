This happened on Monday. Apart from decency laws, the pair chose a particularly bad time for their roadside fling, with authorities on alert for breaches of the virus lockdown as reported by The Daily Mail. The pair were accused of ignoring a quarantine rule which bans two people from being in the front or back of a vehicle together. Authorities have been keeping a wary eye on all road vehicles in order to enforce a ban on travel. Italians are only allowed outside to buy food, give or receive medical care, or travel to work if absolutely necessary. Despite the ample opportunities for indoor entertainment, the couple were caught in the act on a road in Mecenate near Milan which has been heavily hit by the outbreak. Elsewhere, a family who was relaxing on a lawn was ordered to move by police in San Donato Milanese near Milan today. The region of Lombardy which includes Milan has had the largest number of cases in Italy and hospitals in the northern province are struggling to cope. Italy is now requiring anyone entering the country to self-isolate for 14 days unless they are only stopping over for 72 hours or can prove that they must go to work. The Italian death toll rose by 345 to 2,503.
