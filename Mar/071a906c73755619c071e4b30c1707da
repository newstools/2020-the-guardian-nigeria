Dr Ismail Adewusi, postmaster general of the Federation, has said that discussions are ongoing to return the collection of stamp duty to the Nigerian Postal Service (NIPOST). Adewusi stated this in a statement after a two-day meeting with NIPOST’s district postal managers in Abuja. NIPOST and the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) had over the years argued about who should collect stamp duty for the Federal Government. Adewusi said the Dr Isa Ali Pantami, minister of Communications and Digital Economy, and the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice were making efforts to achieve a reversal of the stamp duty, which was transferred to the FIRS. “NIPOST is also banking on the assurances of the committees of the National Assembly for legislative assistance to ensure that the stamp duty reverts to NIPOST,” he said. The postmaster general also stated that with the advent of information technology and the introduction of e-based products, the ongoing business of refocusing the organization had become important. He added that the organization would align itself with modern trends if it hoped to survive in a competitive information technology-driven world. Speaking on the conditions of service, he said a committee had been set up to examine all the areas adding that remunerations would however be tied to revenue generation.
