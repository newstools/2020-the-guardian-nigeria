 Scene of the fire at Ajao Estate yesterday.<br />  According to an eyewitness, the cause of the fire could not be immediately ascertained though it started from the sitting room at the upper floor of the building, and would have consumed many houses in the residential neighbourhood but for the prompt response of the firefighters. A truck arrived at the scene barely 15 minutes after the fire broke out from the Oshodi fire station and a second truck arrived minutes later from Ejigbo. “Though the fire consumed the entire flat where it started from and a few surrounding flats, including the duplex behind, it was still good a major tragedy that would have claimed more houses was eventually averted and it was due to the prompt arrival of the fire service.” Also yesterday evening, at about 6:00p.m., a massive fire raged at the slums of Sawmill in Ebute Metta area of Lagos. The inferno was seen by those who drove on the Third Mainland Bridge. As at the time of filing the report, no officials from the emergency agencies were around to put out the fire. Earlier in February, about 15 shops were razed by fire in the inferno that ravaged a complex of shops along Fatai Irawo Street in Ajao Estate. The fire, which was said to have broken out in the area by electricity glitch, ravaged almost all shops in the complex at 34, Fatai Irawo Street, Ajao Estate, destroying goods and properties worth millions of naira, turning the complex to scavengers’ site. The Manager of Wait and Carry Express Cargo, Mr. Emeka John, who owns two warehouses in the complex, had expressed his shocking belief at the extent at which the fire consumed almost all shipped goods in one of his warehouses, stating that only little items could be salvaged.
