A Chief Magistrates’ Court in Yola has fixed March 27 for hearing in a case of cheating, involving the member representing Song Constituency in the Adamawa House of Assembly, Mr Simon Isah. Isa was brought before the court by a Yola-based businessman, Mr Vincent Umeanozie, for refusing to pay the balance of N490,000 for a 25 KVA Denyo generator. Umeanozie said that the generator, valued at N2.490,000, was sold to him on Feb. 20, 2014. The Magistrate, Mr Daniel John, adjourned the hearing due to the absence of the defendant’s counsel, Mr Sule Abu, in court. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Abu sent a message to the court that he had travelled out of town for an urgent matter. Counsel to Umeanozie, Chief Godwin Ehimakhoi, told the court that he had no objection to the adjournment of the case till March 27.
