A man, on Tuesday, suspected to have stolen an Android phone from a lady at the popular Gada Biu market in Jos North local government area of Plateau State was lynched to death. It was learnt that the lady was returning from work at about 8:00 p.m. when a thief lurking around the area snatched her phone while she was making a call and bolted away. An eyewitness stated that those within the vicinity who noticed the incident ran after the thief and eventually caught up with him under the overhead bridge close to the scene of the incident and dragged him to the market area where he was beaten and burnt to death. When journalists visited the scene yesterday, a bystander, simply identified as Joseph, who claimed to have witnessed the mob action, said Gada Biu in the state capital has become a no-go area once it is past 8:00 p.m. He called for security operatives to be drafted to the area in order to reduce attacks on unsuspecting persons.
