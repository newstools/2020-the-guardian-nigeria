Police punish coronavirus lockdown defaulters with sit-ups | Image: The Pioneer As the coronavirus spreads across the globe, many countries have enforced lockdowns as part of the efforts to contain the spread of the deadly virus. However, a number of people keep flouting the restrictions. For such people, the Indian police have found a way to punish defaulters of the lockdown. According to Economic Times, Indian police are making ‘COVIDIOTS’ (a term coined for those flouting restrictions) squat on the road, do sit-ups and make them pose with pamphlets admitting their fault. “Think before you step out during lockdown,” an Indian tweeted along with a 14 second-long video of the police in Andhra Pradesh making defaulters do sit-ups with crossed hands. Similar punishments have also been meted out across the country as photos surface showing people in India’s largest city, Mumbai, forced to exercise as cops stand over them. In the northern city of Meerut, Police are making citizens who break its lockdown hold up signs reading, “I am a friend of coronavirus,” or “I am the enemy of society,” before posting their pictures on Twitter. India enforced a lockdown for its population of more than 1.3 billion on March 24. The lockdown has been proven to be a very effective measure to contain the spread of the coronavirus. In Nigeria, president Muhammadu Buhari imposed a lockdown in Abuja, Lagos and Ogun – the three most affected states in Nigeria. The lockdown will took effect from 11 pm on Monday, 30th March 2020.
