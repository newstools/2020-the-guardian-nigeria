The number of novel coronavirus cases in the world is approaching 100,000 and more than 3,300 have proved fatal. The Netherlands now has 82 reported cases. “The man was isolated as soon as it became clear that he had COVID-19,” the RIVM said. Everyone who had contact with the patient — including visitors and health workers — is being questioned about their health, the institute said. “All those in contact with the patient who is suffering from a cold or has a fever have been asked to remain at home. If necessary, they will be tested,” the RIVM added. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
