Wife of the Abia State governor and founder of Vicar Hope Foundation, Dr. Nkechi Ikpeazu, has voiced out her rage against reports of increasing gender-based violence, sexual abuses of minors and upsurge in pedophilia across the country. She spoke at the weekend while receiving members of the International Federation of Women Lawyers (FIDA), officers of the state Ministry of Women Affairs, led by the Commissioner of Women Affairs, Ukachi Amala, and the Project Director of the Methodist Motherless Babies Home Uzuakoli, Reverend Joshua Okpara. The groups were accompanied by two minors, aged three and four, alleged to be victims of sexual abuse and molestation that occurred last year in a village in Umuahia South LGA in the state. According to report, the two minors were rescued from their abusive environment through the collaboration of FIDA after a Good Samaritan drew their attention to the plight of the kids. Mrs. Ikpeazu, while expressing surprise and disappointment that even after a year of manhunt, the police are yet to effect the arrest of the suspected abusers of the minors, stressed that cases of child rights abuse ought to be diligently investigated with the culprits prosecuted. She commended FIDA, Uzuakoli Motherless Babies Home and others for caring for the kids and keeping them in school and assured that she will continue to provide for their upkeep and education, adding that the children will remain in the care of the home and under the supervision of the Ministry of Women Affairs until they are certified safe to return to their families.
