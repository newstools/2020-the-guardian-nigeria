In a bid to secure and protect children from domestic violence, Child Protection Network, Lagos State recently organised a stakeholders’ meeting to proffer solutions to the menace. The meeting held in Ibeju Lekki Local Council, attracted community leaders, traditional leaders, women market leaders and non-governmental organisations among others.One of the stakeholders, Mrs. Maryann Adegoke-Mapenzi, advised parents, caregivers and guardians on safety rules for children, as well as for them to be aware of sensitive parts of their bodies.
 
She urged parents to listen more and observe their children to avoid being victims of domestic violence and sexual abuse.
She said: “If someone touches you inappropriately, here is what you should do: Tell the person to, ‘stop it’ and shout for help. Then run away and tell your mummy and daddy, or any trusted adult.”
 
Florence Adewale representing Lagos State government lamented that children’s right are being violated and the society most time does nothing about it. She said it is time for communities to protect children and ensure cases of abuses are reported to the appropriate authorities. From the office of public defender, Mrs Otu, who lamented the alarming cases of child abuses, mentioned the Child Right Law as the rights listed in a special law for children.She beckoned on the children badly beaten and punished by their parents or guardian to alert their office for urgent action.
