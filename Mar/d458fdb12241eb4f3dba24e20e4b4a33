The Lagos State Government has confirmed the authenticity of Short Message Service (SMS) messages forwarded to residents who are 60 years and above as part of measures adopted in the distribution of stimulus food package in the state. The State Commissioner for Agriculture, Mr Gbolahan Lawal, made the clarification in a statement in Lagos on Monday. He said that SMS messages from the Lagos State Residents Registration Agency (LASRRA) were sent to the aged. The stimulus food package unveiled by the state government on March 27, comes in packs of raw food items, to be distributed to every local government in the state. It is aimed at cushioning the effects of the 14-day lockdown directive by the state and Federal Governments. The stimulus package contains bags of rice, beans, garri, bread, dry pepper, drinking water and vitamins.
