Nigeria must make deliberate efforts to address the scourge of terrorism, by standing up to terrorists, and ensuring access to justice for victims in a gender-sensitive manner, the United Nations Office On Drugs and Crime (UNODC), has said. Its Country Representative, Oliver Stolpe, said even though some efforts were ongoing, a groundswell still needs to be done. In a statement, he said: “We are very pleased to be able to support together with the European Union our Nigerian partners’ efforts in this struggle. UNODC is greatly encouraged by the Government of Nigeria’s recognition of the core role of women and girls as actors in preventing and countering violent extremism through its National Action Plan to implement resolution 1325 and the Policy Framework and National Action Plan for Preventing and Countering Violent Extremism, and its efforts to mainstream gender throughout the criminal justice system more broadly. “In 2020, we celebrated the 20th anniversary of the United Nations Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), which stresses the importance of women’s contribution to peace and security and sets forth an ambitious agenda to promote gender equality and enhance the rights, participation, and protection of women in conflict and post-conflict situations.” UNODC stated that the International Women’s Day provided an opportunity to also reflect on how women and men can be differently impacted by terrorism.
