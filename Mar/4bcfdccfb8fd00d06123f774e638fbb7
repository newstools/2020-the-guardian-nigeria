PHOTO: TWITTER/GOVERNOR KADUNA The former emir of Kano Muhammadu Sanusi II arrived in Lagos late Friday from Nasarawa State via Abuja. His departure from Nasarawa came after Justice Anwuli Chikere of a federal high court in Abuja declared granted an interim order releasing him from his “detention” in Awe, Nasarawa. The Judge fixed March 26 for hearing on the matter. Sanusi left Nasarawa in company of Kaduna State governor Nasir El-Rufai, who appointed into the board of Kaduna State Investment Promotion Authority and as the chancellor of Kaduna State University within 48 hours of his dethronement. His arrival in Lagos capped a tumultuous week that saw him being removed from office by the Kano State Government and exiled to Awe. The secretary to the state government said he was sacked because of his “total disrespect to lawful instructions from the office of the governor and other lawful authorities.” Although many of his supporters believe he was deposed because of his rocky relationship with Kano State governor Umaru Ganduje, Sanusi said his sack as emir was an act of God.
