Political parties have been asked to initiate standing rules that could give 60 per cent of their elective and appointive offices to women as a way of deepening democracy and improving women participation in governance. The traditional ruler of Isikwe-Achi kingdom, HRH, Igwe Mbaelu Chucks Obinna, stated this at Achi-Oji River council, Enugu State, during an enlightenment programme for women in the area as part of the 2020 International Women’s day celebration. Speaking during the programme organised by a non-governmental organisation, the South Saharan Social Development Organisation (SSSDO), the monarch explained that the country had not developed as expected because women had been relegated in politics. Explaining that women are torchbearers and are now considered as cabinet members in his kingdom, he said a good number of them have excelled in their chosen professions, stressing that certain organisations doing well are headed by women. Lawyer and woman activist, Mrs. Chinyere Gbugu, advised women to demonstrate leadership at all times by living up to their role as mothers, stressing that they were key to the development and growth of any society. SSSDO’s Programme Officer, Gender and Child Protection, Blessing Uchendu, said the organisation was poised to promote a society where sustainable vision was achieved for children and youths, stressing that it has continued to offer opportunities to the vulnerable. She stated that working with a group of women it formed in some communities in Enugu State under the moniker Sister Guardians, the organisation had been able to bring to the fore certain practices that inhibit women participation and advancement in the society.
