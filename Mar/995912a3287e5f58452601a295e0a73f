Family of 32-year-old Richard Osakue Ajayi, who is being detained by the police in a correctional centre in Nasarawa State has sent a Save-Our-Soul to President Muhammadu Buhari, Inspector-General of Police (IGP) and the Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF) to wade into the matter and save him from being killed for the sin he did not commit.
 
Richard was transferred from the Lagos State police command to FCT Command, Abuja before he was sent to Nasarawa prison. His mother, Mrs. Grace Ajayi, who spoke to newsmen in Lagos at the weekend, said she wanted to keep the presidency, IGP and AGF abreast of the traumatic experience her family is going through in the hands of the police.  “Usolor and his people kept disturbing my son, warning that they would deal with him if he failed to pay. While the interaction was going on between the two, Usulor killed the lawyer. It was through the call log that the police traced my son’s number. But after investigation, SCIID discovered that my son’s interactions with Usolor was basically on lectures and not associated with the murder and granted him bail. “After setting my son free following the DPP’s advice, we were shocked when SCIID came for his arrest again, saying that a new Commissioner of Police has just resumed office and that the lawyer’s husband petitioned him. The police took Richard to Abuja. This time around, they detained him in Nassarawa prisons without trial.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
