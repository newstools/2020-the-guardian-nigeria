Davido and Chioma in 1 Milli When Davido released his sophomore album “A Good Time,” the track “1 Milli” began to trend and one can attribute this to its message being one that resonates with the general public. The song that is about a story of love and marriage was amplified further as it coincided with Davido’s recent engagement to Chioma Rowland. The multiple award-winning singer has now released a music video to the song and he uses his lover, Chioma as his muse. In the video, the smitten lover confesses his love for Chioma as he also gives us a sneak peek of what to expect from their forthcoming wedding. Just like the duo did with “Assurance,” they make you want to fall in love. Watch the video of “I Milli” below:
