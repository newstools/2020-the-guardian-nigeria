In the wake of The Daily Show’s preparation to go audience-free in order to protect fans from the coronavirus outbreak, host Trevor Noah decided to part with his studio audience with a proper goodbye. On Friday’s (March 13) episode, which marks the last featuring a live audience, Noah plays the piano to serenade the crowd before bidding farewell. “Is it still a joke if no one laughs at it? / Am I still a host if I’m just standing in an empty room? / Audience, this is for you,” he begins his dramatic piano ballad. Noah then goes on to thank all types of audience members, from those who stand, wave and cheer to those who don’t laugh, those with weird laughs and even the people who forget to turn off their phones during the show. “It will mess me up and spoil jokes,” he notes, “But, you know, I liked hearing the ringtone. It was so retro.” The song comes following Noah’s announcement that he will also be postponing his scheduled tour dates for the next month. The Daily Show is among a list of other live television shows that have nixed audiences to protect from coronavirus, including The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, The Late Show With Steven Colbert, Late Night With Seth Meyers and Full Frontal With Samantha Bee, Wendy Williams’ show, among others.
