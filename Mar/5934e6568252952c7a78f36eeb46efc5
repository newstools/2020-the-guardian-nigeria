Kebbi State Chairman of Nigerian Union of Teachers (NUT), Comrade Isa A. Umar, has debunked allegations that the National President of the Union, Comrade Nasiu Idris, is behind the failure of the state government to implement the N30,000 minimum wage, as well as the payment of 2019 annual leave grants. Umar stated this, yesterday, while on phone with The Guardian on phone, that Idris had no knowledge of the negotiations between Kebbi State Government and Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC). He urged people to disregard the information, and expressed dismay over the development. He added that the president was not in the country, as he had travelled to the United Kingdom for official assignment. He urged the people to verify their information before going on air, as dialogue was still the best option. In a related development, the Kebbi State NLC Chairman, Comrade Umar Halidu Alhassan, has told civil servants in the state to work progress of the state, not to be a rubber stamp to government. He said: “We still have to write a reminder to the Head of Service that the government has failed to honour its agreements to pay leave grant to junior staff and bring out a salary table for new minimum wage.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
