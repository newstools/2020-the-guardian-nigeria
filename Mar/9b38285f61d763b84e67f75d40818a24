Deposed Kano emir Muhammadu Sanusi in the company of Kaduna State governor Nasir El-Rufai on Friday left Awe, a community in Nassarawa State where he was exiled by the Kano State Government. Sanusi has been resident in the community for over four days since the Kano Government dethroned him and consequently evicted him from the palace. “His highness is leaving, and we are going to Abuja and possibly to Lagos where part of his family is,” El-Rufai told journalists in Awe, Nassarawa State. The deposed emir has been kept in the community in the company of security operatives. His departure comes after a Federal High Court in Abuja on Friday ordered the release of Sanusi from detention in Awe. The judge Justice Anwuli Chikere granted the interim order following an ex parte application moved by Sanusi’s lawyer Lateef Fagbemi (SAN). The judge also ordered that the order for the release of the deposed monarch should be served on the respondents to the application. Sanusi, accompanied by El-Rufai, had earlier on Friday led a Juma’at prayer at the Awe central mosque. The prayer lasted from 2:00 pm till 2:44 pm In his sermon, the dethroned emir Sanusi called on Muslim fellows to always trust in God whatever they face in life because nothing is above His power.
