The Uruguay international, 24, was taken off on a stretcher early on during the 2-0 FA Cup win at Portsmouth last week and was later seen leaving Fratton Park on crutches. The club said on Monday that his “recovery process (is) expected to take between eight to ten weeks”. Speaking on Thursday, before the weekend win over West Ham, Gunners head coach Mikel Arteta had said he was hoping Torreira would be able to play again this season. But that now looks highly unlikely given the diagnosis and how long it would take him to get back up to speed. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
