She affirmed that through courses like medicine, law and engineering are more valued by the society, parents should not, as a result, compel their children to go into the profession when they don’t have passion for it, cautioning that the outcome might not be pleasing.  In the past, courses like medicine, law, and engineering are considered great, but there are many other unpopular courses that also guarantee lucrative jobs, especially in the new information technology (IT) age, there are hundreds of new lucrative IT-based jobs. “Instead of parents forcing their children to study courses that are believed to be lucrative, they should encourage them to study courses based on their strength and interest. At our school, our goal is to give our students a quality education that builds a solid foundation for whatever course they want to study in the university or college. We also guide them to choose courses based on their strength and passion.”
 
She continued, “Last year, we launched our career, college and university readiness centres and introduced new software called “Maia Learning”. The software enables our high school students to take personality tests and the results are used to recommend courses that suit the personality of each student. The students get to discover their areas of strengths and learn about profitable courses that are in line with their passion. And as it turned out, the students and their parents are happy, because the software helped both to achieve their objectives.”
  
She further encouraged parents to listen to their children when it’s time to choose a course of study, as it is an important period in their lives. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
