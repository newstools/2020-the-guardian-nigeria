Gov. Gboyega Oyetola of Osun has ordered civil servants in the state to stay at home for two weeks, as part of measures to curtail the spread of coronavirus. Oyetola in a statement signed by the Secretary to the State Government, Mr Wole Oyebamiji in Osogbo on Tuesday, said workers from Levels 1 to 12 should stay at home for two weeks starting Tuesday (today). According to him, the stay at home order is part of precautionary measures to forestall any possible outbreak of coronavirus in the state. The governor, however, said workers on essential services such as health, environmental sanitation, fire service, among others, were not affected by the directive. “All officers on essential services in Health and Medical facilities, Environmental Sanitation, Fire Services, Water Corporation and all other essential services are to be reporting for duty as usual. “It will be noted that the coronavirus has not spread to this state but the government will not spare any effort that will make the state continue to be free of this pandemic coronavirus,” Oyetola said.
