 Muhammadu Buhari  Till date, Buhari has not made any state of the nation’s address on coronavirus pandemic and that is strange, though not unfamiliar. It is no longer news that President Buhari’s aloofness is remarkable. He enjoys talking to us from overseas as if Nigerians were leprous. After all, he did not care when citizens were getting killed in Benue and even in his home state, Katsina. He could not be troubled when Abule-Ado community in Lagos exploded and more than 20 killed the other day. He did not bat an eyelid even when his presidency was nearly going up in flames over rift between the national security adviser and chief of staff.
