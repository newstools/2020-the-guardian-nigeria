• Governor denies plan to dethrone any traditional ruler
Ekiti State Governor Kayode Fayemi has issued query to the 16 most prominent traditional rulers in Ekiti State, called the Pelupelu Obas, over alleged insubordination. There has been no love lost between the foremost monarchs and Fayemi over the appointment of the Alawe of Ilawe-Ekiti, Oba Adebanji Alabi, as Chairman of the State Traditional Council. Angered by the development, the Pelupelu Obas had approached the state high court to challenge the appointment of the Alawe of Ilawe as chairman of the traditional council. The monarchs described the appointment as a clear violation of the Ekiti State Chieftaincy Law.They, therefore, resolved to boycott state functions and meetings where Oba Alabi would preside as the chairman. However, disturbed by the continuous boycott of state functions, the Bureau of Chieftaincy Affairs, acting on the directive of the governor, issued the monarchs query, which they must respond to within 72 hours. Meanwhile, Fayemi has denied any plan to remove any traditional ruler in the state. According to the governor, the letter written to the foremost monarchs was merely an administrative matter, which was neither contentious nor confrontational. The governor, who stated this in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Yinka Oyebode, said:  “The letter in focus was written to only about 11 Obas whose absence could not be explained and not to the 16 Pelupelu Obas as erroneously reported,” he said.
