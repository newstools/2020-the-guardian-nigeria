Gov. Bello Matawalle of Zamfara has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Dubai-based Worldwide Jet Aviation SA, for helicopters to carry out aerial surveillance on criminal hideouts in the state. A statement signed by Zailani Bappa, the Special Adviser to the governor on Public Affairs and made available to journalists in Gusau on Friday said the agreement was sealed in Dubai when the governor visited the United Arab Emirate, recently. He explained that the Dubai security firm would supply MBB BO105 Bell 206 surveillance helicopters under the agreement aimed at checkmating the resurgence of banditry in the state. Bappa added that the American model choppers were recently remodelled for advanced security surveillance; convenient for the war against terror in the state and its environs. “The helicopters are rugged and have camera capacities as well as a three-hour stretch capacity for surveillance trip, with a maximum speed of 224 km per hour and are equipped with tracker systems. “When procured, the choppers are expected to be deployed for security surveillance and aerial patrol in the forests, borders, and towns across the state in conjunction with the Nigeria Police and other security agencies,” he said.
