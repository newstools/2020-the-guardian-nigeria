The Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) has altered services in its parishes in Lagos and Ogun State in compliance with both government’s directive to curb coronavirus. RCCG’s assistant general overseer (administration and personnel) Folrunsho Odesola said in an internal memo that the church is amending its worship schedules as a precautionary step towards managing the spread of coronavirus. “Parishes that have an average attendance of above 50 members are directed to make use of their House Fellowship Centres to run simultaneous services with the main church,” Odesola said. Lagos and Ogun states on Wednesday, March 18, 2020, directed a suspension of religious and social gatherings with over 50 people to avoid further spreading of coronavirus. Lagos State also directed the closure of public and private schools from Monday, March 23. Seven out of the eight cases of coronavirus that Nigeria has recorded as at Thursday, March 19, 2020, are in Lagos. The first case of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) confirmed in Lagos State is an Italian citizen who works in Nigeria who returned from Milan to Lagos on the 25, Tuesday, February 2020. The Italian was in Ogun State at the weekend before entering Lagos. Odesola said RCCG churches in both states that have an average attendance of 50 members or less can hold their service without any changes “under the strict directive that worshippers won’t exceed 50 people per service.” “Kindly be informed that this arrangement shall be in operation for the next few weeks, based on the position of the government.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
