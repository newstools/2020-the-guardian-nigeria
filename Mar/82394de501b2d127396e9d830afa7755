Executive Vice Chairman (EVC) of the National Agency for Science and Engineering Infrastructure (NASENI), Prof. Mohammed Haruna, has identified lack of funding of innovations as a major challenge for Nigeria. He made the submission yesterday in his welcome address at the ongoing fourth Science and Technology Expo themed “Delivering Science and Engineering Infrastructure to Enhance the Growth of a Diversified Economy” in Abuja. Haruna submitted that countries that had succeeded in addressing socio-economic development challenges had one thing in common – heavy investment in research and development.
