Worried by the rising security challenges in the country, the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) said it is collaborating with security operatives to nab kidnappers and others who use SIM cards for wrong purposes. The Executive Vice Chairman of the commission, Professor Umar Danbatta, made this known while speaking at the 41st Kaduna International Trade Fair, organised by the Kaduna Chamber of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture (KADCCIMA). Danbatta was represented by the Director, Zonal Services, Mrs. Amina Shehu. When asked what NCC was doing to apprehend kidnappers using phone calls to demand ransom after kidnapping, she said: “NCC, as a regulator, is doing so much with regards to security of lives of all Nigerians. “One of the fundamental things we are doing to nab all this evil perpetrators is to ensure that your SIM cards are captured and registered. We also understand that there are those who evade the registration of SIM cards. As a result of this, we have a Code Compliance Monitoring and Enforcement Department responsible for making sure that people who registered wrongly or particularly with intent to perpetrate evil act are apprehended. “Once we get hold of them, we do the needful. We work in partnership with security operatives to be able to nab some of the people who registered wrongly.” Mrs. Shehu assured telecommunications consumers of better services to improve their businesses, saying the NCC is a consumer-centric organisation poised to developing consumer protection initiatives, like complaint channels. “We have developed the Do-Not-Disturb Code to stop all unsolicited messages and Mobile Number Portability to enable changing from one service provider without changing ones’ mobile number,” she added.
