North West makes her rap debut at the Paris fashion week, with Kanye West by her side | Photo: Getty Images North West, surprisingly, made her rap debut as she opened for her father’s surprise Yeezy Paris Fashion Week showcase on Monday evening. The six-year-old daughter of Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, followed in her dad’s musical footsteps as she belted the lyrics while the models presented the brand’s neutral-toned Autumn/Winter 2020 collection. She rocked a braided hairdo and was the pure representation of confidence as she took to the stage in front of the massive crowd, which featured her proud parents Kim, 39, and Kanye, 42, as well as auntie Kourtney, 40, and her cousin Penelope Disick, seven. Kanye West returned to showing his Yeezy collections with a season 8 runway presentation during Paris Fashion Week after a two-year hiatus. While the return of Yeezy was in its own worthy of discussion, most of the conversation about the fashion show rather centered on the debut vocal performance of North West. While this is the first time that North has performed publicly, this is far from her first time doing the fashion month circuit; when she was just over a year old, North had her own front-row seat at the Givenchy show in 2014, where she sat, resplendent in a custom black Givenchy dress. For this time around at Paris Fashion Week, however, North opted for a more sporty look, wearing a neutral matching pant set and a bright fuchsia padded gilet. See her performance below.
