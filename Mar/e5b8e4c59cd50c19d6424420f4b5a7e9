These myths are most often out of fear and are maintained as a coping mechanism. However, these myths might put people at risk as some are very dangerous to the health, especially during this pandemic period. Find below some of these myths: Use Alcohol
During this period, you need your immunity to be perfect. Consuming Alcohol will only put you at risk. Some people believe spraying themselves with sanitizing products can help protect them from the coronavirus. This is untrue, according to Frederick Davis, DO, associate chair, emergency medicine at Northwell Health, Long Island Jewish Medical Center. “The coronavirus enters the body through mucous membranes like the mouth and nares, so spraying your body with alcohol, chlorine, or other surface disinfectants will not prevent infections. While these substances can be effective means to disinfect surfaces and prevent transmission of viruses, the same chemicals on the skin can be harmful to a person and should not be applied in that manner.” Ordering or Buying Products Shipped From Other Countries Can Infect You
Researchers are studying the new coronavirus to learn more about how it infects people. Most viruses, like this one, do not stay alive on surfaces for a prolonged time period, explains Dr. Bhayani. “It is not likely that you would get COVID-19 from a package that was in transit for days or weeks. The illness is most likely transmitted by droplets from an infected person’s sneeze or cough, but more information is emerging daily.” Your Pharmacist Or Physician Can Test You
So far, testing has been limited to individuals who traveled recently to countries with many COVID-19 cases or those who had been in close contact with someone who had the infection, but health experts are working hard to expand testing capabilities. In Nigeria, only the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control can carry out the test. Contact them if you need to get tested. Surgical Mask Prevents The Virus
Speaking on the use of Surgical, Nikhil Bhayani, MD, infectious diseases specialist at Texas Health Resources in Bedford, said: They may provide some protection from large drops, sprays or splashes, but because they don’t fit tightly, they may allow tiny infected droplets to get into the nose, mouth or eyes. Also, people with the virus on their hands who touch their faces under a mask might become infected. The most effective prevention method is to wash your hands and avoid touching your face. There Is Medicine For Coronavirus
All viruses, including the flu, cannot be treated with antibiotics and the coronavirus is no different. Additionally, none of the antivirals that are for treating other viral illnesses work for the coronavirus. However, take in enough fluids and Vitamins and stay at home. Remember to maintain the utmost cleanliness, stay home, eat well, wash your hands and take fruits.
