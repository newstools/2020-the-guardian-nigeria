About 11,000 trainees that are undergoing training at the Industrial Training Fund (ITF’s) National Industrial Skills Development Programe (NISDP), would soon graduate. A statement from the Fund, quoted the Director-General/Chief Executive Officer, Joseph Ari, as re-affirming ITF’s commitment to ensuring full actualisation of its mandate, to grow the national economy. Ari said the beneficiaries, whose training commenced in the last quarter of 2019, were equipped with skills in nine trades, namely: Leather Works (Shoe and Bag Making), Welding and Fabrication, Catering and Event Management, Tiling, Production and Laying of Interlock Tiles, Furniture Making, Domestic Electrical Wiring and Installation, Solar Energy Installation, Plumbing and Pipefitting, and Autogelle and Beauty Care. He explained that these trade areas were chosen in view of their potential to provide sustainable livelihoods for the beneficiaries in view of the need for people with such skills. He noted that like previous beneficiaries of the programme, the graduates would be empowered with the start-up packs to start their own businesses. He also urged parents and guardians to encourage their children and wards to embrace skills acquisition, as white collar jobs were no longer available. He added that the only way for President Buhari to actualise his pledge to take 100 million Nigerians out of poverty before the end of his tenure, was for individuals to acquire skills, and reaffirmed the determination of the ITF to ensure that as many as possible were equipped with relevant skills for employability and growth. He also disclosed that the Fund’s projects, which include the Lagos Island Area Office Complex, the Headquarters’ Library Complex in Jos, the Mechatronics Workshop at Industrial Skills Training Centre (ISTC) Kano, and the Katsina Area Office Complex, would be inaugurated before the end of February.
