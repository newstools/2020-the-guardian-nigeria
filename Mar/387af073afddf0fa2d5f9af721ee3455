The Rapid Response Squad (RRS) of Lagos State government yesterday gave clarifications on the picture caption on front page of The Guardian on Monday March 23, 2020. The security outfit noted that God’s Chamber Church, which was among the churches visited by the RRS Commander, Tunji Disu, complied with the directives of the government. Spokesman of the RRS, Moliki Femi, said: “We refer to one of the pictures on the Monday, March 23, 2020 edition of your newspaper. “The picture bordering on the visit of Rapid Response Squad’s Enforcement team to God’s Chamber Church, Ajayi Road, Aguda, Ikeja, Lagos, was wrongly captioned. “The church was one the churches that complied completely and also relayed its service online. The pastor even went as far as praying for the team and health workers involved in combating the scourge of Coronavirus. “We are aware that the church is bothered by the wrong captioning and therefore wish to appeal, being the provider of the picture, to kindly help redress.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
