Sports minister Sunday Dare said Buhari took the decision after a briefing with state of health minister Olorunmibe Mamora in Abuja. “Following the briefing of Mr President from myself and the Minister of State for Health on COVID 19, Mr President approved the immediate postponement of Edo Sports festival to a future date,” Dare said in a tweet on Tuesday. Dare said the president’s decision was aimed at taking preventive measures against the spread of coronavirus. Prior to Buhari’s order, Dare assured Nigerians that the ministry will make a decision in the best interest of the public. He, however, said the youth and sports ministry was working closely with the health ministry and competent health authorities on the coronavirus spread and the threat it poses to sports gatherings. “Properly guided, we will take the best decision in the interest of public health safety,” Dare said hours before the postponement. The National Sports Festival (NSF) Edo 2020 was slated to begin on Sunday, March 22, 2020, to Wednesday, April 1 in Benin City. The postponed sporting event joins other sporting activities that have been put to a halt due to the spread of coronavirus. Organisers of Tokyo 2020 Olympics and Euro 2020 may bow to pressure to postpone the global events after football competitions in Europe, America, Asia and North America have been suspended to prevent coronavirus spread.
