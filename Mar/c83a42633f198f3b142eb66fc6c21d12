  Sule, who disclosed this yesterday at a press briefing in Government House, Lafia, added: “We decided to isolate ourselves to avoid the spread of the disease because I had contact with two persons who have been tested positive to the virus. “The result of our test is out and I, my deputy and the Emir of Lafia tested negative.” The governor threatened to arrest any Imam that conducts prayers at any major mosques that have been strictly warned not to gather people for prayers. For churches and mosques, Sule had specifically warned that worshipers in any congregation should not exceed 50 persons for now, but the governor was not specific on total lockdown of markets in the state, explaining that he would not want to bring any hardship on citizens, as many had not stocked foodstuffs. Sule urged the people to abide strictly to social with the distancing rule and report any suspected cases to curtail the spread of the virus, assuring that the state government has equipped five isolation centres with modern facilities in Keffi, Toto, Karu and Lafia because of their proximity to the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja.
