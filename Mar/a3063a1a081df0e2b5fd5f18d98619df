APC chieftain in Kaduna, Yusuf Ali (Rabagardama) described the Kano chapter of the party as an ungrateful bunch, which chose to drag the Kaduna governor, Nasir el-Rufai, in the mud over the Sanusi saga. Ali said Kano APC forgot so quickly how el-Rufai contributed to the progress of the party in Kano.“We read the sad commentary by one Shehu Maigari from the APC office in Kano. He struggled on the pages of some newspapers to disparage Governor el-Rufai for showing love and support to his friend, the former Emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi II. “This clearly shows that supporting the Kano APC is like casting pearls before swine, who will certainly not appreciate or recognise the efforts and role el-Rufai played in the most difficult moment in the life of the party in Kano in 2019. “Today, it is convenient for the Kano APC to call el-Rufai names while ignoring that he spared no effort in ensuring that Ganduje retained his seat as the elected governor of Kano in 2019, even when the odds were against him,” he stated. Ali said that Kano APC as presently constituted had actually played no significant role in the emergence of APC as the ruling party in Kano and Nigeria in 2015. According to him, it was the untiring effort of people like Senator Rabiu Kwankwaso, el-Rufai and others across Nigeria who pulled resources together to ensure that APC won in Kano and other states as well as at the federal level. “Let’s go down memory lane. The emergence of APC as the ruling party in Nigeria and Kano in 2015 had no contribution from the likes of Ganduje and his supporters because at that time they were mere lackeys who were carrying bag for Kwankwaso. “But el-Rufai at that time was a dominant figure in politics and one of its pillars, having served as the secretary of the defunct CPC that merged with other parties to form the APC,” he added.
