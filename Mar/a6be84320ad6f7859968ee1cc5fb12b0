The Foundation for Partnership Initiative in the Niger Delta (PIND) has canvassed a collaborative development of ideas, solutions and responsibilities by stakeholders to deepen gender equality in the region. Its Deputy Executive Director, Tunji Idowu, represented by James Elekwachi, Economic Development Manager, while speaking at the weekend during a gender equality advocacy roundtable in Warri, Delta State, noted that effective dialogue and shared learning were crucial to the development of the area. The event was organised to review PIND and its partners’ gender mainstreaming progress in the last 10 years in the oil-rich zone. He explained that gender mainstreaming was not only about including women as intervention beneficiaries, but also about deliberately addressing issues limiting their economic and social well-being. Idowu disclosed that that the foundation’s economic development programme grows businesses, boosts productivity and income for small-holder farmers and micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMES) as well as strengthens conflict resolution mechanism and fosters stability through a regional network of peace actors and an early warning and response structure. Besides, the Federal Government has empowered women and youths in the region with sewing machines and other accessories as well as equipping ICT centres, hospitals, schools, among others. The Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Godswill Akpabio, made the disclosure at the close of a training and empowerment programme for the beneficiaries in Abuja. He said the move was in line with the current administration’s drive to diversify the economy. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
