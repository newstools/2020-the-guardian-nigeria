Amid the coronavirus pandemic, many celebrities have been going live on social media and revealing a bit more than planned about their innermost thoughts and most especially their private lives just as Lovato has done. Over the past week, multiple reports claimed the “I Love Me” singer is linked to former “Young and the Restless” actor Max Ehrich. But, it was all mostly speculation until Lovato ‘party-crashed’ while Ehrich was recently performing for fans during an Instagram Live. In the clip, Ehrich looks offscreen while seated at the piano, as an unaware Lovato enters the frame, snuggled up in a blanket. “I’m on live! I’m on live,” he tells her in a whisper, before she puts the pieces together, realizing she’s on camera. Lovato and Ehrich clearly intended on keeping their romance under wraps, with the singer almost immediately covering her face with the blanket, as they break out into giggles. Her exit, however, wasn’t quick enough for fans to miss her appearance While neither Lovato or Ehrich have spoken about the rumours, they’ve been leaving flirty comments on each other’s social media posts. E! News also reports that the lovebirds “have been quarantining together at Demi’s house and it’s going really well”. Since Lovato’s hospitalization and a break from the public eye last year, she has maintained a low profile when it comes to romance, except for a brief fling with model Austin Wilson. And she seemed hell-bent on staying single at least for the time being, as stated during an appearance on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” earlier this month.
