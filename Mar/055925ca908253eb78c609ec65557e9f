While the coronavirus pandemic eats through the world, it is important not to overlook the little things. In a bid to curb the spread of the virus, President Muhammadu Buhari has called for a 14-day lockdown of Lagos, Abuja and Ogun states. Which means movement around these states will be closely monitored and restricted unless you fall under the category of people who render essential services. However, while the country is faced with its official lockdown, it is important that business owners, take into consideration the following before finally shutting down their various offices. Avoid Electrical Hazards Due to human nature, we often forget to do things as little of switching off a light bulb when not in use, therefore, ensure that all appliances within your office are switched off. No extensions or adapters should be left plugged into a socket. Take Out The Trash! In as much as the lockdown is a bit impromptu to some companies, there is still enough time to get rid of waste each bin. Even if each bin has just shredded bits of paper, empty them. Keep the office environment tidy. Clean The Kitchen Most offices are equipped with kitchens that give the workspace a somewhat homely feel. But, having different people with their individual characteristics makes it hard to enforce a clean kitchen space at all times. The kitchen bin is just as important as the rest, it must be emptied before the lockdown, to avoid it harbouring flies and a foul welcoming smell once work resumes. Stay Organised The lockdown is not a reason to leave your desk untidy. Arrange your files properly and get rid of any unwanted sheet of paper from your desk. Pull the chairs back into its appropriate spots and exit the building leaving things in place just the way you would like to meet them when you resume in the morning. Ultimately, always remember that cleanliness is next to godliness.
