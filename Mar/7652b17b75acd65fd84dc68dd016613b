DJ iMarkkeyz took advantage of “social distancing” and decided to remix Cardi B’s recent Instagram rant about her coronavirus fears and it went viral. The track was uploaded to iTunes and Apple Music and broke through at No. 96 on the platform’s Hip-Hop/Rap Songs chart. According to Billboard, the song had jumped to No. 5 on the same chart, as well as No. 37 on iTunes overall. Cardi reacted to the news via Twitter with a line from her tirade, “Shit is getting real!” Last week, Cardi B admitted the coronavirus pandemic had her really scared and has been panicking a lot lately. She continued, “A lot of you muthaf***s think it’s a joke like I was thinking, right?” she added. “But that shit right there, just because you think you’re immune to it, guess what? You probably ain’t bi**h ’cause a lot of that shit comes from muth***kin’ China, bi**h. So if you wonder where your muth***in’ weave or your Fashion Nova muthaf**n’ packages haven’t arrived, guess what bi**h? Coronavirus [laughs]! Coronavirus! I’m tellin’ you, shit is real! Shit is getting real.” The aptly titled “Coronavirus” song comes with a radio edit version of the track as well. The cover art features an emoji of DJ iMarkkeyz’s face with a vicious germ exploding out of his nose. Listen to the mash-up below:
