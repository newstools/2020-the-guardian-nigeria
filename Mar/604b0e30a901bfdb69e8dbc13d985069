The recent plot to dethrone Emir of Kano, Mohammadu Sanusi might have suffered a setback, as residents of Ja’en community have disowned the petition forwarded to Kano State House of Assembly. The Assembly, on Monday, instituted a probe panel against Emir Sanusi, after receiving two petitions from one Muhammad Mukhtar, who claimed to be a resident of Ja’en Yamma Quarters and a group called Kano State Society for the Promotion of Education and Culture, led by one Muhammed Bello-Abdullahi. The petitioners submitted documents and video clips indicating the emir of violating cultural, traditional and religious norms of Kano State. Although the petitioners were not physically present at the Assembly, they demanded the lawmakers to investigate their claims and instil necessary disciplinary action against the emir. But in a statement jointly signed by Chairman and Secretary of the group, Tameem Bala Ja’en, and Ibrahim Yahya Ja’en, they insisted the petitions and purported petitioners were never known in their domain. The community declared the monarch has not violated any known abuse to the culture and tradition of Kano people. The group, under the aegis of Ja’en Concerned Citizens Initiative, rather accused the state legislators of selfish interest and political colouration to deposing the former governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).
