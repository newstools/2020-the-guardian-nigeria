 Boxing – Andy Ruiz Jr v Anthony Joshua – IBF, WBA, WBO & IBO World Heavyweight Titles – Diriyah Arena, Diriyah, Saudi Arabia – December 7, 2019 Anthony Joshua celebrates winning his fight against Andy Ruiz Jr.  Action Images via Reuters/Andrew Couldridge  The British boxer posted a picture of himself wearing his belts on his Twitter feed with the words “June 20th”. Joshua regained the WBA, IBF and WBO titles with a unanimous points win over Andy Ruiz Jr in Saudi Arabia in December. That victory saw the Briton avenge the first defeat of his professional career, in New York last June. Joshua is set to face Bulgaria’s Pulev at the new Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in north London. Pulev, who is the mandatory challenger for Joshua’s IBF title, pulled out of a scheduled meeting with the Briton in 2017 due to injury. A much-anticipated all-British “superfight” between Joshua and Tyson Fury suffered a setback when American Deontay Wilder said he would trigger a clause in his contract for a third meeting with the new WBC champion.
