Osun State government has reiterated its commitment to providing potable water supply across the nooks and crannies of the state. The state government said it would collaborate with relevant stakeholders and organisations to ensure improved and adequate water supply to the citizens. The state’s Commissioner for Water Resources and Energy, Dr. Amidu Tadese Raheem, said this yesterday during a press conference by his ministry to commemorate the World Water Day. The conference, which was jointly addressed by the commissioner and the Special Adviser to the Governor on Water Resources and Energy, Adeniran Felix Ibitoye, was aimed at sensitising the public on the significance of water to healthy living and the need for them to maintain personal hygiene. Raheem described water as indispensable to healthy living, saying the administration of Governor Gboyega Oyetola had strengthened the capacity of the ministry towards provision of potable water for the citizens. He said the ministry had been given the mandate to ensure that people of Osun are provided with clean drinking water, stressing that the provision of potable water remains one of the core mandates of the present administration. “This year World Water Day is to emphasise the importance of water to human race and create avenue to discuss how nature-based solutions are sustainable and cost-effective ways to help rebalance the water cycle, mitigate the effect of climate change and improve human health and livelihood. “To ensure that people have access to sustainable water, the governor procured an industrial submersible pump as a palliative measure for the faulty intake structure to bring succour to the people being served by the water scheme,” he said. Ibitoye said: “We have embarked on facility tour of some water works and mini-water schemes in the state. We have held meetings with all the concerned stakeholders and about to sign a Memoranda of Understanding (MoU) with some of our partners. We have also met and consulted with contractors, consultants and firms who are willing to partner with the state government in ensuring that the people of the state enjoy uninterrupted supply of clean and potable water. “We are happy to inform the people that the Ilesa water supply and sanitation project would be delivered within the shortest possible time.” We have been able as a government to partner with the Federal Government through the Federal Ministry of Water Resources and Islamic Development Bank (ISDB) to intervene on this project and ensure timely delivery.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
