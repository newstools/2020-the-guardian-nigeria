They urge people to follow guidance from Public Health England by using video calls to keep in touch with family and friends, sticking to regular routines, and focusing on favourite hobbies or learning something new according to report by The Daily Mail. In the words of the duo: The last few weeks have been anxious and unsettling for everyone. We have to take time to support each other and find ways to look after our mental health. It is great to see the mental health sector working together with the NHS to help people keep on top of their mental wellbeing. By pulling together and taking simple steps each day, we can all be better prepared for the times ahead. They are reaching out to vulnerable groups including older adults and people with underlying health conditions, and also anyone experiencing unstable employment and housing conditions. According to the Minister for Mental Health Nadine Dorries, who has recovered from Covid-19: When I discovered I had coronavirus I felt anxious and scared. For those who already suffer from anxiety or other mental health issues, this may present new and difficult challenges. It’s imperative that we stay home if we are to beat coronavirus and save lives. I know how important it is that people have support to look after their mental health and this guidance will be of huge value. Mental health guidance, which was developed with the input of mental health charities and clinically assured by the NHS, also has points on how to help children manage stress. There is also support for those who are already living with a serious mental health problem, such as how to access help from mental health professionals. During this period, people need as much care as they can especially for their mental health.
