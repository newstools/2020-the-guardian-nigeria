Wetin una even want? — GOD (@iam_clive) March 26, 2020  Unfortunately TB Joshua’s prophecy will not come to pass. Tomorrow there will be new infections around the world but God is bigger than man. Men are flawed. 1 man will not define who God is. Our God is great. — 冠军 (@KayKintu) March 26, 2020  I wonder why people still take TB JOSHUA seriously. This guy, just like every other pastor in Nigeria is not a prophet he just makes predictions. I remember when he said a woman was going to win the presidential Elections in US and Trump won.
