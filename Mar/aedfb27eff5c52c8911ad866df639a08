For the umpteenth time, Issele-Azagba, an agrarian community in Aniocha North Local Government Area of Delta State, has been invaded by criminals suspected to be herders. The community shares boundary with Okpanam, Atuma, Otulu and Ogwashi-Ukwu.
 
The incessant attacks prompted the community to embark on a mass protest to draw the attention of the international community to their plight and to solicit for alternative security measure over the increasing failure of government to protect them. Addressing newsmen at the weekend at the palace of the community’s monarch, Obi Francis Jideuwa, the President General of Issele-Azagba Development Union, Mr. Benneth Uche Iloh, and President General of Issele-Azagba Youth Association, Comrade Ogebgu Edozie, respectively gave accounts of the incessant attacks on the community in what they tagged: ‘Telling Our Story’.  According to the community, “We are under serious siege by these killer Fulani herdsmen. What is most painful is that the Nigerian government has refused to intervene since we started crying for help. We need protection, we are a peace loving community and do not treat our visitors badly. We are sending a strong message to the government that if these attacks continued, we might resort to self help. We have condoned these people for too long, allowing them to graze our land freely and without molestation. But why are they killing us in our own land?”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
