Plans to install VAR in Asaba Stadium
The Delta State government has mapped out plans to screen spectators, match officials and players for the deadly coronavirus (Covid -19) before the 2021 African Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifier against the Leone Stars of Sierra Leone at the Stephen Keshi Stadium, Asaba on March 27. The state’s Commissioner for Sports, Tony Okowa said at the weekend that his ministry was working with the Ministry of Health and the local organising committee to ensure that everybody coming for the game is secured from the virus. Okowa added that every process needed to make the Eagles’ AFCON qualifier successful would be well handled by the state government, while allaying fears over possible deficiency in crowd control on match day. He said a well-coordinated procedure would be used by the LOC to guard against any mishap, adding, “Asaba, for now, does not have any case of the Coronavirus. But that does not mean we will relax. “The LOC for the AFCON qualifier are working together with the health ministry to fashion out how the spectators and officials that would be at Asaba stadium would be screened before entering the match venue. “You should also understand that other people outside the state will be at the stadium to watch the game; so, it is imperative to guide against any eventuality,” he said. Okowa added that plans were also on to install Video Assistant Referee gadgets (VAR) at the Stephen Keshi Stadium soon, adding, “At this point, Stephen Keshi Stadium has a high class scoreboard that can be attached to any device. “I will be speaking with NFF President, Amaju Pinnick on the installation now that the awareness is on. But it will not be used in the Sierra Leone game. “We will install VAR for future engagements as it would also give Delta State the advantage to host FIFA-organised competitions in future,” he added.
