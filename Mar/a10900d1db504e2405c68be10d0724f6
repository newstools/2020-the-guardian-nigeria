Tonight is all about the stars who turned up at Eko Convention Centre for the 7th edition of Africa Magic Viewers’ Choice Awards (AMVCA), As we applaud the celebrities who came to slay and win, we can’t help but point out the few who obviously need to fire their stylists. Taking a look at both male and female celebrities who walked on and posed on tonight’s red carpet, we have compiled a list of some of the worst dressed celebrities at the AMVCA’s. Number 1 on the list is definitely BBNaija 2019 housemate, Omashola. We all know coronavirus is ravaging the earth, but trying to use it as a style inspiration was a total fail! Also, it appears Harry Songz didn’t get the “You must bring your A-Game to any red carpet” memo.

Because, what in the world is Gbemi wearing!? OAP, Gbemi | Photo: Insgtaram/Gbemi See more photos below:
