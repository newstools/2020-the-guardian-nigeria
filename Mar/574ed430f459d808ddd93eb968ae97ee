The Nigerians In Diaspora Commission (NIDCOM) has said Nigeria’s remittances from abroad, estimated at nearly $26 billion yearly, are second only to oil as source of national revenue. The NIDCOM boss, Mrs. Abike Dabiri-Erewa, disclosed this at the Nigerian American Awards (NNA) night in Florida, United States. She pointed out that most of these remittances were informal and uncategorised. During the event, Dabiri-Erewa was conferred with the ‘Visionary Leader of the Year 2020’ for showing exemplary leadership and being outstanding in handling affairs at the commission. She expressed optimism that more organised diaspora groups like the Nigerian-American Business Forum (NABF), would assist in re-channeling energy homewards for the development of the country. Chairman of NAA, Dr. Afolabi Andu, said the award, instituted by the NABF, was to recognise the contributions of Nigerians to change the narrative of the most populous black nation. Governor of Oyo State, Seyi Makinde, was conferred with the ‘Outstanding Leadership Award 2020’ for “exemplary leadership and outstanding performance” in transforming governance landscape in the state.
