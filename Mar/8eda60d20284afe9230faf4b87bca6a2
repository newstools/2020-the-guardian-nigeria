Osun State Health Commissioner Isamotu Rafiu Olasunkanmi on Thursday gave an account of how the state’s coronavirus index case arrived at the state. In a phone interview with Rave FM Osogbo, Olasunkanmi said the patient arrived Lagos from the United Kingdom and drove himself from Lagos to Osogbo on Tuesday. The commissioner said the patient reached out to him to notify him of his arrival from the UK and expressed willingness to test for the virus. “He drove himself to Asubiaro State Hospital where his sample was taken and showed no symptoms,” Olasunkanmi said. “He left Asubiaro and drove to a Hotel in Osogbo but also gave the owner of the hotel a prior notice that he was just returning from the UK and he was not sure of his status, therefore he must not be exposed to any contact,” he added. The commissioner disclosed that the patient slept at the hotel for one night and drove himself to Asubiaro COVID19 Isolation centre for treatment after he tested positive for the virus. Osun State Governor Gboyega Oyetola on Wednesday while confirming the case in a press briefing the patient is currently receiving treatment. The governor and his wife Kafayat Oyetola who had also taken the test for the virus tested negative. Oyetola said he subjected himself to test “considering the fact that I was in Abuja for the better part of last week.” “My dear wife has also been tested because of her recent travel history. Our tests came back negative,” he said. “To this end, I want to passionately encourage all returnees from the UK, US, Europe, the West African Coast & indeed other high-risk countries to self-isolate & submit themselves for test, so as to assist the govt. in containing the spread of the virus,” he said. The governor, like many other state governors, has put out measures to stop the spread of the dreaded virus.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
