Minority Leader of the House of Representatives, Ndudi Elumelu, yesterday said he and members of his family had tested negative for the Coronavirus after a period of isolation in London, United Kingdom. Addressing reporters in Abuja, Elumelu implored his colleagues to also subject themselves to the medical examination. Spokesman for the lower legislative chamber, Benjamin Kalu, had last week denied knowledge of any member testing negative for the virus. The green chamber last Tuesday proceeded on a two-week recess over the virus as well as to follow up on an Economic Stimulus Bill to cushion effects of the pandemic on the economy.
