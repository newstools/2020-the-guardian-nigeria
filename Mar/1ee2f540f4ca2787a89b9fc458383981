The President of Senate, Ahmad Lawan, recently acted with dispatch uncharacteristic of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) when he declared the seats of two Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) senators vacant. Coming barely a few months after some stakeholders in Abia State urged the Senate to declare vacant the Abia North Senatorial seat occupied by the jailed Senate Chief Whip and APC chieftain, Orji Uzor Kalu, the Senate President’s action stoked fresh talks about the politics of partisan arithmetic in the National Assembly.
  
Watchers of developments in the federal bicameral legislature maintain that right from the contrived defections preceding the 2015 general election, which produced the change of guard at the presidency and national politics, the two main political groupings, APC and PDP, have been engaged in sundry wit games over which party occupies the majority and minority status.  Prejudice, presumptuousness
While Onuoha Bourdex, who is also a member of APGA’s Board of Trustees (BoT), argued that it would be presumptuous and prejudicial to declare Abia North Senatorial seat, occupied by Senator Orji Uzor Kalu vacant, he accused “ambitious politicians of trying to undermine the electoral preferences of the electorate.” The APGA chieftain, who spoke to journalists in Abuja, noted that although the present occupant of the senate seat is facing some challenges, the wishes of the electorate that voted for him should be respected.
  
While citing a recent re-run election in Abia State in which APGA beat two candidates of PDP, the APGA chieftain said the outcome of the election confirmed that PDP did not win the February 28, 2019, National Assembly election.
