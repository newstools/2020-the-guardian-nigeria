One person has been feared killed, several others injured and over six houses razed as Igwo Community in Obudu Council Area of Cross River State yesterday clashed over N500m compensation from the state government over the proposed Cargo Airport. Community sources said the youths went on a rampage and attacked some chiefs and elders suspected to have short changed them in the sharing formula, as they said individuals and groups were offered between N2,000 and N5,000 as compensation. The youths were said to have attacked houses belonging to the chiefs and elders, who The Guardian learned, escaped for safety, but their houses were burnt. Following the incident, an eyewitness in the community confirmed that one woman was killed in the clash, several others injured and some houses burnt, just as it was also learnt that the compensations were not released at once, but in batches. Governor Ben Ayade had recently approved the payment of N500m as compensation for the 1500 hectares of land acquired by the state government for the construction of the proposed Cargo Airport in Obudu. Commissioner for Lands, Professor John Inyang announced the payment of compensation and other benefits recently in his office when he received a delegation of the executives of the community-led by its National President, Roland Ogbonta. Inyang said for acquisition of lands and payment of compensation, Governor Ayade has been paying compensations as and when due. “Since I came on board as Commissioner in Ayade’s first tenure and reappointed for the same position in his second term, we have paid compensations to over eight different communities and corporate bodies,” he said. When contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) Irene Ugbo, confirmed the incident, saying one person died, while the police have arrested five persons in connection with the clash, but that calm has returned to the community.
