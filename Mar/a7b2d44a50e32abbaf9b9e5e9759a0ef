Police officers’ wives fighting insurgents in the northeast, yesterday, in Jos, the Plateau State capital, took to the streets in protest, calling on the federal government to redeploy their husbands from the zone because of their incessant killings. Dressed in black attire, the women lamented that many of their husbands fighting insurgents have been killed by the terrorists without anything being done. One of the protesters said: “Our hearts are troubled. Every day, we are being turned to widows due to the ongoing fight against Boko Haram in the northeast zone because our husbands, who are deployed to the region, are daily being killed by the terrorists without anything being done. The situation is unbearable to us.” Another protester said: “Why are our husbands not redeployed according to the terms of their engagement? Some of them have over-stayed in their places of assignment, yet they just abandon them to their fate, making them easy prey to the terrorists who are better equipped with sophisticated weapons. “Many of them have been killed, with the information kept secret from their families, while those who managed to be alive are not allowed to visit their families for many years. “The federal government should have pity on us and save our husbands from avoidable deaths. That is why we are calling on the government to redeploy them before we all become widows.” Spokesman of the state Police Command, Ubah Gabriel Ogaba, did not respond to calls when contacted for comment over the development.
