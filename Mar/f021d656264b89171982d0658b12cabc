Mundy, 52, began dating Beverly Jackson after meeting at the UK meet-and-greet. But he subjected her to physical abuse, including sinking his teeth in. Mundy returned to the United States but messaged Jackson two years ago to ask if he could sleep in her spare room in Manchester when he was next in the UK. Jackson admitted she fell for Mundy because initially he was “very charming” and he promised to help her get into films. However, he became “more and more abusive”. According to the Sun UK, Jackson, from Liverpool, says she was first attacked by Mundy in a hotel room in Germany in late 2018. She said: “He hit me around the face, bit me on the hands, arm and back, kicked me and threw me out of the room.” Jackson says the abuse got worse and Mundy got a short jail term last November after being convicted of assault and was banned from going near her. Homeless after his release, Mundy was recalled to jail last month for breaching the restraining order. He is due out of HMP Liverpool soon and Beverly Jackson said: “I fear he won’t stop until I’m dead.” The Walking Dead is an American post-apocalyptic horror television series. In the series, a group of survivors led by police officer Rick Grimes travel in search of a safe and secure home after a zombie apocalypse spreads across the United States of America.
