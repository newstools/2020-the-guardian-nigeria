His election as governor of Lagos State in January 1999 was not the first electoral victory of the man who was later to become Asiwaju of Lagos and Jagaban of Borgu Kingdom, Alhaji Bola Ahmed Adekunle Tinubu. Prior to holding that executive office, Tinubu was elected to represent Lagos West Senatorial District in the Senate of the Federal Republic of Nigeria on the platform of Social Democratic Party (SDP). That was during the short-lived Nigeria’s third republic.
  
But it was actually his election as Lagos State governor that paved the way to the manifestation of the sterling leadership qualities that have defined the Tinubu outline in Nigeria politics. At his election, perhaps based on his past political associations and exploits, the new governor appeared very clear-headed and clear-minded about the expectations and challenges of his office.
    
Evidence that His Excellency, the 12th Governor of Lagos State knew what he was elected to do was conveyed in a rich prose in his inaugural address, which he summed up with this outline: “My good people of Lagos State, as the new torch-bearers of hope, we will be required to break ground and brave path, and with your support and cooperation, we shall overcome.”  Foundation For Good Governance
It could be safely argued that it was within Governor Tinubu’s first term in office- the period spanning 1999 through 2003- that the foundation of good governance for which Lagos has become renowned was laid. The essential pillars of the superstructure, including the infrastructure, became noticeable during that period.
  
As he pursued ambitious programmes in Roads, Housing and Education, the governor carried out the much-needed reforms in the civil service, particularly in the area of dispensation of justice. The innovation of Alternative Dispute Resolution, which gained currency in the Lagos State Judicial system, stands out as one of the many torch-bearing initiatives that took root in the Tinubu dispensation.
  
It has been noted by experts that the existence and pre-eminence of the legislature signposts every durable constitutional democracy. Apart from the mutually beneficial close-knit relationship between the Executive and the Legislative arms during Tinubu’s tenure, which could be excused on his legislative experience, the governor brought his understanding of democracy to bear.  Assault On Flawed Electoral Processes
By May 29, 2007, Governor Tinubu served out his second and final term in office as prescribed by the constitution. The experiences he garnered within that preceding eight years were to be his guide in search of an enduring democratic practice in Nigeria.
   
Of remarkable importance is the fact that the attempt to supplant his mandate in 2003 and inferences from the globally acknowledged flaws in the 2007 election combined to motivate Tinubu to support the search for electoral reforms in the country.
   
All indicators pointed to the possibility that there was a clever attempt to obviate democracy in the country, because the 2007 General Elections exposed the keenness and sheer braggadocio of the ruling elite in the perpetration of electoral malfeasance. Compromise of electronic components, defalcation of records and manipulation of processes to generate false results became commonplace.  Change, Of Focus/Leadership
EIGHT years after he left office as governor, Tinubu succeeded in pulling off a historical brace: The merger of political parties happened, the mega party, named All Progressives Congress (APC), succeeded in dethroning the almighty PDP from the zenith of political power after 16 years of the country’s democracy.  
   
To this day, students of political history are astounded by the Nigerian example, how the vision of one man was able to alter the political behaviours and idiosyncrasies of the people. A combination of ideological messaging and sloganeering helped to destabilize the former ruling party.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
