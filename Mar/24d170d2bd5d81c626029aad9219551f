There are strong indications that the suspected mastermind and leader of the gang terrorising Satellite town and environs in Lagos State have resurfaced few days after he fled their criminal den following a sustained operation by the police in the area. The alleged mastermind said to lay claim to the leadership of Oguntade community in Satellite town reportedly returned few days after a team of policemen stormed his notorious enclave but failed to arrest him and his cohorts. As at press time, the police had not intervened while victims are living in constant fear.
