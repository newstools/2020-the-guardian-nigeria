Although security officials have not said what caused the huge explosion, which cut off a section of Akure-Owo Expressway, eyewitnesses said it was likely that explosives being transported through the area detonated unexpectedly. The blast destroyed Possibility Church, a popular church located less than a kilometer to Akure Airport. A school, Aina Awawu International College, nearby was also damaged. Ondo State governor Rotimi Akeredolu confirmed the incident on Twitter. “I’ve been briefed by security agencies in the state concerning the loud blast that was heard,” Akeredolu said. “I will be at the scene to assess on the advice of heads of our security agencies.” The incident has left many vehicles stranded on the expressway and the scene cordoned off by the police.
