A bag of soybeans now goes for N8,000 as against the previous price of N13,200. The Chairman, Perishable Sellers Association in the market, Alhaji Musa Zugo, said that the crash was due to the lockdown which had prevented customers from going to the market. “Majority of our customers from Lagos, Ogun, Abuja and Port Harcourt are no longer coming because of the lockdown in the country. “Very few customers come to the market and you know, if demand drops, the price also drops,” he said. Zugo, however, appealed to the federal government to assist in cushioning the effect of the lockdown on the poor and the vulnerable in the country. “The federal government need to come up with a strategy to assist the people at the lower cadre of the society who rely on daily earnings to survive. “If you keep this category of people at home with nothing to fall back on, they will die of hunger,” he said.
