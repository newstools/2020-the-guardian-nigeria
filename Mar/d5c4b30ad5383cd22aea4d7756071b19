Kano state lawmakers broke out in a rowdy session on Monday over the removal emir of Kano Muhammadu Sanusi II. The mild drama started when the deputy speaker of the house, Hamisu Ibrahim Chidere moved a motion to discuss an issue relating to an investigation of the emir. In a counter objection, member representing Dala constituency Lawan Hussaini vehemently kicked against the deputy speaker’s motion, insisting the matter was not on the list of proceedings. The matter got to a head when the speaker said the House would discuss the motion on Emir Sanusi. The move by the speaker polarised the assembly along party lines as All Progressives Congress’s lawmakers favoured the speaker’s decision. But the People’s Democratic Party lawmakers revolted. The development which led to an altercation between the lawmakers forced the speaker to suspend plenary for 30 minutes. The house on Wednesday last week set of investigation panel led by the deputy speaker, Hamisu Ibrahim to investigate petition submitted against the embattled emir. The petitioners had claimed the emir committed acts detrimental to culture and tradition of Kano. Although a lawmaker representing Dala constituency, Lawan Hussain kicked against the move and insisted that the petitioners should physically appear before the house, the speaker, however, overruled him.
