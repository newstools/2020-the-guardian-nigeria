With the groundswell of opposition against Governor Willie Obiano’s overt plans to enthrone his preferred candidate as successor, Anambra State may end up as another case where an incumbent’s succession plot crumbled.
  
Recently, former Bayelsa State governor, Henry Seriake Dickson escaped by the whiskers from following in the steps of Ayodele Fayose, Olusegun Mimiko, Ibikunle Amosun, Abiola Ajimobi, Ibrahim Dankwambo, Rochas Okorocha, as states whose chief executives failed in recent history to impose their successors.
  
Like Dickson, Mimiko and Fayose, Obiano is the next on the line of governors whose states fall within the subset of offseason gubernatorial polls. And from the look of things, the storms have started gathering, indicative of a very stiff contest among the contending political interests.  Anambra Elders’ Input
RECENTLY Anambra State Elders Council decided to jump into the ongoing schemes on how to help the governor prosecute his succession plan. Working ostensibly to support Governor Obiano’s agenda of fielding Soludo, the elders declared that the next governor of the state should come from Anambra South Senatorial District.  Lawmakers’ Nay Signal
In what seemed as further signs of tough choice for Governor Obiano, members of the state House of Assembly did not honour a symposium his administration planned to showcase its achievements in the past six years.
  
The legislators of the state’s Seventh plenary were said to have displayed their misgivings towards the governor’s style recently when they rebuffed overtures to endorse the governor’s achievements in his second year into the second term in office.
