Tackles president over coronavirus pandemic The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) yesterday rose from a meeting condemning President Muhammadu Buhari for ‘collapsing’ the nation’s economy. At a press conference addressed by its National Chairman, Uche Secondus, the main opposition party contended that the president had not “demonstrated serious capacity and competence in dealing with critical issues arising from the Coronavirus pandemic.” It stated: “No segment of our nationhood is in good shape as we speak. “The economy is in a dire state as the country heads towards insolvency, occasioned by huge unserviceable debts and the crash of oil price.” On security, the PDP lamented that “Nigerians have continued to live in fears, as the security situation worsens and remains unabated.” It decried the “worsening unemployment situation” in the land, adding that “the root causes of the problems facing the nation, particularly the violence and crimes across the country, are poverty, hunger, illiteracy, economic and political deprivations arising from unemployment.” “Until these fundamentals are resolved, the country will continue to experience violence, crimes and remain in complete state of insecurity, as no amount of police or military action can prevent or even curb the menace. “The Federal Government must devise a concrete means of seeking a lasting solution by working with critical stakeholders, particularly the states, local government areas and communities,” the party added. The PDP also decried what it called the “display of gross insensitivity in the exclusion of the whole Southeast zone and Edo State from the benefits of the whooping $22 billion loan request.” On the handling of the novel disease outbreak, the political grouping noted:  “The Coronavirus ravaging the world has thrown up fresh challenges across the globe for leaders of nations. While we watch and admire leaders rise to the challenge elsewhere, the reverse is the case in our country. Nigerians are yet to hear or see their president rise to the emergency and those officers on duty have not enjoyed the needed political will.” “Also very outstanding is the Nigerian government’s response to disaster as was experienced in weekend’s pipeline explosion in Lagos State.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
