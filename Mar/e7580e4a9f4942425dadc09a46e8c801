The management of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) has denied claims that it planned using some funds meant for corp members’ February allowance to tackle coronavirus. “The attention of the Management of the National Youth Service Corps has been drawn to an announcement, purported to have been issued by the NYSC Director-General to the effect that the February allowance of Corps Members had been channelled towards the fight against Coronavirus,” NYSC said in a statement. “Every discerning mind knows that the press release is not true, and can never be issued by the NYSC Director-General.” Days after Nigeria confirmed its first case of coronavirus in Lagos State, some social media posts claimed that the government plan to use some parts of allowance meant for corp members to set up preventive measures for their safety. The social media posts did not provide any proof to authenticate the claims. NYSC management said the sponsors of the rumour spreading on social media were mischievous in their plans to leverage on a global issue like “Coronavirus which represents a threat to humanity.” It warned sponsors of the social media posts to desist or risk being prosecuted. NYSC said the Federal Government accords top priority to the welfare and safety of corps members. While urging Corps Members to “disregard the ill-conceived post, Management strongly admonishes mischief makers to desist from generating and circulating false stories on the Scheme.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
