The Nigerian military said over 100 Boko Haram terrorists were neutralised at a clearance operation in Gorgi, not 500 or 200, as given, respectively, by secondary sources. The military explained that the updated figure contradicts the number of Boko Haram casualties given at its initial media briefing. Coordinator of the Directorate of Defence Media Operations (DDMO), Maj-Gen. John Enenche, who gave the clarification in a statement issued to newsmen yesterday, said the over 100 insurgents were neutralised as a result of direct fire action and encounter with gallant troops during the clearance of Gorgi between March 21 and 23. He stated: “Following the encounter between the Armed Forces of Nigeria and insurgents in Operation Lafiya Dole at Gorgi… a team was sent to carry out the due operational after-action procedure, which includes reconfirmation of casualties and immediate medical evacuation required among others.” On the findings after the exercise, the DDMO coordinator said: “The team made the following findings: 29 Nigerian troops were killed and 39 were wounded in action as a result of the explosion of the truck carrying logistics and ammunition resupply for the fighting echelon. “This is contrary to the figures from the first conduct situation report of 47 killed and 15 wounded in action.” Enenche, who added that troops of Operation Lafiya Dole (ODL) successfully cleared Gorgi and also dealt a heavy blow on the enemies of the state, assured that the armed forces remain committed to decisively tackling insecurity in the country.
