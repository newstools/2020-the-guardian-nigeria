The immediate past president of the Court of Appeal, Justice Zainab Bulkachuwa, has called for the promotion of the welfare of judges for optimal performance.
   
Bulkachuwa said an effective and reliable judicial system demands a suitable system for the welfare of judges.
   
According to her, no institution can afford to overlook the aspect of welfare and training with regards to its members of staff. 
   
There has been a continuous emphasis on these points in Nigeria’s Court of Appeal, she noted, expressing the optimism that a day will come when those challenges would be overcame. She spoke during the public presentation of a book tittled: ‘Court of Appeal: 40 years and Counting’ at a conference of the Court of Appeal justices in Abuja.
