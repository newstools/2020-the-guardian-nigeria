Persons with Disabilities (PWDs) have appealed to the Federal Government to involve its members in the provision of toilets and other sanitation facilities so that they are not left behind. Chairman, Joint National Association of Persons with Disabilities (JONAPWD), Suleiman Ugah made the appeal in Abuja during the launch of the Accelerated Access to Rural Sanitation in Nigeria (AATRISAN) organised by Toilet Pride. Suleiman said: “it is important for the government to involve people with disabilities at every level of decision making on issues that affect them such as Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) facilities. “Toilets across Nigeria are usually not friendly to PWDs. Toilets doors are narrow such that persons using wheelchairs find it impossible to pass through, also, many other sanitation considerations are not taken with respect to considering PWDs.” Minister of Water Resources, Suleiman Adamu, said access to water and sanitation services is one of the key indices for measuring countries’ development. That is why the Nigerian government is paying special attention to the sector and would also consider PWDs.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
