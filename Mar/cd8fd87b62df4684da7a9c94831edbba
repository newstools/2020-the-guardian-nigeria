The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has begun in-house moves to forestall heightened intra-party crisis that could jeopardise its chances in 2023. Consequently, it has indicated readiness to sanction some prominent members, alleged to have engaged in membership registration, thereby breaching the party’s Constitution. In many states, some prominent leaders were said to have engaged in the exercise, having discovered that the profile of party membership in their states or constituencies did not favour their political interest. A PDP national officer said: “Usually, before congresses begin, we carry out membership registration, which closes a few weeks before actual congresses take off. What happened is that, when some people discovered that those who may have registered in their areas might not be their supporters, they began another registration, not ordered by the party. “As it is, those illegal registrations stand cancelled.

The party has, therefore, directed its state chairmen “to take firm control and maintain strict supervision of our party’s membership, issuance of valid membership cards, and ward registers. All membership cards, whose origin cannot be established/verified are therefore suspected to be forged…”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
