While the coronavirus ravages through Nigeria, reports have it that the Nigerian House of Representatives has begun taking stock of 400 newly acquired Toyota Camry 2020 models. With the number of confirmed cases of the virus increasing by the day, many Nigerians have expressed their annoyance to the fact that the country has poorly equipped hospitals and the growing need for more ventilators. But a member of the House of Representatives Akin Alabi said on Twitter that the cars were delivered months ago. As of March 26th,  the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) reported 14 new cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Nigeria: 1 in FCT, 1 in Bauchi and 12 in Lagos making it a total of 65 cases with 3 discharged and 1 death.

Wicked human beings!! — Odyloveth (@odyloveth) March 27, 2020  While the Reps are taking delivery of 400 brand new Toyota Camry 2020, worth $25,000+ each. The govt is finding it difficult to purchase ventilators at $17,000 each. Same govt is relying on donated  #COVIDー19test kits from China. The tragedy of a Nation. — Young Otutu (@YoungOtutu) March 27, 2020  In other news, the @HouseNGR have started taking delivery of the Toyota Camry 2020 model cars acquired for members as official cars.
