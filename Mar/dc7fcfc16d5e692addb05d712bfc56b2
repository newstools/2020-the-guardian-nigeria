In what seem like a lifeline for Nigerian filmmakers seeking avenues to sell their contents, Netflix has announced its presence in Nigeria. The streaming giant, which had been procuring Nigerian content throughout much of last year, after acquiring Genevieve Nnaji’s Lionheart in 2018, has announced the arrival of Netflix Naija with a new Twitter account. “N is for Naija. N is for Nollywood,” read the account’s announcement tweet. “N is the 14th alphabet. 14 is also how many great talents you’re looking at. N is for Netflix. But most importantly…hello, Nigeria!” The tweet was shared along with a photo of some of the Nigerian film industry’s most notable actors and filmmakers, including Banky W, Adesua Etomi, Kunle Folayan, Kemi Adetiba, Omoni Oboli as well as veteran actors Ramsey Nouah and Richard Mofe-Damijo and several others. According to sources, Netflix is currently developing two unnamed original series from Nigeria as well. Details about one of the series were shared at an event following the launch on Monday. One of the shows will be a six-part series “set in modern-day Nigeria and shot in Lagos.” “This drama tells the story of Kemi, a goddess reincarnated as a human to avenge her sister’s death,” reads the series’ press statement. The show is from Nigerian filmmaker Akin Omotosho and is inspired by her childhood. The cast includes Kate Henshaw and Ade Laoye, Ireti Doyle, Richard Mofe-Damijo, Joke Silva, Bimbo Akintola, and Kehinde Bankole. While details around the shows and the launch of Netflix Naija still remain mostly under wraps, many have responded with excitement about what’s to come. What this means is that more local contents from Nigeria would find their way on the Netflix platform.
