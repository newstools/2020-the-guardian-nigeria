While inaugurating the committee at the Government House, Maiduguri, Zulum said, “The Military’s ban followed allegations that Boko Haram uses fish proceeds to finance its activities in Borno State and neighbouring states of Adamawa and Yobe.” While responding to the task, Chairman of committee, Kaka Shehu Lawan, who is the Borno State Attorney General and Commissioner of Justice, commended the governor for finding them worthy to carry out the investigation.
