Director General/Chief Executive Officer of the National Biosafety Management Agency (NBMA), Dr. Rufus Ebegba has promised to ensure that the agency is strategically positioned for the safety of human beings and the environment. Ebegba disclosed this during the visit of new Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Environment, Dr. Bakari Wadinga to the agency’s office in Abuja. He said the agency has been working in accordance with its mandate of ensuring safety of humans and the environment in the transfer and application of modern Biotechnology and its products. He said: “The NBMA, through the Act, has been mandated to provide regulatory framework to adequately safeguard human health and the environment from potential adverse effects of modern biotechnology and Genetically Modified Organisms, while harnessing the potentials of modern biotechnology and its derivatives, for the benefit of Nigerians. “We are working closely with other stakeholders and line ministries, departments and Agency to ensure that our mandate is achieved and only safe products are deployed for humans and the environment.” Ebegba said the act was amended and this has expanded the scope of the NBMA to include Biosecurity and the regulation of new and emerging technologies. “With the inclusion of new areas of regulation, the mandate of the NBMA has further been expanded and this has led to the creation of the Biosecurity department, which ensures the security of Biological Agents so that they do not cause harm to humans and the environment.” In his response, the Permanent secretary, Wadinga who commended the DG/CEO, said there is need for the NBMA to make deliberate efforts to boost its revenue generation. “The agency has the potential to do more than regulation and I want to urge you to take advantage of your position as regulator to embark on sustainable research for the benefit of Nigerians,” he said.
