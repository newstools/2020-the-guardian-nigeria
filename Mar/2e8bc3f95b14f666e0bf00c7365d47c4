Jos Imam urges prayers to overcome disease
General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), Pastor Enoch Adeboye, has said God is using Coronavirus to show His power to the world and draw their attention unto Him. This was part of his Sunday message broadcast live through several platforms globally, in which he assured that those who are truly in Christ Jesus were assured of safety in the midst of the pestilence. Adeboye, who cited Psalm 91:1-10 in his sermon, reminded the congregation of one of his prophecies at the beginning of the year in which he stated that God told him that in 2020, the whole world would behave like a convulsing child. He said the coronavirus contagion was of the Lord and that it could only subside, but not go away completely, adding, “When God revealed that this year the whole world would behave like a convulsing child, He also added that the whole world would be on compulsory holiday. “Today, all of you can see that holidays are being declared across the world even among powerful nations.”He recalled the message God gave him that RCCG members should fast for 50 days at the beginning of the year, saying the fasting was to guarantee members of safety in God during the pestilence. “God is using coronavirus to show the world that He is still in control of the affairs of men. This is a public holiday declared from heaven,” he added. Meanwhile, Chief Imam of Jos Central Mosque, Sheikh Lawal Adam, has urged Christians and Muslims to turn to God genuinely in prayers to enable them to overcome coronavirus and its consequences globally. Adam made the call during the Juma’at prayers at the Jos Central Mosque where thousands of Muslim faithful gathered to pray for Allah’s mercies on Nigeria and other countries to overcome the scourge. He also admonished the gathering to always forgive one another, as Allah would be happy to see people living in peace, urging Muslims to sustain prayers to Allah to help them to overcome Nigerians to overcome all the challenges facing the country. Management Committee Chairman of Jos North Council Area, Shehu Bala Usman, said his administration was committed to creating awareness with a view to preventing the disease in the state. Usman commended the state and federal governments for measures put in place to address the issues of coronavirus.Also, Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Professor Danladi Atu, said government had put measures in place to mitigate the spread of the disease, noting, “Worship places, motor parks, hotels, markets and super markets should maintain two metres spacing and provide running water, soap and sanitisers at their entrances.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
