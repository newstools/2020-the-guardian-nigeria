The Lagos State Government on Saturday suspended its earlier decision to close Marine Bridge for five months for repair, following the swelling cases of COVID-19 in the state. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) recalls that the Public Affairs Unit of the State Ministry of Transportation (MOT) had on Friday announced the closing down of the Marine Bridge, partially between 8.00p.m and 8.00a.m daily from March 28 to Aug. 15 for repair. The statement said that the closure would allow the construction works by the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing to replace the worn-out Elastomeric Bearing, and Expand the Metallic joints on the bridge. It said that the repair works, meant to take duration of 20 weeks, would be done in two phases of 10 weeks each to ease traffic movements. Announcing suspension of the bridge closure on Saturday in a statement, Dr Frederic Oladeinde, the State Commissioner for Transportation, said that the repair work would be suspended until further notice Oladeinde said that the decision was based on the focus of the state to tackle the Coronavirus pandemic. According to him, the suspension has also become imperative because of the need to evoke the social distancing strategy, especially in the construction sector, to further curb the spread of the virus. The commissioner said: “A new date for the planned repair works of the bridge shall be communicated in due course. “Lagos State Government is, however, advising Lagosians to still stay at home and practice social distancing, unless the trip is really essential.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
