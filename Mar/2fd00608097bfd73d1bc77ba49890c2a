Shops will be open exclusively for those aged over 65 between 9 am and 12 noon to “separate youth from elderly in a bearable way,” said Orban. The move is the latest in a series of government decrees including school closures introduced after a state of emergency was announced March 11. Hungary closed its borders to non-nationals from March 17, which led to chaos for travellers and freight hauliers at border crossings and Budapest airport. Parliament is set Tuesday to grant Orban sweeping powers of the decree until the government declares an end to the state of emergency. Hungary, which has a population of almost 10 million, has so far recorded 300 infections from the virus and 10 deaths.
