Former Super Eagles’ Captain, Henry Nwosu has urged the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) to clarify its stance on the senior national team manager, Gernot Rohr, saying leaving the German in the lurch could harm the team. Recently, Rohr tweeted that he was still waiting for the NFF to decide on his future with the Eagles, adding that was everything was dependent on the federation. Nwosu told The Guardian on Tuesday that the NFF should either renew Rohr’s contract or let him go, adding that the national team coach should be by now finalizing his team for the African Nations Cup and World Cup qualifiers. “It is dangerous for the NFF to continue dragging the issue of the renewal of Rohr’s contract. “We don’t know when the Coronavirus scare will end… but if it ends in June and the NFF has still not resolved the Rohr issue, he might dumb the national team and move on. This might affect the Eagles’ build up for the qualifiers. “I believe Rohr has done a good job with the Eagles and they should allow him to continue. But if the NFF doesn’t want to review his contract, then they should move for another coach while there is still time,” he said. The NFF engaged the German coach in August 2016 on a two-year contract, which was renewed in January 2018 ahead of the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia. The current contract will expire in June. There are speculations that the German may not handle the team when the AFCON qualifiers resume with a doubleheader against Sierra Leone. The NFF, however, said recently that their lawyers are preparing a new contract for Rohr, with some conditions attached to make for a more disciplined team.
