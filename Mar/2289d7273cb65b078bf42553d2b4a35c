The Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the Governing All Progressives Congress (APC), Mr. Yekini Nabena, said that he had taken over the office of Malam Lanre Issa-Onilu in acting capacity in deference to a Sokoto High Court order. A Sokoto High Court had last week restrained the party from appointing or electing “Malam Lanre Issa-Onilu or any member” into its top positions except through a national convention. In a statement made available to The Guardian, Nabena said he would play Onilu’s role pending resolution of the matter. The Bayelsa State-born politician, however, sought understanding among the APC supporters worldwide even as he urged the media and other stakeholders to co-operate with him in carrying out the assignment as usual. According to him: “APC is a law abiding party and as leaders of the party, we must be seen doing the right thing at all time, including respecting the order of the court. In lieu of this, Malam Onilu has begun the process of vacating the order of the Sokoto High Court restraining him but pending the time this will be done, I will act in his position. “Unlike the former ruling party, APC has high regard for the judiciary and we must be seen at all time practising what we preach.” Meanwhile, Onilu in his reaction, said there was no any such court judgment restraining him from exercising his power as publicity secretary of the party, adding that Nabena was chasing shadow.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
