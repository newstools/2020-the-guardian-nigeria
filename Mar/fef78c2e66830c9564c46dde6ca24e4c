A fourteen-year-old girl hanged her one-year-old son because she wanted to spend time with her friends according to The Daily Mail. The teenager, Arisa Udsanee, had left the baby with her parents who were angry when she returned home late in Bueng Kan, northeast Thailand last Sunday afternoon. Angrily, she reportedly took the infant, Thanapat Udsanee, to the home of a neighbour, Charinthip Nuengsit, 21, and asked for a place to stay. The neighbour allowed them to stay in a cabin in her back yard. Later that night a motorcycle came to the cabin to pick up Arisa and she told Charinthip that the boy was leaving with her. However, on Wednesday morning Charinthip checked the cabin and found a dead baby hidden under a pram and covered in ants. Paramedics believed the boy had been dead for at least two days. Officers later arrested the boy’s mother and made her do a crime reconstruction, using a Winnie The Pooh bear to show how she allegedly hanged the boy then concealed the body. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-1133715 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/26481386-8159721-image-a-44_1585308738646.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="721" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/26481386-8159721-image-a-44_1585308738646.jpg 634w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/26481386-8159721-image-a-44_1585308738646-640x360.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/26481386-8159721-image-a-44_1585308738646-320x180.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/26481386-8159721-image-a-44_1585308738646-281x158.jpg 281w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/26481386-8159721-image-a-44_1585308738646-562x316.jpg 562w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/26481386-8159721-image-a-44_1585308738646-531x299.jpg 531w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/26481386-8159721-image-a-44_1585308738646-1062x598.jpg 1062w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/26481386-8159721-image-a-44_1585308738646-487x274.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/26481386-8159721-image-a-44_1585308738646-600x338.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> Arisa allegedly admitted killing her son as she was angry at her own parents for scolding her for staying out late. She said she resented the infant for preventing her from spending time with her own friends. Police Major Chanchai Poolonkaew said her crime was serious and she must be punished. In his word: The girl murdered her son so she will have to spend time in prison for 15 to 20 years. It’s not possible to stop that now. The legal process has started. She has admitted the crime and will go to jail.
