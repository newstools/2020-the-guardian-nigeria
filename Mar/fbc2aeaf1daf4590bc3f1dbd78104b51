Poor improvement in almost all benchmarks or precepts used in measuring performance in the oil and gas sector has been attributed to the lack of transparency and weak fiscal intervention by regulators.
   
According to the Nigerian Nation Resource Charter (NNRC), Nigeria lags in proper use of oil and gas earnings, even as trust between the citizens and the governed appears to be non-existent.
   
Discussing the NNRC’s 2019 benchmark report recently launched in Abuja, and unveiled in Lagos, yesterday, Programme Coordinator for NNRC, Tengi George-Ikoli, said the non-passage of the Petroleum Industry Governance Bill (PIGB), remained a major setback to the efficient management of the nation’s resources.  However, George-Ikoli said these targets would only be attainable if Nigeria’s petroleum wealth is managed appropriately.
   
“Diversification, hailed as the saviour for Nigeria’s economy can only be achieved by using Nigeria’s resource wealth to fund diversification efforts as done by Dubai, Norway, Saudi Arabia and other resource rich economies.
 
“Oil remains the driver and the lever needed to lift the larger percentage of Nigerians out of poverty as whatever happens within the petroleum sector directly or indirectly affects every other government policy direction and implementation,” she said.
