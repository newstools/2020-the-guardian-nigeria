Jelani Aliyu, who is now Director-General of the National Automatic Design and Development Council. ”Malam Jelani designed the General Motors of America’s leading auto brand, the Chevrolet Volt. “Now he is assuring Nigerians that all the cars that took part in Argungu Motor Rally were assembled in Nigeria,” he said. In his remarks, the Minister of Science and Technology, Dr Ogbonnaya Onu thanked the President for the many efforts in promoting STI, including maling the sector at the centre of all economic activities under the Economic Recovery and  Growth Plan (ERGP) 2017-2020. The Minister said in the last six months of the second term of President Buhari, the STI sector had helped to create over 900,000 jobs. He added that data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) had shown that Nigeria saved over N1 trillion in the importation of raw materials in both 2017 and 2018. ”The data for 2019 is yet to be released. Patents from scientists and engineers, who passed through the National Office for Technology Acquisition and Promotion (NOTAP), an agency under the supervision of the Federal Ministry of Science and Technology, have continued to increase. ”In 2015, the first year of the Buhari administration, it was only six. In 2016; it was 16, 50 in 2017, 55 in 2018 and 57 in 2019,” he said. As the Covid-19 crisis spreads across the globe, Onu declared that, “what is happening around the world is a wake-up call to intensify efforts to manufacture goods locally and patronize made-in-Nigeria products. ”The Presidential Executive Order No. 5 and the National Strategy for Competitiveness in Raw Materials and Product Development in the country already passed by the Federal Executive Council will help in realizing this noble objective.’’  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
