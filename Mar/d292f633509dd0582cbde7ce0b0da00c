The implementation of the new pump price may be slow, as new pricing templates are expected every month, under the new price modulation strategy deployed by the Federal Government.
  
While petrol marketers await the issuance of credit notes to hedge the cost they would incur by adjusting the pump price from N145 to N125 per litre, oil marketers under the aegis of Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria (MOMAN) and Depot and Petroleum Products Marketers Association of Nigeria (DAPPMAN) have reached an agreement with the managements of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), and the Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency (PPPRA) to begin importation of fuel and to await credit notes from PPPRA before adjusting pump price for petrol to the new N125 per litre.
  
NNPC’s Spokesman, Dr. Kennie Obateru, yesterday, confirmed the importation agreement. Chairman of MOMAN, Tunji Oyebanji, had said that his members cannot sell at the new price except when issues around margins, importation and steps on the sustainability of the downstream are discussed and straightened out.
  
After the meeting, the operators resolved that “the industry stakeholders have received communication on the changes to ex-coastal and ex-depot prices and subsequently engaged the Group Managing Director of NNPC with a resolution to await the decision of the PPPRA Board meeting holding on March 20, 2020, on the new PMS template for price modulation.
  
“The industry stakeholders declared support for the opportunity given to private sector players to resume importation of PMS.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
