Ikeja Electricity Consumers, under the umbrella of Joint Action Congress (JAC) have issued a stern warning to the Ikeja Electric Distribution Company (IE), to stop its planned 50 per cent tariff increase or face the wrath of consumers. According to its Chairman, Apostle Ayodele Olawoye, tariff increase shouldn’t be the priority of the Disco, as they have failed to deliver, especially on even distribution of prepaid meters, among other things. The consumers, who stormed the Public Consultation on Extraordinary Tariff Review of the IE, held in Lagos, with placards of different inscriptions, accused the electricity company of extorting consumers. Olawoye said: “Only a few people are metered. They still have more than 50 per cent of customers to meter. Today, what we want from them is that they should meter their customers first before tariff increase and the meter at the transformer should be removed.” Another protester, Ajayi Olurombi, who described IE inconsistency, recounted how the Disco has been unfaithful in the distribution of the prepaid meters. “Even if it was supposed to be free, people that paid for it have yet to receive the meters. Meanwhile, exorbitant bills with irregular increases are what they heap on electricity consumers, who are yet to get the meters. It is simply disheartening,” he said. However, the IE said since the official takeover of the company, more than 250,000 customers have been metered and the power supply gap has been said to experience more than 50 per cent increase over the years. During the questions and answer sessions, the Chief Financial Officer, Olubunmi Olukoju, shed more light on the tariff increase and how relevant it is to aid the delivery of utmost value to their customers and the nation as a whole.
