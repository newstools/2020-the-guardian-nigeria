Timi Dakolo is back again with another beautiful song titled “Take”. On this one, he comes through with a new love song featuring YBNL boss, Olamide and his lovely wife Busola. Take was produced by Pheelz and directed by Frizzle & Bizzle. Listen below.  Earlier in November, Dakolo inked an international deal with Virgin EMI Records and released his title track “Merry Christmas Darling”, featuring award-winning British singer, Emeli Sande. The Christmas themed song is the first track off his highly anticipated sophomore album. Dakolo also released the Christmas-inspired album in November 2019 which, of course, was an early gift to his fans.
