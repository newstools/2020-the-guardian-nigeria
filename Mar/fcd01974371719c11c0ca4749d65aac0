(Photo by Pau Barrena / AFP)  Spain is the fourth worst-hit country in the world after China, Italy and Iran, with numbers rising rapidly despite an unprecedented national lockdown, with the government ordering its 46 million population to stay home. Over the past 24 hours, the number of people infected rose by 1,987, hiking the overall total to 11,178, the ministry’s emergencies coordinator Fernando Simon said. At the same time, the number of people who had recovered from the virus stood at 1,098, he said. But an update released by the ministry shortly afterwards revised down the figure to 1,028, giving a recovery rate of just over 9 percent. Madrid is by far the worst-hit area, accounting for 4,871 cases, or 43 percent of the total infections in Spain. It has also counted 355 deaths, fully 72.3 percent of the total number who have died in Spain since the start of the epidemic.
