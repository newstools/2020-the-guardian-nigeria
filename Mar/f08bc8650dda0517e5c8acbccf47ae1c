The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame inductee revealed to Rolling Stone that he tested for coronavirus after having a small cough and temperature. “As soon as I had a small cough and a temperature, I tested [for COVID-19].” Brown, however, assures his fans that there is no cause for alarm as his symptoms aren’t severe. “My symptoms are really pretty mild, so I don’t require any kind of medication and certainly not hospitalization or anything like that.” The 71-year-old isn’t sure where he got it, but he suspected his recent trip to New York for the annual Love Rocks NYC benefit, which also featured Cyndi Lauper, Dave Matthews, Warren Haynes, Susan Tedeschi, and Derek Trucks, may have been the source. Jackson Browne stressed that people should take part in the global effort to curb the spread as they might have it and not show symtops. “So many people that have it aren’t going to be tested. They don’t have symptoms, but they might have it and might be able to pass it on. That’s what younger readers need to understand: They need to take part in the global response to stop the spread. That means not going anywhere, not getting into contact with anybody, not seeing anybody.” Jackson Browne whose birth name is Clyde Jackson Browne was born on October 9, 1948. He came to prominence in the 1970s and has sold over 18 million albums in the United States. Browne has written and recorded songs such as “These Days”, “The Pretender”, “Running on Empty”, “Lawyers in Love”, “Doctor My Eyes”, “Take It Easy”, “For a Rocker”, and “Somebody’s Baby”. In 2015, Rolling Stone ranked him as 37th in its list of the “100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time”
