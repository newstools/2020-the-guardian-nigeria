Sequel to the repeated calls by World Health Organisation (WHO) to maintain social distancing in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, Sterling Bank is offering access to quality healthcare service through digital channels for a period of 90 days. The bank stated that the service is part of its social intervention plans, aimed at cushioning the effects of the Covid-19 and keep people safe at this critical period. In a chat with The Guardian, Divisional Head, Health and Education Sectors, Sterling Bank PLC, Mr. Obinna Ukachukwu, said the health sector is one of the five areas that the bank has invested in. The other sectors, he added, are education, agriculture, renewable energy and transportation. Ukachukwu said the bankâ€™s intervention is to help Nigerians maintain social distancing, noting that the provision allows remote access to healthcare diagnosis, consultation, and subsequently advice and recommendations. Ukachukwu said its customers automatically qualify for this free medicare, and even those who do not bank with them.
