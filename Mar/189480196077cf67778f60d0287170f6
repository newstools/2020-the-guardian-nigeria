• Police arrest 1,182 suspects in Lagos, parade 98 suspects in FCT It was a harvest of criminals nabbed for various offences across the country as many police commands and formations paraded suspects of nefarious crimes. In Ondo State, a farmer and father of two, Sule Shaye Idris, was arrested with a burnt human head and two hands, saying he helped his brother-in-law to dismember the body. Idris, who hails from Kogi State, was paraded yesterday at the command headquarters, Akure, alongside other nine suspects, who were arrested for offences varying from armed robbery, kidnapping, piracy, murder to cultism. The police command in Akwa Ibom State has arrested one Lucky Michael, who murdered an 82-year-old Cecilia Isong from Oku Abak in her farm for suspected ritual purposes. Parading the suspect, the Commissioner of Police, Imohimi Edgal, commended the youths of Oku Abak, who collaborated with the police in the area to arrest the suspect. A woman identified as ‘Eka Sammy’ was beheaded in her farm. The suspect said that a prophetess contracted him for a fee of N150,000 to bring human head for rituals. However, the suspect refused to mention the name of the prophetess. Also, a child trafficking and fake pregnancy syndicate that specialized in injecting women with substances to swell their womb with fake pregnancy was busted. Edgal explained that the fake pregnancy victim, Mrs. Stella Edet, paid N800,000 to a traditional birth attendant, Comfort Effiong, to enable her nurture the pregnancy only for her to be given a one
week old baby delivered by another woman. “Stella Francis Edet, aged 26, said she went to Sapodic Clinic, Ukanafun in 2018 where one Dr. Saturday Aaron gave her injection for pregnancy, which caused her womb to swell-up. When she was due for delivery, the traditional birth attendant gave her an injection on her lap to prevent her from feeling pains, and thereafter told her to lie on the floor. “After a while, she noticed that the birth attendant covered her face with wrapper, used razor to cut her pelvis, and thereafter brought a baby claiming that she delivered the baby. She raised alarm that she was not the mother of the child and fight ensued between both of them. On the basis of investigation, operatives proceeded to Ukanafun where Dr. Aaron was arrested, along with his two staff and recovered substances suspected to be concoction used in administering to women for false pregnancy”, he said. The Lagos State police command has arrested no fewer 1,182 persons for various crimes committed within the metropolis in the last 119 days. Among those arrested are 164 suspects who were nabbed for robbery and13 suspected armed robbers who were killed in different gun battles with the police. The Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu, said the command also recorded 10 cases of suicide and successfully prevented seven persons from committing suicide.

He said a Volkswagen golf car laden with a cache of arms and ammunition, was intercepted while in transit for supply to bandits operating in neighbouring states. He stated that the car was intercepted by police operatives who became suspicious of the driver’s recklessness when he was flagged down, which prompted them to trail him to a point where he abandoned the car and fled.
