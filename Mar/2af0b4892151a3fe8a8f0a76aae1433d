Ganduje Governor Abdullahi Ganduje has directed the immediate closure of all event and recreation centres to curtail the spread of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19). He has also restricted social and public gatherings that populated more that 20 people. Ganduje gave the order at a live state broadcast over the ravaging COVID-19 across the globe. The government had earlier directed immediate shutdown of local Quranic and Islamiyya centres in the state and suspension of academic activities in schools. “As part of the proactive measures against Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19), the Kano State government has suspended official engagements and ordered the state’s Ministry of Tourism and Culture to call the owners of all event centres in the state to suspend all activities till further notice,” he said. Ganduje reminded that while order palliative measures were being initiated, emergency preparedness and response sub-committees had also been constituted in all the 44 councils and 484 wards in the state, besides the transport unions’ efforts in making proper arrangement in the motor parks. “Our traditional and religious leaders are part of the major stakeholders in this collective effort. Hence it is very important for them to properly regulate all worship centres as proactive measures against Covid-19. “While these measures are being instituted, other measures have been taken. We have established a high-powered taskforce under the leadership of the deputy governor, Dr. Nasiru Gawuna. This is done to mobilise all available resources and closely co-ordinate all response activities towards curtailing the spread of the disease and safeguarding the health of our teaming population. Isolation centre for management of cases has been designated.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
