The Lagos State Commissioner for Tourism, Arts and Culture, Mrs. Uzamat Akinbile-Yussuf, has urged operators of hotels and tourism-related outfits to comply with the directive of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, to shut their facilities temporarily as part of efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19, adding that the directive on ban of social gathering of more than 25 persons and observance of social distancing would be enforced by security operatives.
 
According to Akinbile-Yussuf, the call became necessary following the discovery that some operators have been defying the governor’s order by encouraging large gathering in their facilities. The commissioner explained that the state government prioritizes the wellbeing of its citizens and would not compromise their safety. She noted that the temporary closure is to enforce the social distancing of limited numbers of persons, which might be difficult when their facilities are in full session. She warned that the state government would punish errant operators to serve as deterrent to others.
 
“If anyone flouts this order, the government will not hesitate to seal up such premises and shall only be opened at the end of the pandemic and payment of appropriate fine. Therefore, all hotels, event centres, bars and restaurants, lounge, spas, theme parks/amusement parks, entertainment grounds among others fall into this category and are enjoined to comply strictly to this directive,’’ she added.
