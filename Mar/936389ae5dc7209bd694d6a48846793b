I know I’m a Formula One car… “It works because he’s there, that’s it. It’s not going to be spectacular. (Antoine) Griezmann and (Kylian) Mbappe get seen more while he rolls his sleeves up and does the dirty work. “But does everyone like his game? I don’t know.” During the 2016 and 2017 seasons ahead of up Russia 2018, Giroud scored 16 goals for France in 24 games. He also played every match at the World Cup and although he failed to find the target in Russia, his team came home with the trophy.
