As Coronavirus pandemic continues to rage and disrupt international economies, the African Energy Chamber (AEC), as well as other analysts, have stated that Nigeria and other African countries stand to lose over $110 billion in taxes, petroleum exports, jobs, and contracts to local companies over the next three months.
   
According to the AEC, though the fundamental belief is to let the market work for itself, it encourages African countries that have engaged petroleum operators and local service companies to find ways to relieve the burden on exploration programmes and local companies.
  
Already, companies are already taking a hit on their exploration programmes and have to find ways to raise capital to successfully drill wells.  This, the African Energy Chamber believes will help employers pay employees and improve their liquidity and reduce some of the losses in revenue while preventing job losses. African players were already strained by low profits and difficultly accessing capital for oil and gas projects.
   
Should the price war continue, many marginal field producers will likely go out of business, exploration programmes will be halted, licensing rounds will fail and the majors will have to make the difficult decisions of scaling back operations.
