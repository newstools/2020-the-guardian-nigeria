Children need special care and supervision, as the pandemic, Coronavirus (COVID-19) spreads throughout the world. From ensuring that they frequently and properly wash their hands to instructing them on safe hygienic measures like sneezing and coughing into their elbows to observing the five feet (1.5 metre) social distance, parents have a great role to play to protect their children form the disease. Dr. Olayide Jinadu, Medical director at Charis-Med Hospital, Lagos, said COVID-19 is a rapidly spreading virus, which seems to know no bounds, and thrives in hot and cold climates. So, it is imperative that precautions are taken to reduce the spread of the virus. He said: “Parents need to talk to their children on the Coronavirus, by ensuring good hygiene practices are carried out. Most people infected with the virus present with mild flu-like symptoms or no symptoms at all. Very few die from it. Those who die from it are unfortunately the elderly or people already living with some pre-existing illness, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus and asthma, among others.  “It is advised that we wash our hands regularly with running water and soap or with an alcohol-based hand sanitiser for about 20 seconds. Children should avoid touching their faces, keep a safe distance of at least 1.5m (five feet) from people suspected to be infected with COVID-19.  Jinadu urged parents to ensure that their kids stay hydrated, by drinking lots of clean water. “Parents should also ensure their children’s immunity is kept in check by giving them fruits and vegetables, provide and encourage the use of alcohol-based hand sanitisers, teach and encourage frequent hand washing and most importantly, spread facts and not fear.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
