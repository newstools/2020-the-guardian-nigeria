Governor Godwin Obaseki yesterday applauded mothers across Edo State for their bravery and resourcefulness in the face of daunting challenges of parenting occasioned by the disruptions of new media technologies. He also commended them for building formidable shields against vices that threaten the fabric of society. The governor, in commemoration of this year’s Mothers’ Day, said mums were deserving of praise for making sacrifices that have led to the advancement of society and still being at forefront of reforms and changes that guarantee a better future for children across all sectors of the society. He promised that the state government would continue to prioritise the needs of mothers with reforms in the healthcare system. Obaseki said: “I join the rest of the world today (yesterday) in marking Mothers’ Day. It is a special day that celebrates the efforts of mothers in engendering societal progress through their warmth and sacrifices.”
In Edo State, we cannot but recognise the efforts made by mothers in the development of the state, a feat that is glaring with the number of mothers in our government, who have made sacrifices to see that Edo people live a better life. “From reforms in healthcare to education, to affordable housing programmes to agriculture development, gender mainstreaming and many more, mothers who have been placed at strategic points in the value chain have all played huge roles in ensuring a better life for Edo people.” He continued: “At the same time, in the face of the disruptions from new media technologies that have altered life as we used to know it, we celebrate mothers for holding steadfast to and transferring practices, knowledge and ideals that keep society sane and intact.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
