Lagos State deputy governor Obafemi Hamzat on Tuesday addressed beneficiaries of Nigeria’s social investment programme N-Power who protested against alleged marginalisation in the government recruitment process. The protesters gathered in front Lagos State Television at about 9:00 am and were on their way to the Lagos State House of Assembly when they met the state deputy governor Obafemi Hamzat. “We have volunteered for them for like three years and there is a lot of recruitment going on and we have not been considered at all,” Ayo Opeyemi, a beneficiary of N-Agro and one of the coordinators of N-power beneficiaries in Lagos State, told The Guardian. “Federal government has done its part, paying us for like three years but our work benefits the state.” Hamzat said their decision to protest was not the best option to explore in such a situation. He asked the leaders of the protesters to write to the state government and faulted their marginalisation claims. “Have you ever written to any agency of government or the state government?” Hamzat asked and urged them to assign representatives among them to address their pleas to appropriate government offices in writing. Hamzat said it was impossible for the government to deliberately remove their applications if they applied for jobs. He stated that their experiences in their various fields of service will be added advantage when they apply for jobs openings. The deputy governor urged the N-power beneficiaries to apply for the jobs. He, however, expressed fears that government agencies have begun interviews for persons that applied for jobs.
