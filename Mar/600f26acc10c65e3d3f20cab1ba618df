The Nigerian Postal Service and a private firm, Ukpa hansa energy solutions, are collaborating to address Nigeria’s widening energy gap through provisions of renewable energy solutions to rural areas.Under the arrangement, NIPOST would make available its post office counters nationwide to the company, to markets its products to Nigerians. The estimated energy gap in Nigeria, according to reports, is 170,008MW, which could be catered for through renewable sources such as the solar energy, wind energy, Biomass energy, and Hydro power. Speaking at the unveiling of the solar energy products in Abuja, Postmaster General of the Federation, Dr. Ismail Adewusi, said the partnership was necessary in view of the challenges facing the nation’s power sector.He observed that with the rural areas most affected, there was a need for platforms that would address the challenges remotely. According to him, NIPOST is a key vehicle in achieving the United Nations (UN) 2020 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals in all countries. “As part of the world postal network of over 660,000 post offices, NIPOST is placed in a vantage position with about 5000 postal outlets consisting of full-fledged post offices, postal agencies and post shops with over 12000 employees across the country to offer its Agency Services by making available post office counters nationwide to Ukpa Hansa Energy Solutions Limited to markets its products to Nigerians. “This will help in the advocacy for clean energy by delivering energy solutions,” he stated.Managing Director, Ukpa Hansa energy solutions, Ewie Aimienwauu, said it was worrisome that over 55 per cent of Nigerians would still be excluded, if the nation achieved its power generation target. He noted that the products which are affordable would help address the widening access gap in the country’s power sector. He said: “We saw a vacuum and an opportunity to serve Nigeria better. We understood that a lot of Nigerians were not connected to national grid. Even if power generation goes as they say, up to 55 percent Nigerians would still be excluded because they are either in remote areas, or they live in swamps, hills which make them not accessible. “As Nigeria tries to attain the seventh target of the Sustainable Development Goals, which is access to affordable, reliable and modern electricity, we saw the need to cooperate with an organisation that has government backing, good distribution and logistic network, that is in every village and city in the country to deliver electricity. It will be of benefits to all Nigerians. “The products are for the poor because we know fully well that Nigeria has minimum wage of N30,000 and 75 per cent of them live on one dollar fifty cent a day. These products are manufactured in our factory to be affordable, reliable and durable.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
