Contrary to views in some quarters, the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) has denied charging the highest tariffs along the West African coast. General Manager, Corporate and Strategic Communications, NPA, Jatto Adams, in a statement yesterday, said its tariffs have remained the same since 1993 without any increment. He said: “In May 2019, Messers Crown Agents, who were commissioned by the Authority with the support of UK Aid produced the result of an assessment, which revealed that it is cheaper to berth general and container vessels in Nigerian ports than it is in Ghana and Togo. “Specifically, while it costs $94,567.63, Value Added Tax (VAT) inclusive, to berth a general cargo vessel with GRT of 26,770, LOA at 196m and cargo of 14,100 MT in Nigerian ports for instance, ports in Ghana and Togo charge $217,879.07 and $120, 357.58 exclusive of VAT for the same types of cargo respectively. “Similarly, while the Authority charges $108, 806.90, VAT inclusive, on a container vessel with 39,906 GRT, LOA of 261m carrying 172×20” and 139×40” containers, ports in Ghana and Togo charge $117,906.58 and $128,406.94 exclusive of VAT respectively. “The Authority would also want to reiterate that apart from towage dues, which were reviewed to cover the cost of providing the service in 2015, our tariffs have remained the same since 1993. This is also in spite of the erroneous inclusion of Stevedoring charges, which is collected by Terminal Operators as the Authority’s component. “Costs like freight rates and terminal handling charges are components outside the purview of the Nigerian Ports Authority, which has no powers to regulate economic activities at the ports,” he stated.
