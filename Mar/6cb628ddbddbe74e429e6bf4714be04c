With the escalation of the coronavirus to eight confirmed cases in the country, the Rotary Club of Amuwo, District 9110, Lagos, at the weekend took coronavirus awareness and medical outreach to Shoba community of Amuwo Odofin, Lagos State.
 
The convener and chair Service Project of the club, Rtn. Goni Zakari, said the project came at a time when people need it most as the awareness on COVID-19 must be taken to all parts of the country and segments of the society.
 
“We decided to bring our own expertise with the King’s Medical Consultancies to assist the less privileged in this area with medical outreach and reorient them on essence of keeping good hygiene, especially in this era of coronavirus. Because malaria is still claiming lives, we also provided malaria treatment, HIV tests, and checked their blood pressure.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
