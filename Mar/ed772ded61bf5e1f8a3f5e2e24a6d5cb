As part of its efforts to protect the people against coronavirus, Ekiti State Government has commenced the distribution of hand sanitisers to public primary and secondary schools in the state. Commissioner for Education, Science and Technology, Foluso Daramola, said that the decision to distribute the sanitisers was because the virus has become a global emergency. Daramola, who supervised the distribution of the items to the first set of schools in Ado-Ekiti yesterday, charged school administrators to ensure that they were used solely for the purpose they were meant. He assured that government would leave no stone unturned in its effort to protect its citizens from the deadly virus and urged parents to imbibe the culture of always keeping their homes clean and healthy to ward off rodents and other carriers of diseases. The commissioner appealed to parents and guardians of the pupils to keep sick children away from schools and seek urgent medical attention for them. Daramola also advised parents to call the emergency no 112 should they suspect their wards showing any sign of flu and appealed to teachers and parents to always wash their hand every time they touched surfaces and visited the lavatories. He added that those with the habit of touching their mouth, eyes, nose and ears with their hands should stop henceforth until the deadly coronavirus ends.
