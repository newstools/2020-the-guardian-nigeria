A Yoruba advocacy group, the Yoruba Leadership and Peace Initiative (TYLPI), at the weekend rose from a meeting with a resolve to task state governments in the Southwest on far-reaching reforms in the power, education and agricultural sectors. Reforms in these sectors, they said, were critical to returning the region to its days of socio-economic vibrancy and pace-setting in the face of worsening developmental crises in the country. TYLPI President, Mr. Olusegun Ahmadu, said this while enunciating the group’s concerns and programme of activities for the year, at the parley held at the Lead City University, Ibadan. Ahmadu noted that the situation had particularly deteriorated in the Southwest, such that the region that used to lead in education and development now lag behind other sections of the country, especially in external examinations and other indices of academic distinction. Describing this as unacceptable, the TYLPI boss said the organisation comprising prominent Yoruba intellectuals, professionals, technocrats and businessmen hoped to work with the governments and people of the geo-political zone to salvage the Southwest from perceived adverse effects of Nigeria’s “inequitable and dysfunctional federal system”. At the meeting were, TYLPI Convener, Otunba Deji Osibogun; Vice President, Chief Femi Alafe-Aluko; General Secretary, Arakunrin Olufemi J Adefemiwa; Assistant Secretary, Mr. Oluwakayode F. Adeyemi; Profs Adebisi Sowunmi and Soji Adejumo. Others were Chief Babajide Olatunde-Agbeja, Chairman, Education Committee; Agbaakin Labi Adeyemi, Treasurer, and Mr. Abiola Olagunju, Legal Adviser.
