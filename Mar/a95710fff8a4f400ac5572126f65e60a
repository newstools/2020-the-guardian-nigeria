Piers Morgan and Sam Smith | DailyMail British broadcaster, journalist, writer, and television personality Piers Morgan has told Grammy award-winning artist Sam Smith to ‘get a grip’ of himself. This is coming after the “To Die For” crooner shared numerous pictures of himself sitting on his front step crying in his pyjamas. Morgan accused Smith of being an ‘attention seeker’ for the photos that the singer captioned ‘Stages of a quarantine meltdown,’ on Instagram. A displeased Morgan shared the opinion that Smith should not be posting such photos on social media. Taking to Twitter, Piers who is a co-presenter on the show “Good Morning Britain” opined that some celebrities are using the current global situation as content for their social media accounts. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-1129553 size-full lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/San-Smith.jpg" alt="Sam Smith" width="447" height="600" /> Retweeting a link to an article about Sam Smith, Morgan wrote: ‘FFS. I can’t take any more of this celebrity attention-seeking bullsh*t. ‘Get a grip, the lot of you. ‘This is a war, not an Instagram story op.’ Sam Smith wasn’t the only celebrity Piers Morgan took aim at as he criticised a number of celebrities for taking part in a video. The video showed celebrities such as Gal Gadot, Jamie Dornan and Jimmy Fallon singing Imagine by John Lennon. Retweeting a post calling the video ‘moving’, Piers disagreed with the assessment. Interestingly, Morgan has called out Smith in the past. Morgan blamed Smith for the Brit Award deciding to do away with male and female categories, This came on the heels of the “Stay With Me” hitmaker coming out as non-binary and confirmed that he would be using the pronouns “they and them.” At the time, Morgan said: ‘I think it’s great that so much time on awards should be wrecked like this because one guy can’t decide if he’s male or female. ‘They want to accommodate non-binary performers like Sam Smith, which is what I said last week, which category will be now enter? ‘He won’t have to, he’ll now enter the non-binary categories.’ Piers went on to say that scrapping gender categories will negatively impact female performers as he believes men will win the bulk of the awards.
