The newly signed National Fertilizer Quality Control Act 2019 has awarded a stiffer penalty of at least five years imprisonment for offenders. The Act, assented into law by President Muhammadu Buhari in October 2019, prohibits unauthorised activities of manufacturers, blenders or importers and distributors of fertilizer.
 
The Act also stipulates the procedure for obtaining permits or certificate of registration; provide timeframe for issuance of authorisation by the prescribed authority; as well as establishment of grievance remedial mechanism where application is declined.
 
Speaking at the public presentation of the Act in Abuja yesterday, Prof Yemi Akinseye-George SAN said such offences include manufacturing, blending, importing or distributing of deficient fertilizer, lacking in plant nutrient specified in the First Schedule to the Act.  “As you may be aware, the journey for the establishment of Fertilizer Regulatory System for this country started as far back as 2002. It passed through several processes and suffered many defeats but finally actualised in this current administration. The aspiration for the establishment of the regulatory framework followed a fertilizer study that revealed high prevalence of low quality fertilizers in the country.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
