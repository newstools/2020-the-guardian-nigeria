• Donates Hand Sanitisers, Hand Wash, Facial Wipes, Medical Soaps, Others For Airport Safety To prevent the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic in Nigeria, leading manufacturer of personal and household hygiene products, Daraju Industries Ltd. has partnered with the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) and Bi-Courtney Aviation Services Ltd to safeguard the airports for workers and travellers as well as enlighten them on how to prevent contracting the virus. Daraju Industries donated free hand sanitisers, wash gel, facial wipes and bar soaps to FAAN and Bi-Courtney to deploy at the Murtala Muhammad International Airport and MMA2 for a one month. The Chief Operations Officer of the company, Captain Mukherjee said: “In many instances, infectious disease originated in a foreign country extends into other countries through the international airports and other port of entries such as the case of the Ebola epidemic in 2014. Therefore, the ports are essentially frontlines to prevent, tackle or curb disease from spreading into a country. Hence, we deemed it very appropriate, in partnership with FAAN to deploy hand sanitisers and other hand hygiene solutions in the airport…” The International Airport Terminal Manager, Mr. Olatokunbo Arewa thanked Daraju management team for the initiative and called on the private sector to actively get involved in the prevention initiative. Arewa said the COVID-19 is a global concern, which requires all hands to be on deck to tackle it at all fronts.
