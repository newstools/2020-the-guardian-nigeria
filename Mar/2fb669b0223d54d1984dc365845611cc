Nigerian Government Monday advised residents of Abuja and Lagos, the two cities which are hardest hit by coronavirus, to stay at home “until further advice is given.” Lagos state which has the highest number of cases so far has taken steps in the last few days to break the circle of transmission. Such measures included shutting down all schools in the state and limiting the number of people at social and religious gathering to a maximum of 50. The state is also drifting towards total lockdown as cases keep increasing. However, all international airports in the country have stopped welcoming international flights and suspended its visa-on-arrival programme. Land borders have also been closed to human traffic for four weeks as one of the persons, who tested positive for the virus, entered the country through one of its land borders.
