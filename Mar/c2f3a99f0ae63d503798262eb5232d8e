Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has urged Nigerians not to engage in panic buying of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), as the country has adequate stock of the products to last for over 60-days. Mr Mele Kyari, Group Managing Director of the corporation, gave the assurance while briefing newsmen on Sunday in Abuja. Kyari assured that the NNPC had the support of all stakeholders to ensure an adequate supply of petroleum products in the country. He said: “There is absolutely no scarcity anywhere; our supply is robust, we have fuel that will last this country even for 60-days if assuming we do not import any. “Of course people because of the pandemic, stay at home, may try to conserve fuel, there is no need to do this. “Maintain your normal life, we have secured all assurances that trucks will be moving freely across the country throughout this period of difficulty and supply will be sustained’’. He appealed to Nigerians no to flood fuel stations as there was no need for that. Commenting on National Association of Road Transport Owners (NARTO) order to petrol tankers drivers to vacate the depots, Kyari said that the corporation would continue to engage them. “No restrictions; as we speak now loading is going on, trucks are moving around, no action like that will come to fruition,’’ he added.
