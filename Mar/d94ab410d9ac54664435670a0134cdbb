Drake | XXL Mag Canadian rapper Drake has revealed that he tested positive to coronavirus. The “God’s Plan” rapper made this known during an Instagram Live session with his father Dennis Graham. The Grammy award-winning rapper who had to self-isolate after he was exposed to the virus said he took the test during his self-imposed quarantine. “I had to take a test yesterday,” Drake told his dad. “Yeah, I had to do a test, but it came back negative. That test is uncomfortable, though. They put that q-tip all the way inside your thoughts and shit.” Drake and Kevin Durant |HypeBeast Drake was exposed to the novel coronavirus after hanging out at the Nice Guy club in West Hollywood with Brooklyn Nets star Kevin Durant who has since tested positive. Durant who plays for The Brooklyn Nets announced he tested positive for COVID-19 on Tuesday, March 17. Despite testing negative, Drake will presumably continue to self-quarantine at his Toronto mansion. So far, four members of the Brooklyn Nets have tested positive for COVID-19. “All four players are presently isolated and under the care of team physicians,” the team said. “The organization is currently notifying anyone who has had known contact with the players, including recent opponents, and is working closely with state and local health authorities on reporting. “All players and members of the Nets travel party are being asked to remain isolated, closely monitor their health and maintain constant communication with team medical staff. The health of our players and staff is of the highest priority to the organization and the team is doing everything within its power to ensure that those affected receive the best care possible.” Last week, President Trump and Canadian Prime Minister James Trudeau agreed to halt any non-essential travel between the two countries that aren’t trade-related.
