It shed 3.72 percent to 22,695.88 from 23, 572.75 at which it opened for trading yesterday, largely due to the persistent sell pressure on medium/large capitalised stocks Specifically, at the close of trading Thursday, the All-Share Index (ASI) decreased by 876.87 absolute points, representing a dip of 3.72 per cent to close at 22,695.88 points.

The centre of it all is China and being a major world power both in productive and consumption capacities, any ill wind affecting China would naturally cause a big sneezing to the rest of world. “Investors should not panic.
