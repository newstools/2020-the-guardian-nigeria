Oyo State Governor, Engr. Seyi Makinde, yesterday, assured residents of the stateâ€™s readiness to provide palliatives to ease the pressure occasioned by the partial shutdown of activities, to curtail the spread of COVID-19. He, however, said the state would need to work on accurate data and design to ensure that the palliatives get into the hands of residents with genuine needs for them and not get cornered by middlemen. According to a statement signed by the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Mr. Taiwo Adisa, Governor Makinde, made the disclosure during a phone-in interview programme on Fresh FM 105.9 and a one-hour Tweetchat on Twitter, noting that government has stepped up enlightenment campaigns on the pandemic and enforcement measures on the lockdown of activities. The governor maintained that as part of measures to contain the spread of the disease, the state in collaboration with College of Medicine and University College Hospital has set up a diagnostic centre to handle testing of samples, noting that the state was only awaiting NCDC endorsement. He explained that once the centres are certified, they would become easier to test more people. Governor Makinde added that apart from the preventive measures, the state has set up isolation centres, with four-bed isolation unit in Ogbomoso, 10-bed at Jericho, four-bed at UCH and 100-bed capacity at Olodo, Ibadan, which will be ready on Thursday.
