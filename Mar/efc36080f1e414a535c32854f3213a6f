Ekiti State governor Kayode Fayemi The Senior Special Assistant on Party matter to the Governor of Ekiti state Sam Oluwalana has said Senator Babafemi Ojudu’s comment that the state had not recorded any achievements under Governor Fayemi’s administration is “selfish” and “fault-finding.” “Our attention has been drawn to a distasteful interview published in the Tribune where Senator Babafemi Ojudu insinuated that the Fayemi Administration had not recorded any achievements especially in the area of industrialization and youth empowerment,” Olualana said in a statement on Tuesday. “It is curious that such would be priority for an aide of Mr President in the midst of this global pandemic that Nigeria is trying to control.” Oluwalana said Ojudu’s claims came at the wrong time when the state recently reported a positive case of Coronavirus infection. He stated that “unlike Senator Ojudu, protecting the lives of Ekiti people is more important to the governor at this crucial time than to join issues with Senator Ojudu on his political journey to perdition.” “Fayemi is focused on managing the pandemic which is threatening the peace and tranquility of Ekiti State and may put the lives of the same electorate that Senator Ojudu is worried will not vote for APC, at risk,” Oluwana said. Oluwana, however, maintained that the Fayemi administration is very alive to its responsibilities to Ekiti people and prioritizing the future of Ekiti youth “Only the living vote; so we advise the insensitive senator to get his priorities right and join the state government efforts to defeat this pandemic, instead of being his true selfish self, caring only about electoral victories in the midst of a public health pandemic,” Oluwana said.
