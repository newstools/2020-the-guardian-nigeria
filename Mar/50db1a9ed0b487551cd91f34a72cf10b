As the world celebrates the International Women’s Day (IWD) on March 8, 2020, experts have stressed the need for gender equality, saying that it is necessary for economies and communities to thrive. Chief Business Officer of AB Microfinance Bank, Pawel Wodz, stated this on the sidelines of IWD, noting that it would celebrate the day by honouring its female clients and members of staff at a special event in Lagos. He stressed that the bank recognises the contributions of women to the nation’s economic development and that women constitute over 60 per cent of the bank’s borrowers base. He added that over the years, women have shown great entrepreneurial acumen in growing their businesses through facilities from the bank and have proven good repayment behaviour, which inspires great trust in Nigerian women as business partners.
