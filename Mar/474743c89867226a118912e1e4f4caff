As Lagos state government continues to contain the pandemic coronavirus (COVID-19), Mushin Local Government has recorded its first case of the virus. Mushin Local Government chairman Emmanuel Bamigboye in a statement by his media aide Sanusi Rasaq said a case of the COVID-19 was reported at Takuro Street, in Idi-Araba of the area of Mushin last week. He said the medical team of the local government led by Dr Wale Akeredolu from Ministry of Health was informed and the patient was transferred to the disease/virus control centre at IDH, Yaba. Bamigboye explained that the patient is already receiving treatment at Yaba, Lagos, adding his family members have been quarantined to contain the virus. He enjoined residents not to panic as the COVID-19 case recorded is being treated. He disclosed that emergency meetings have been held at the Council Secretariat, with executive members, management staff, Community Development Associations (CDAs) leaders and market leaders to address the issue of the recorded case at Takuro Street. The council boss told residents that the COVID-19 is real and it spread so fast. He, however, task residents to follow the directive of the government (local, state and federal) by regularly washing their hands, use hand sanitizers, avoid gathering of more than 20 people. He advised them to practise social distancing, cover their mouth when coughing and sneezing, use a medical mask, and visit hospitals for test if they feel coronavirus symptoms. “We need be careful of the places we go to now to avoid contact with infected persons because Lagos state recorded the highest number of cases. This is not the time for social gatherings in churches, mosques, clubs, weddings, birthday parties, etc as the world is fighting against COVID-19,” Bamigboye said.
