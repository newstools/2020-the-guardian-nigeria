So far, 22 of the 30 cases were confirmed in Lagos State. Four cases were confirmed in Abuja, one case in Ekiti, two in Ogun State and one in Oyo State. Two of the cases have been declared negative and discharged in Lagos State after treatment at government facility in Yaba, Lagos. Most of the cases were imported into the country by either returning Nigerians or foreigners. Nigeria has since placed travel restriction on 15 countries with high prevalence of the global pandemic. Nigeria has also suspended its visa on arrival policy and shut down all airports in the country to international flights. The federal and state governments have closed schools and tertiary institutions in the country to prevent further spread of the virus.
