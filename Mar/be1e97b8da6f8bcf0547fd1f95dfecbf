Doctors at the Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH), Idi-Araba, have recommended a Haplo-identical allogenic bone marrow transplant for two-year old Eronna Uriel Chijindum in India, at an estimated cost of N20 million. Chijindum, a native of Imo State, who was diagnosed of Diamond-Blackfan Anaemia, was first treated in 2018 for severe neonatal hyperbilirubinaenia where he had two-Exchange Blood Transfusion (EBT) done, but still presented recurrent anaemia, necessitating blood transfusions worth N45,000 on a monthly basis. According to his mother, Promise Eronna, the hematologist at LUTH conducted a bone marrow aspiration test on him, which showed marked depression of erythropoiesis and needs a bone marrow transplant at BLK Super Special Hospital in New Delhi, India, which is why they are appealing to the public for funds to carry out the surgery in order to save her sonâ€™s life. His details are GTBank, Eronna Uriel Chijindum 0479468610. His mother can be reached on 08124652952.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
