The Osun Government has ordered the indefinite suspension of designated weekly markets across the state as part of measures to curb the spread of Coronavirus. Dr Rafiu Isamotu, the State Commissioner for Health, disclosed this during a sensitisation visit to some markets in Osogbo on Tuesday. Isamotu said that only the daily markets would be allowed to open, but with regular monitoring to ensure strict compliance with precautionary measures to prevent the spread of the global COVID-19 pandemic. The commissioner said that the suspension of the weekly markets was necessary because Osun has boundaries with some states with reported cases of the virus. He said people from neighboring states who might have the virus could patronise the weekly markets, and thereby make Osun open to the virus. Isamotu appealed to market women to support the governmentâ€™s effort in curtailing the spread of the disease by providing handwashing facilities as well as hand sanitizer for their customers. In her response, the Iyaloja General in Osun, Alhaja Awawu Asindemade, appreciated the state government for the various proactive measures taken in ensuring the safety of the citizens. Asindemade said the association of market women was ever ready to comply with the directive and regulations of the state government for the benefit of all.
