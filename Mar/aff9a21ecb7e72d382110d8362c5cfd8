By now the embattled National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Comrade Adams Aliu Oshiomhole, must have come to the sudden realization that no party chairman has ever won a political battle against the governor of his home state.
   
If he peeps across the party divide, the former governor of Edo State would see how far a former National Chairman of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Dr. Okwesilieze Nwodo, fared in his political hostilities with the then Governor Sullivan Chime, when he (Nwodo) tried to work in concert with those opposed to Chime’s second term to botch the governor’s ambition.
 
Had Oshiomhole beckoned on history, he would not have made the mistake of doing a local political fight with his governor, even if one he begat by his power and might, because to this day, nobody has sighted the court order granting the injunctive relief on Nwodo to stop parading himself as the national chairman of PDP.  The battle is on and more voices think it’s time for Oshiomhole to step aside. But nobody expects him to go down without a fight, being the pugilist he has been. To stoke more confusion, last Thursday, a Kano High court tried to upturn his suspension, but the rank of APC governors who want him out is swelling. Only time will tell how much energy the embattled chair has in his reserves to weather these storms. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
