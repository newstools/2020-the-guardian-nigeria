Supports Right of Passage for all telecommunications members
As the COVID-19, better known as coronavirus continues to ravage the global community; the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has approved resource sharing by Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) throughout the period of the pandemic. This resource sharing includes fibre optics cables and others in the event of cable cuts and other unforeseen developments during the period of coronavirus outbreak. NCC Director of Public Affairs, Dr. Henry Nkemadu, said the commission has also directed MNOs to ensure that their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programmes are in tandem with government initiatives to curtail the COVID-19 pandemic in order to provide safety and support aid materials that will protect the public against coronavirus. NCC announced that in conjunction with industry players and all other government agencies, it has agreed to reduce the frequency of physical meetings all through the period of the coronavirus outbreak and consider alternative electronic meeting platforms, in order to reduce person to person contact that may arise from travels or meetings. The telecoms regulator explained that departments within the Commission that interface with customers have developed e-platforms where all licensing requests, consumer complaints and BTS investigation requests could be channeled  or provide designated e-mail addresses to be used for such requests throughout the pandemic period. “All social and official visits to the Commission have been cancelled immediately and visitors advised to use relevant online platforms and or telephone services in accessing the Commission’s services,” NCC stated. For those who may be affected, NCC implored them to take advantage of the Emergency Communications Centres (ECC) by dialing the toll free number 112. The NCC said it supports Right of Passage (RoP) for all telecommunications members for easy movement in the event of a total lock down and or restriction of movement. The regulator is also in support of RoP for suppliers that are involved in supplies of fuels, foods and other support services to telecom operators, to allow for free movement in the event of partial or total lock down as a result of the coronavirus. “We are in touch with Law Enforcement Agencies to constantly protect telecom infrastructure nationwide. We will come out from time to time with enlightenment information on the dangers of the virus so that consumers can be guided accordingly. “Since we are in this together, no effort would be spared to bring this deadly disease to an end,” NCC stated.
