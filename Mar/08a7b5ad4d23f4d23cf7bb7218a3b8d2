Daniela Trezzi, 34, was working on the front line of the coronavirus crisis at a hospital in Lombardy, the worst-affected region of Italy according to report by The Daily Mail. The National Federation of Nurses of Italy confirmed her death and expressed its ‘pain and dismay’ in a statement last night. The federation said the nurse had been suffering ‘heavy stress’ because she feared she was spreading the virus while trying to bring the crisis under control. Italy’s death toll went really high again 25th March,2019 with 743 new fatalities recorded in one day, dampening hopes that the tide was starting to turn. However, the number of total infections rose by just eight percent, the lowest level since Italy registered its first death on February 21. Daniela Trezzi had been working on the intensive care ward at the San Gerardo Hospital in Monza, around nine miles from Milan, but was in quarantine after showing coronavirus symptoms and testing positive for the disease. Nino Cartabellotta, the head of the Gimbe foundation which collected the data, urged that this ‘phenomenon’ must be ‘curbed to safeguard those who take care of us’. As of yesterday, Italy reported 683 new deaths in the coronavirus pandemic, bringing its total to 7,503. However, more than 113,000 of the 454,000 people diagnosed with the disease have recovered, according to data collected by Johns Hopkins University. About 20,500 people worldwide have died from COVID-19.
