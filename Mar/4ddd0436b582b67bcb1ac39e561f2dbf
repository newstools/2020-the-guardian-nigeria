The Super Eagles will host Sierra Leone in the third match of the Cameroun 2021 African Cup of Nations qualifying series… next month.<br />PHOTO: FEMI ADEBESIN-KUTI The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) General Secretary, Sanusi Mohammed believes the country’s foreign-based players, who are currently out of action due to the rampaging Coronavirus (COvid-19), will be fit to play against Sierra Leone whenever the postponed 2021 African Cup of Nations qualifier is fixed. Nigeria will host Sierra Leone on a yet-to-fixed date at the Stephen Keshi Stadium, Asaba. Speaking with The Guardian at the weekend, Mohammed said the NFF was delighted that CAF considered the inconveniencies and travel challenges facing the foreign-based players before postponing the qualifiers. “Most of the Super Eagles players that will battle Sierra Leone in the AFCON 2021 qualifier are currently not playing for their clubs because of Coronavirus issues in their various countries. “I believe CAF will not give any pronouncement on a new date for the qualifiers if football and sporting activities do not resume in Europe. So the Super Eagles players would have gotten back to action and battle ready for the AFCON qualifiers whenever the game is fixed. “The Coronavirus is a global phenomenon now and other countries in the world are also facing challenges of how to reorganize their calendar,” he added.
