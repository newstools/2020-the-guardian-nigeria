The initiative follows similar efforts by Facebook on its core social platform as well as on its Messenger and WhatsApp services and by other platforms such as YouTube and Twitter. More than two billion people use at least one of Facebook’s “family” of applications daily. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
