When the embattled former Governor of Edo State, Mr. Adams Oshiomhole, emerged unopposed as national chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) during the party’s national convention in 2018, hardly did he realise that those forces which opposed him, but wanted his predecessor Chief John Odie-Oyegun to continue in office simply lay low and bided for the best opportunity to strike. One after the other, those who contested the chairmanship position with Oshiomhole withdrew from the race on or before the convention, with the last being Oserheimen Osunbor, a professor and former governor of Edo State, who said he withdrew out of respect for President Muhammadu Buhari and not for Oshiomhole.
  
In a similar manner, former Governor of Cross Rivers State, Mr. Clement Ebri, who also stepped down for Oshiomhole, didn’t say he did out of respect for the former Edo State governor but “in the overall interest of the party.” And since Oshiomhole had no opponent, the chairman of the Convention Committee, Badru Abubakar, simply asked the delegates to ratify the only candidate (Oshiomhole) through a voice vote, which was promptly done.  “Such activities only speak volumes of the selfish interests of members,” claimed a member of the party.  “We did not only retain the presidency but also won the majority of the seats at the National Assembly. This gave birth to the progressive leadership at the two arms of the National Assembly,” the party claimed.
  
The Lagos chapter said it could definitely not dismiss Oshiomhole’s monumental achievements, which included breaking new grounds to the discomfort of opposition parties.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
