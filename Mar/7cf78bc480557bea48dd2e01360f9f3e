Editorial manager for the digital division of The Guardian Newspaper, Lolade Nwanze has urged media practitioners to stop blaming rape victims when reporting rape incidences. She made this submission yesterday in Abuja at a two-day workshop on gender reporting for media professionals organised by TechHer, insisting that blame must be centered on the perpetrators. She added that if a report related to gender based violence makes the victim feel bad, the author has not done a good job. She stressed the need to involve women in newsroom management and decision making to address imbalances and pledged commitment towards improved and adequate reportage for the vulnerable in the society. Speaking earlier, Project lead of TechHer, Kawthar Ahmed explained that the workshop was initiated to bring journalists together to discuss how to properly report gender base issues.
