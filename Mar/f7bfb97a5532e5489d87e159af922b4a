National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) has identified fraudulent websites trying to capitalize on the Covid-19 pandemic to defraud unsuspecting Nigerians. Mrs Hadiza Umar, head, Corporate Affairs & External Relations, National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) made this revelation in a statement released, in Abuja. The Agency said that its Computer Emergency Readiness and Response Team (CERRT) identified a number of websites using various phishing tricks to attract Internet users. One of such tricks, according to the statement, “is misinforming the public that Federal Government has ordered weekly payment of allowances to all citizens above the age of 18 for observing the ‘Stay At Home’ directive. “It then requires the user to complete an online form with the personal information including bank details for the payment to be effected”. The statement further revealed that the Agency is doing everything possible to shut down the websites identified as well as sanction those behind them. They however, call on the general public to disregard and report any such websites to the Agency for necessary action. The statement further advised the general public and internet users to take precautionary measure, and observe the following whenever they are online: not to give out their personal information to anyone online; avoid clicking unknown links;  disregard offers requesting for their bank details; and know what to do when they become victims of cybercrime. The Agency also called on all well-meaning Nigerians to support the Federal Government in its efforts at containing the spread of Covid-19 in the country. “We are all encouraged to strictly adhere to recommendations given by health experts, and follow updates from relevant agencies handling this outbreak.” the statement reads.
