However, the authorities still hope to finish the season once play can be restarted rather than accepting the current standings as final or declaring the campaign null and void. “We’re united in our commitment to finding ways of resuming the 2019-20 football season and ensuring all domestic and European club league and cup matches are played as soon as it is safe and possible to do so,” added the statement.
