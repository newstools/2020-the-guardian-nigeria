To embrace the backward integration and import substitution policies of the Federal Government, Promasidor Nigeria has keyed into the plans by sourcing local contents for the production of its latest product to create positive value chain effects.
 
Launching SunVita Choco Crunch to commemorate the World Cereal Day in Lagos, the Managing Director of the company, Anders Einarsson, said the product is proudly Nigerian and healthy family cereal meal made from locally sourced maize, soya and premium quality cocoa powder.
 
“It contains a branded ingredient known as NUTRI-V, a blend of seven power-packed micro-nutrients (vitamins and minerals-vitamin A, B6, B9, C, Zinc, Calcium, Iron) necessary for healthy body and brain development,” he added.
 
Einarsson pledged the support for the government’s initiatives for local contents for economic diversification, employment and economic prosperity as entrenched in the Green Alternative policy.
 
Ayodeji explained that a distinguishing quality of the product is its ability to retain its crunch-nature even after water has been introduced to it for at least three to five minutes.   
  
“Only SunVita Choco Crunch provides such a mix of an intense indulgent rich chocolate taste and crunchiness. The launch of SunVita Choco Crunch confirms our commitment to using our unique and deep knowledge of the Nigerian market in creating nourishing and healthy foods for all,” he said.
