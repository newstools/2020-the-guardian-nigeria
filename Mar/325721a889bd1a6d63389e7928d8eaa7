All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate, Adam Rufai, has won the Kwara State House of Assembly by-election for Patigi Constituency, having scored 10,354 votes, the highest in the election. He was declared the winner by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) returning officer, Dr. Abdulazeez Musbau from University of Ilorin. Candidates of African Action Congress (AAC), African Democratic Congress (ADC), Allied Peoples Movement (APM), New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) contested the election with APC’s Rufai. The returning officer said, “Adam Ahmed Rufai of the APC, having satisfied the requirements of the law and scored the highest number of votes cast, is hereby declared the winner.” According to INEC records, 43,695 Permanent Voters Cards (PVCs) are in the hands of the electorate in the constituency.  But only 15,654 came out to vote during the exercise, representing 35 per cent of the eligible voters. Rufai defeated his major contender from the PDP, Mohammed Yahaya, who polled 4,623. He will replace Saidu Rufai, his brother who died in December last year. Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs in the state, Mrs. Aisha Pategi, who is also from the constituency, said: “The victory is a sign that APC is still much on the ground in Patigi. Though we lost a gem in the late lawmaker, we give glory to the almighty Allah for this victory.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
