Urge hotel operators to allow only lodging, accommodation services for now The Lagos State Police Command yesterday appealed to hoteliers to render only lodging/accommodation services and ensure they have a fewer number of workers on duty for now. The command also banned all swimming pools, conferences and events as well as any other service that could attract a crowd to hotels, urging hoteliers to comply with the directives of the state government aimed at containing the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. The command added that, in the last six days, it had deployed its personnel across the state to ensure that the guidelines and directives issued by both the federal and state governments to prevent the spread of coronavirus are fully obeyed. In effect, the enforcement team has shut down eight clubs, 15 schools, six event centres and eight places of worship for non-compliance. According to the Lagos State police spokesman, Bala Elkana, “enforcement of social distancing has been extended to open markets, malls, eateries and other business concerns which do not fall under the essential commodity category, following the directives issued by the Lagos State Government on Tuesday, March 24. The enforcement would now be extended to all markets and stores, except markets that are selling food items, water, medicine, pharmacies, medical equipment and other related essential life-saving products, with effect from Thursday, March 26. “Corporate bodies such as financial institutions, telecommunication companies and businesses not affected by the ban should also ensure that both their employees and customers/clients are not more than 25 in number at a time. Workers should be posted to ATM stands to ensure that customers using the services space themselves to avoid body contact. “Eateries should encourage their customers to use take-away services and those who must sit in the restaurant/eatery should apply the required spacing guidelines. Eateries should not have more than 25 persons at a time, including their staff. “Hotels should only operate lodging and accommodation services with minimal number of staff on duty. Conference and event halls, swimming pools and other services attracting crowds should be suspended in line with the order and directives of the government. “The Commissioner of Police Lagos State, CP Hakeem Odumosu, enjoined the good people of Lagos to obey the safety regulations put in place by government for the benefit of everyone. Violators will be dealt with in line with extant laws. Together we can prevent the spread of COVID-19,” the statement noted. Bala added that, “for information or complaints regarding non-compliance call the following numbers 09010512285, 09010512286, 09010512287 and 09010512288.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
