•Agbaje says GTB will crash data price if licensed as telco About 30 per cent of banking revenues are said to be coming from the various digital platforms made available to customers.
   
This was disclosed by the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Guaranty Trust Bank (GTB) Plc, Segun Agbaje, at the just concluded Social Media Week (SMW) Lagos, 2020.
   
Speaking on ‘Going beyond the digital experience’, Agbaje said that banks have realised that anybody who has the ability to leverage digital technology has become a competitor and is now competing with traditional banks who historically owned the payment and financial services space.
  
“About 30 percent of banking revenues come from the payment space. Of course there is also competition for loans, credit and for those who do salary advances; but the critical space that people are fighting for today on digital platforms is payments. All the other things that come on the back of that are add-ons,” he said.  “Already, leading telecommunications service providers in Nigeria have been granted payment service banking (PSB) licenses, and have started intense push to ramp up mobile money numbers in volumes and value, especially as they seem to be advantaged with penetration levels and subscriber numbers. It therefore goes without saying, that traditional banks would need to do much more than simply provide digital payment options for customers in Nigeria.
   
“It is also important for banks to note that apart from Fintech and Telcos, global companies which are not fintech but provide such services like Alipay, Amazon pay, Apple pay, Google pay and the rest, have advantages that local banks cannot have. These companies have the resources and the technical know-how, such that anytime they choose to play on the African continent, it would be an easy entry for them and 30 per cent of banking income is easily at risk,” he stated.
