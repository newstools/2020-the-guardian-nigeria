Gospel recording artist IBK is set to release her debut album titled “Abba” at a Live in concert on the 8th of March, 2020. The concert which is set to hold in Lagos at Plot 22, Providence Road, Lekki Phase 1 will feature performances from Tim Godfrey, alongside, Frank Edwards, Eben, Enkay, Larry J, Okeysokay, Sac, Blessyn and other talented gospel artistes. IBK came onto the music scene six years ago with the release of her debut track “Atobiju”. At the time, IBK was a revelation and since then gone ahead to feature verses and hooks on several of Tim Godfrey’s hits. In April 2019, she released her debut single titled “Iyanu”. In this beautiful song, she brought to the fore the wonderous works and the unpredictability of His ways. According to her, “God is unfathomable, His power is undeniable, and His ways are unimaginable”. Her most recent single “Aliwileshe” was released on the 18th of February 2020 and is currently ranked No.1 on Xclusivegospel’s song of the week. “Alewileshe” is a worship song that rises slowly into mid-tempo with a guitar fusion and a pop beat. The long wait by her budding fanbase for an album is finally over. Since the year started IBK had teased her fans with several posts that hinted at a live recording and album release concert which is now only a few days away.
