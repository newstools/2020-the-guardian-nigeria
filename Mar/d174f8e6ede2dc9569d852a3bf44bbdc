These states are Ogun, Abuja, and Lagos. This lockdown becomes imperative in order to curb the spread of the virus which has affected a lot of people. The address reads: Based on the advice of the Federal Ministry of Health and the NCDC, I am directing the cessation of all movements in Lagos and the FCT for an initial period of 14 days with effect from 11 pm on Monday, 30th March 2020. This restriction will also apply to Ogun State due to its close proximity to Lagos and the high traffic between the two States. All citizens in these areas are to stay in their homes. Travel to or from other states should be postponed. All businesses and offices within these locations should be fully closed during this period. This has caused a wave of reactions. Below are some reactions to the news: Lagos, Ogun and Abuja to be locked down for 14 days and movements restricted. This is a great initiative to minimize the spread of coronavirus in Nigeria. — ‘Tunde Omotoye (@TundeTASH) March 29, 2020  Someone should explain this Lagos lockdown to me abeg, shey dem dey lockdown since, abi lockdown get levels? — Oma (@sexy_oma_) March 29, 2020  With the lockdown of Lagos, Abuja and Ogun State, I am confident, significantly more than I was few hours ago, that Nigeria  will beat coronavirus. — Dr. Dípò Awójídé (@OgbeniDipo) March 29, 2020  Buhari announced a shutdown the day before the shutdown. Sorry to the folks in Lagos and Abuja. — Ayo Sogunro – #Transformist (@ayosogunro) March 29, 2020  In Nigeria, we solve problem from the surface and not the root. Don’t be surprise if you start seeing headlines like “Family of 5 in Lagos/Ogun axis or in Abuja died of hunger” even this #COVID19 will be second to it. If we only consider the displaced and the IDP people then 1/3 — Dr. Akeula Trendy  (@akeula_trendy) March 29, 2020  Lagos is the epicentre of coronavirus in Nigeria. The Lagos masses must find a way to survive. It will be a tough time. No movement for 2 weeks! It will be difficult but I trust Lagos to find its groove. We will all learn how to survive.#LagosLockdown — OMO IYA ALAMALA (@sama_on_point) March 29, 2020  Nigeria will be lockdown from tomorrow and food will be made available for the poor. This is the message I got from that speech and I’m happy about it.#BuhariAddressNigerians — EL~FARIS (@elfaris24) March 29, 2020  The focus here should be how you will use @JumiaFoodNG to deliver our birthday Jollof rice. The President emphatically stated that food distribution & retail companies can open/operate during the 14 100% lockdown in Lagos, Abuja and Ogun. eCommerce to the rescue. pic.twitter.com/nco6gaNPnZ — AgbaAkin Moruff ADENEKAN (@AgbaAkin_MA) March 29, 2020  A lot of people in Lagos, Abuja and Ogun state will probably get infected tomorrow. I mean, a whole lot of people will be at the bank, market and mall tomorrow to get things before the lockdown. Social Distancing will be technically impossible tbf. — IZY || Israel (@izybaby01) March 29, 2020  Dear @NGRPresident the lock down of Lagos, Abuja and Ogun state is the right call, the virus need to be tamed and tamed fast. We could argue of not having enough time to prepare for it, but the virus won’t wait for anyone. @MBuhari please assist those who can’t feed at this time — Adelekan Adeolu (@senatorspeaks) March 29, 2020
