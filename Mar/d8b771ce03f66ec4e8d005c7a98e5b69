The University of Lagos (UNILAG) chapter of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) has condemned the suspension of the institution’s 51st convocation, which was billed to hold from March 9 to 12, 2020. But a letter from the permanent secretary, ministry of education, Echono to the executive secretary of the National Universities Commission (NUC) had directed the institution’s management to suspend the ceremony following complaints from the chairman of the governing council, Wale Babalakin that he was not carried along in the process. Babalakin allegedly disagreed with the school’s management over the choice of the convocation lecturer, Isa Pantami, minister of communication and digital economy. Babalakin was said to have preferred a former president of Ghana as the convocation lecturer. But ASUU president, UNILAG chapter, Dele Ashiru described the suspension as inhuman and wicked.  “Our union condemns this wicked, inhuman, egoistic, retrogressive, unconscionable and satanic postponement of this historic convocation ceremony on account of the over bloated ego of the pro-chancellor. That the Ministry of Education could by fiat request the executive secretary of the NUC to advise the vice chancellor to suspend the ceremony without investigating the veracity of Babalakin’s claim is not only worrisome but highly depressing.” Also, in a letter dated March 2 in response to Babalakin’s claim, the vice chancellor said the university followed the pro-chancellor’s directives and did not contravene any law. “You sir, personally made input to the convocation arrangements and these can be verified by the audio recording and minutes of the council meetings of January 21 and 22.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
