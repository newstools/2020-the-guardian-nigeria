India will host the T20 World Cup, a revamped version of the former Champions Trophy, in October-November of 2021. It is not to be confused with this year’s T20 World Cup in Australia. India will also hold the 50-over World Cup in 2023. This year’s Indian Premier League, the world’s richest cricket league, is one of the many sports events worldwide to be postponed including the Tokyo Olympics, which have been delayed until next year. The ICC said this year’s remaining qualifiers are being “continually monitored”. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
