The management of Greensprings School, Lagos, has announced the indefinite postponement of its yearly “Greensprings Kanu Football Camp.”
   
The event, scheduled to hold from April 5 to 10, was postponed following the global spread of the virus, which has claimed several lives across the globe, the school said yesterday.
 
The school’s Head of Corporate Strategy, Mr Uche Ogbu, who announced this in Lagos yesterday, said, “It was a tough decision for us to postpone the football camp, as many parents have already registered their children for the ninth edition of the football camp. “Initially, we were hoping that the virus pandemic would get better, but there hasn’t been any meaningful improvement. Therefore, we had to make the hard decision of postponing the camp. “We did this in compliance with the World Health Organization’s (WHO) recommendation that mass gathering of people should be avoided. Moreover, the safety of children that would be attending the camp is very important to us.”
 
Revealing that the school is taking other precautionary measures to keep the virus at bay, he added that the students of the school have been well-educated on how to protect themselves and their family from the virus; stating that hand sanitizer dispensers have been installed at strategic locations within the three campuses of the school, as well as in their special needs school – Anthos House.
