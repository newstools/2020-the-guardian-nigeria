He said the two people died in the Western Cape province, as the country went under a nationwide 21-day lockdown that took effect at midnight. The minister promised to release more details later “when we announce the latest confirmed COVID-19 cases, which have increased from yesterday’s number and have tipped the 1,000 mark”. On Friday, the country reported 927 confirmed cases, a more than 30 percent jump from the previous day. In a bid to halt the spread, some 57 million people have been ordered to stay at home during the three-week total lockdown. But many people defied the order — going about business as usual while some lined up outside food stores or queuing up for transport at bus terminals on Friday morning.
