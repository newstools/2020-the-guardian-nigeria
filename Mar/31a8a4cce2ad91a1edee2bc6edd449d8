Former Minister of Sports, Dr. Bolaji Abdullahi has canvassed the use of sporting activities to empower women in the polity. Abdullahi argued that women and girls stood the chance of earning huge monies from sports, which in turn would boost the economic fortunes of their siblings and parents in dire need of necessities of life. Abdullahi spoke in Abuja during the official launch of Women and Girls Empowerment (WAGE), a flagship programme expected to set Nigeria on the pathway in achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs). Abdullahi, who is the immediate past national publicity secretary of the ruling All Progressive Congress (APC), said it behoved on women and girls to explore the economic benefits of sports, than limiting their focus to winning gold and silver medals in major competitions. Reminiscing his encounter with an athlete in the United States of America (U.S.) while he was at the helm in the sports ministry, he noted: “It is very true that you can incorporate sports to empower girls. I think it is one of the things we have to pay attention to.” “We can use sports to empower girls. I recall that one day when I led athletes to Atlanta, U.S., a lady walked up to me to say you don’t know what you have done to me.  I run because it is the only way to take care of my mum. “That was the first time I realised that these things we are doing for athletes is not just about winning medals, but it is a means of livelihood.” Mr. Hamza Lawal, who is the initiator of follow the money, assured that WAGE would create outreaches to not only empower women and girls, but also tackle the menace of violence unleashed against them across the country.
