Chairman of the agency, CSP Olayinka Egbeyemi, who led the enforcement team, disclosed that before the removal, occupants of the illegal structures were served a seven-day ‘Removal Notice’ to vacate the entire area as well as the vicinity of the schools within the stipulated period. Egbeyemi stated further that the removal was sequel to numerous complaints and petitions by residents, particularly management of the public schools (Imoye High School and Amuwo Odofin Junior Secondary School) that criminal elements have turned the area into hideouts/spots for carrying out their nefarious activities, thereby making the environment unpleasant for living or learning. He, however, confirmed that the agency has commenced verification of the claims of those affected but with legal documentation for the payment of monetary compensation as approved by Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu.
