Youtube on Wednesday launched two features in Nigeria that enable users to continue playing a YouTube video after the app is closed on their phones. The new services – YouTube Music and YouTube Premium – is targeted at helping YouTube users experience music streaming and an ad-free experience. “We are excited to launch YouTube Music and Premium in Nigeria, giving fans and artists more opportunity to connect in a dedicated music experience,” says Dan Chalmers, Head of Music, YouTube EMEA. “From your favorite albums to music videos to those remixes and covers you can’t find anywhere else, YouTube Music is your personal guide through the complete world of music,” he added. YouTube Music is a music streaming service that offers official songs, albums, thousands of playlists and artist radio, plus YouTube’s catalogue of remixes, live performances, covers and music videos that you can’t find anywhere else – personalised and organised in one place. While the YouTube Premium is to offer an ad-free experience to users, at the same time opening up a better user experience by allowing users to continue playing a YouTube video after the app is closed even when the phone is locked. It also allows offline streaming through downloads of all videos on YouTube. The new YouTube Music app is available to download from the Play Store and App Store while users can sign up for YouTube Premium at youtube.com/premium. “It’s good that YouTube Music and Premium are in Nigeria now, we need it,” says Naira Marley who was present at the launch. “This platform is going to make things easier for me to listen to my favorite tunes, and it’s also a nice way for me to build more fans in Nigeria and across the globe. It’s about time, Youtube is more than videos, Youtube is the plug.” Music fans can get one month free YouTube Music Premium costing N900 per month thereafter or N1,400 per month for a Family Plan. For YouTube Premium, users will get free for one month, but a month subscription costs N1,100 per month or N1,700 per month for a Family Plan.
