According to the report by TMZ, it’s unclear how the man bypassed security measures on the grounds to get to Ariana’s door, but immediately he did, the police were called. Law enforcement sources claim responding officers found the man near the house, and while arresting him, he allegedly spat on one of the cops. Officers also allegedly found a love note to Ariana, which included directions to her house. The man was booked for misdemeanour trespassing, as well as felony battery for the alleged spitting incident. The incident comes on the heels of another someone calling 911 earlier this month claiming shots were being fired on Ariana’s property. This will not be the first incident where fans would be obsessed over a celebrity. Sometimes last year, a fan of Cyrus made it a point of duty to impregnate her. David Rumsey, 42, was detained by police at the pop star’s iHeartRadio gig at the T-Mobile Arena staff recognised him in the audience from a photograph they’d received from Miley’s security guards earlier that evening. The 26-year-old singer’s team were already on the lookout for David as he’d been sending a number of concerning tweets to the ‘Wrecking Ball’ hitmaker. Some of the messages – which were sent over the course of a few months – included plans for the two of them to “party it up with 2pac, biggie, Prince, Michael Jackson and all those we lost” and told her where to find him after the show.
