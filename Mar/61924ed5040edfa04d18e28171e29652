The Chairman of the 19 Northern Governors’ Forum and Plateau State Governor, Simon Bako Lalong, has felicitated with the former Minister of Defence and Chairman, Joint Chief of Staff, Nigerian Armed Forces, General Domkat Bali, as he clocks 80. A statement by the governor’s Director of Press and Public Affairs, Dr. Makut Simon Macham, said the governor congratulated the General and described him as “a personality, who has given his best to the nation through his years of distinguished military career and service to Nigeria.” Lalong said General Bali has remained a pride to the military institution, Plateau State and the nation at large, as he had served as pioneer Commander, Command and Staff College, Jaji, Kaduna State, as well as member of the Supreme Military Council in the Armed Forces Ruling Council. He said Bali’s track records have remained an inspiration to many younger ones, particularly those making sacrifices to defend the territorial integrity of Nigeria from the threats of insurgency, banditry and terrorism. Lalong thanked him for serving Plateau in many ways and for contributing to the development of the state and its institutions.He prayed God to grant him more years of good health and happiness, while appealing to him not to relent in offering his wisdom to the nation and Plateau State at this time when the challenges of insecurity are being tackled.
