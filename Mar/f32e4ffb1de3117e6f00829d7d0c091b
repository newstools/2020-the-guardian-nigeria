The Court of Appeal, Lagos has affirmed the judgment of a Lagos High Court, Igbosere which dethroned Michael Onakoya as the traditional ruler and Orijeru of Igbooye land, Epe, Lagos. 
   
The king had approached the Court of Appeal and sought the order of the court to set aside the judgment of the lower court, which dethroned him and was delivered April 19, 2016, by Justice Iyabo Kasali.
   
But the three-man panel of the appellate court, Justice Mohammad Lawal, presiding, Justice Ugochukwu Ogakwu and Justice Jamilu Tukur, in a unanimous decision, dismissed the appeal filed by the deposed monarch.  The Lagos State Government had on May 17, 2016, banished the deposed monarch from Igbooye town following the two judgments by Justice Habib Abiru delivered October 2008 and Justice Iyabo Kasali delivered April 2016 after his dethronement as the Orijeru of Igbooyeland, Epe.
   
The letter banishing Onakoya from Igbooye, Epe was signed by the then Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Local Government and Community Affairs, Sanuth J.A.B. and also ordered him to stop parading himself as the Orijeru of Igbooye until another judgment setting aside the two judgments of the High Court.
   
The letter advised him to stay away from the community in order to prevent any breakdown of law and order until the situation is reversed.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
