Participants at the ceremony Members of Gaskiya College Old Students’ Association (GACOSA) have urged the government to raise education quality in the country. The call was made at the school’s 57th anniversary ceremony, which took place recently. The event also featured the swearing- in of new executive officers the run the affairs of the association. The new President, Mrs. Koin Selepreye, who belongs to1991 set, regretted that unlike what obtained in the 90’s, the standard of education has fallen and that has become a cause for worry for the alumni.
She said:” Education standard has really fallen. In 1991, education was purely run by the government and the standard was high. Then, we used to have 30 or 32 students in the class, but now, you have over 100 in one class. In such classes, it is only those in the front that can listen to the teacher, others at the back end up playing. They are overcrowded.” “ I urge the government to formulate policies that include employing only qualified and trained teachers. There should be fewer students in a class. Mores schools should be built and some should be expanded to accommodate more pupils. Other social amenities should be provided and upgraded…” Selepreye added that the association under her watch, would look into how the association could assist in improving facilities in the school. She said: “We will motivate students to do well and help improve the environment of the school…” Other events to mark the anniversary included football novelty matches and cultural displays.
