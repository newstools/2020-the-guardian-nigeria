Ekiti State governor Kayode Fayemi has said he has no intentions of contesting for president when Nigeria heads to poll in 2023. Fayemi’s media aide Segun Dipe in a statement said the news making rounds resulted from Fayemi’s personality and the good relationship he maintains with almost state governors. Dipe said his principal enjoys such relationship due to his current position as governor of Ekiti and chairman of the governors forum which his objective is to engage in “processes such as negotiation, mediation, conciliation, and arbitration.” “Fayemi is a sitting governor and he chairs the Nigeria Governors’ Forum. He enjoys these roles and he is playing them to the best of his ability,” Dipe said. “As a bridge builder, Fayemi is never pushy; he just wants everyone around him to find peace and achieve happiness. The governor no doubt knows a lot of people and doesn’t fail to bring everybody together; he listens carefully and is sincerely interested in how everyone is doing,” he added. Nigeria is expected to vote in another president in 2023 while the two term tenure of President Muhammadu Buhari expires. With expectations that the presidency might be zoned to the southern part of Nigeria, Fayemi, one of the South West states governor, might be a candidate for the office. Fayemi is also a member of the ruling party, All Progressives Congress.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
