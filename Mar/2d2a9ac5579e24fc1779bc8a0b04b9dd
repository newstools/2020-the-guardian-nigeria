The governor said this while receiving the leadership of Yoruba Unity Forum who was on a courtesy visit to his office on Wednesday in Osogbo. According to Oyetola, the critical security need of the entire zone at a point is creating avoidable fear for intending visitors to the region, thus necessitating the creation of the security outfit. “I will like to commend the entire Yoruba nation for standing up in support of the establishment of Amotekun. “The support has created an incentive and encouragement for it to stay. “I can assure you that Amotekun has come to stay and the entire zone is secure,” Oyetola said.
Speaking earlier, the Chairman of the forum, Archbishop Ayo Ladigbolu, applauded Oyetola for prioritising security of lives and property of the citizens. Ladigbolu said that with the establishment of Amotekun for the security of the entire zone, Oyetola and his colleagues in
the South-West had assured the Yoruba nation that the good old days were here again. “We cannot forget to congratulate you and your brother governors on the successful establishment of Amotekun. This has rekindled our hope that the good old days are here again. The good old days when the region could mobilise resources to take care of the people and the youth could organise themselves to engage in meaningful competition towards the protection of the zone”, Ladigbolu said. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the Houses of Assembly of Osun, Oyo, Ondo, Ogun and Lagos states had, on Tuesday, passed Amotekun bills into law.
