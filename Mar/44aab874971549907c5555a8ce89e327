(Photo by Ludovic MARIN / AFP)  October’s election is a major challenge for the Ivory Coast after its 2010-2011 ballot ended in violence between political rivals that killed 3,000 people. “I would like to solemnly announce that I will not be a candidate in the October 31, 2020, presidential election and I will transfer power to the younger generation,” Ouattara said in a speech to Congress. Ouattara, first elected in 2010 and then re-elected in 2015, had kept Ivorians guessing over his political future, saying last year that he could run again if his traditional rivals were candidates. Ouattara in 2010-11 ousted the then-president, Laurent Gbagbo, who refused to step down after losing elections in a standoff that triggered violent street clashes.
