The Chief Executive Officer, Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC), Babatunde Irukera, has restated its mandate to protect the general public, stressing that hospitals do not require police report to attend to emergency cases. According to him, the FCCPC, Federal Ministry of Health and other relevant stakeholders have developed the Patients’ Bill of Rights for the protection of healthcare consumers. Irukera at the public inquiry on the possible violation of patients’ right leading to the death of Miss Moradeun Balogun in Lagos said one of the laws of the FCCPC is to conduct investigations of public concerns. He said appropriate medical intervention to patients who present with emergencies especially when law enforcement is implicated continues to be a problem in the country. “In spite of the fact that there is a law, the Nigerian police has repeatedly issued different directives and protocol and for the fact that we in FCCPC created a Patients’ Bill of Right this continues to be the biggest problem and sadly almost every time this leads to unfortunate and needless loss of life,” FCCPC boss said. Irukera disclosed that it is important to take different approach to tackle the issue because they have done laws and sensitisation programme but it continues to be a problem. He charged the public to become aware on the prevailing law and situation in respect to how they could be treated when presented with medical emergency even if there is potential criminal issue.
