Deposed Kano emir Muhammadu Sanusi is likely to leave Awe, a community in Nassarawa State, where he is exiled by the Kano State Government. Sanusi has been resident in the community for over four days since the Kano Government dethroned him and consequently evicted him from the palace. The deposed emir has been kept in the community in the company of security operatives. However, The Guardian correspondent gathered that all is set for Sanusi to leave the apartment with Kaduna State governor Nasir El-Rufai, who visited him. The Guardian gathered that the deposed emir’s luggage has been packed and all-set to depart the community. His destination is yet unknown. This comes after a Federal High Court in Abuja on Friday ordered the release of Sanusi from detention in Awe. The judge Justice Anwuli Chikere granted the interim order following an ex parte application moved by Sanusi’s lawyer Lateef Fagbemi (SAN). The judge also ordered that the order for the release of the deposed monarch should be served on the respondents to the application. The respondents are the Inspector-General of Police, Muhammed Adamu; the Director-General of the Department of State Service, Yusuf Bichi; the Attorney-General of Kano State, Ibrahim Muktar, and the Attorney-General of the Federation, Mr. Abubakar Malami (SAN). Sanusi, accompanied by El-Rufai, had earlier on Friday led a Juma’at prayer at the Awe central mosque. The prayer lasted from 2:00 pm till 2:44 pm In his sermon, the dethroned emir Sanusi called on Muslim fellows to always trust in God whatever they face in life because nothing is above His power.
