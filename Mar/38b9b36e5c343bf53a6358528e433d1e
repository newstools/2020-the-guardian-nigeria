The Ondo State government has debunked the story in the social media as untrue and misleading that the convoy of Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu hit a motorcyclist. It was gathered that the governor’s convoy allegedly killed a 42-year-old man identified as Jimoh Adams in Owo, the headquarters of Owo Local Council of the state and hometown of the governor. But the state’s Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Mr. Donald Ojogo, swiftly denied the allegation, saying: “It is untrue that the convoy of the governor, Oluwarotimi Odunayo Akeredolu, was involved in the accident as ascribed in the report.” Also, the state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Mr. Tee-Leo Ikoro, when contacted, disclosed that investigation showed that the governor’s convoy did not hit the deceased motorcyclist. Ikoro, who noted that he visited the accident scene to get first hand information about the incident, said: “It is good to correct the impression on the social media. Journalism is about factual reportage. “I went with some journalists. The car involved was parked and the cyclist rammed into a stationery vehicle. It is wrong for people to say it was the governor’s convoy. The vehicle is with us for proper investigation. “This clarification becomes pertinent in view of the misleading narrative that has trailed the unfortunate death of a motorcyclist who had collision with a stationary vehicle. “This, without prejudice to police investigation, is the outcome of our preliminary probe on the heels of the anxiety understandably generated by the deliberate news slant.” The commissioner has, however, condoled with the family of the deceased, saying: “Governor Akeredolu sympathises with the family of the deceased and prays God for the repose of his soul.” “This incident, unfortunate and avoidable as it seems, underscores the need for caution on our highways.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
