The Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), Nasarawa State Command, has arrested four persons for examination malpractice in three local councils of the state. Its Commandant, Alhaji Mahmud Fari, who disclosed this in Lafia, yesterday, during a press briefing, added that the four persons were arrested at various Joint Admission and Matriculation Board (JAMB) Computer Based Tests (CBT) centres in Karu, Akwanga and Lafia Councils. “These are our leaders of tomorrow, but have decided to become criminal at this tender age. We are taking them to the court of law where they must go and face the consequences of their actions. “We cannot allow this to continue, if we do, then we are saying we want Nigeria to collapse, because if they start committing crime at this stage, what will happen if they grow older and become the leaders?” he said. Fari said NSCDC would continue to support JAMB to rid examination centres of criminal-minded persons, because supervising examinations is one of the mandates of the NSCDC, adding: “Some of them were hired to write for others, while some didn’t register. But investigation is going on to get to the root of what they did. “One of them was arrested in Masaka in Karu Council, two were arrested in Akwanga Council, while the fourth person was arrested in Lafia Council,” he stated. Fari urged youths to obey the law and avoid any incident or act that is against the law. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
