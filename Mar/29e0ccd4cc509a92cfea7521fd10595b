Players infected include Italian forward Patrick Cutrone, Argentine German Pezzella and Serbia forward Dusan Vlahovic. As a result the Tuscany side have launched a fundraiser to help city hospitals with former France midfielder Franck Ribery donating 50,000 euros ($54,000). “I want to thank Ribery for his donation,” said Commisso. “We’ve started well, we’ve already raised 420,000 euros with a target of 500,000.” Serie A rivals Brescia also confirmed two employees had tested positive for COVID-19 which has killed nearly 3,000 people in Italy.
