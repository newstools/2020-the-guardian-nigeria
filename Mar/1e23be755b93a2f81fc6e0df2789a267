The Nigerian government on Wednesday suspended its visa on arrival policy over fears of further spread of coronavirus. The Secretary to the Government of the Federation Boss Mustapha made the announcement at a media briefing on Wednesday. Nigeria also placed a travel ban on 13 countries with a high prevalence of the virus. The banned countries are the United State of America, the United Kingdom, China, Japan, Iran, Switzerland, Norway, Netherland, France, South Korea, Germany, Italy and Spain. Mustapha’s announcement of the travel ban and a halt to the issuance of Nigeria visa on arrival cames after the country’s health minister confirmed that there were five new cases of coronavirus in the country– one Ekiti State and four in Lagos State. Nigeria’s visa policy was first presented by President Buhari on Tuesday, February 4 2020, at the Council chambers of the Presidential Villa, Abuja. The policy, according to Buhari, was announced to attract innovation, specialised skills and knowledge from abroad to complement local capacity in Nigeria. “The new visa policy provides an avenue to achieve African integration by the introduction of visas on arrival for short visits to Nigeria for holders of passports of African Union (AU) countries,” Buhari. The figure of coronavirus in Nigeria currently stands at 8 as confirmed by the federal health ministry and the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC).
