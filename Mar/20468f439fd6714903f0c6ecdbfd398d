- Receives N28.5m donation from UBA Ondo State Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu has ordered the total closure of all markets across the 18 local councils of the state as part of the frantic moves to forestall the outbreak of Coronavirus in the state. The Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Mr. Donald Ojogo, who disclosed this in a statement made available to journalists in Akure yesterday, expressed dissatisfaction over the disregard of the earlier directive given by the state government. “It has been observed, however, that residents have flagrantly disobeyed this directive, which is a potent measure to avoid the spread of COVID-19 pandemic. “Compelled by this unwholesome infraction, the government hereby places a total ban on all markets across Ondo State with effect from today, March 31, 2020. “This ban is irrespective of any item. For emphasis, all markets must remain closed until further notice,” the statement said. Meanwhile, as part of its contribution to the fight against the global pandemic COVID-19, the United Bank for Africa Plc (UBA), through the UBA Foundation, has donated N28.5 million to the state government. The Regional Head of the bank, Mr. Olurotimi Obagaye, while presenting the cheque to the governor at the Governor’s Office yesterday, said that the donation would go a long way in helping the state in the fight against Coronavirus. Obagaye, who commended the efforts of the state government to guard against an outbreak in the state, prayed to the Almighty God to have mercy on the world. Akeredolu thanked the UBA Foundation and Tony Elemelu for the generous donation, saying the bank had done well for the country and Africa at large with the large sum of money donated and shared among states.
