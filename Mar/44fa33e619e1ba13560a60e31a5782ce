The deadline for filing of annual returns for individual taxpayers including self-employed persons in Lagos State has been extended by two months. Lagos State Internal Revenue Service boss Ayodele Subair said the extension of the deadline from March 31 to May 31, is in response to appeals made by taxpayers as well as a policy shift by the agency to assuage the effect of COVID-19 on the taxpayers and residents of Lagos State. “We implore the taxpayers to access our eTax platform for all tax operations and administration matters, including filing of annual returns from the comfort of their homes and offices,” Subair said. “They can do this, by simply logging on to the eTax platform via https://etax.lirs.net or calling our Customer Care Centre on 0700 CALL LIRS (070022555477),” he concluded.
