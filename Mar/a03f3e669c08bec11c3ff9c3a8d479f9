Jamilu regretted the embarrassment his actions must have caused the President, his host, Governor Abubakar Bagudu and other dignitaries present at the event, pointing out that his passion for Buhari’s integrity and purposeful leadership made him behave the way he did by struggling to see him, urging Nigerians to disregard the reports, saying “the allegations are false. I was not beaten up and I am doing fine.” Jamilu apologised to the security agents for breaching the protocol, adding that he had no intention of harming the President, adding: “He is my President and I love him so much.” Also speaking, Bagudu said Jamilu had nothing against the President, as he was interested in his actions. Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, appealed to the media to verify their report before going on air, insisting that Jamilu was doing fine and not a member of Boko Haram or any other religions sect.
