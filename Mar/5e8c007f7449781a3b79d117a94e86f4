The University of Lagos (UNILAG) chapter of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) on Wednesday passed a vote of no confidence on the Pro-Chancellor and Chairman of the Governing Council, Dr Wale Babalakin. Speaking at a congress, Unilag’s ASUU chairman Dr Dele Ashiru said, “Dr Wale Babalakin is now a persona non grata on our campus.” “We are asking the Federal Government to remove Babalakin as Pro-Chancellor because our union is going to enforce that resolution. Babalakin cannot be seen anywhere on this campus from today. “We want him removed for deliberately misinforming the Ministry of Education which led to the cancellation of our convocation. His prayer to the ministry was that Council did not approve the convocation. Available evidence in the minutes states that the Council during its January 21 and 22 meeting was informed about the convocation and approved the budget for the convocation. “We don’t want to see him again anywhere in the university. He is no longer needed.” There had been a conflict of interest between Babalakin and the management of the university. The unresolved crisis led to the suspension of the university’s 51st convocation on Monday, March 11 2020. The Ministry of Education and the Nigerian University Commission (NUC) had advised the postponement following an allegation by the Pro-Chancellor that the management failed to obtain the approval of the institution’s council. On suspended convocation, Ashiru said the members viewed the postponement as “wicked, inhuman, egoistic, retrogressive, unconscionable and satanic.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
