The Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Directorate of Roads Traffic Services (DRTS), also known as Vehicle Inspection Office (VIO), yesterday, advised drivers to desist from accommodating more than three passengers in their cars. VIO Head of Public Relations, Kalu Emetu, who gave this warning during a sensitisation for drivers in the territory, stressed the need for drivers to carry two passengers at the back and one in the front, as directed by the government to stem further spread of Coronavirus currently ravaging the world.

Emetu said: “Starting from tomorrow, our men will be on the ground and any driver carrying more than two persons behind, will be forced to drop one person and if the person has paid, his money will be refunded immediately. “The enforcement to the new directive will take effect from tomorrow because all over the world, we know the virus and the way it affects people. One of the ways to correct it is a total distancing that is why we are talking about social spacing.” Recalling that the federal government within the week, went on air to sensitise the public on the need not to carry more than three passengers, Emetu regretted that most of the motorists were not complying with the directive, saying the DST was doing all it could as a stakeholder to assist in curtailing the virus.
