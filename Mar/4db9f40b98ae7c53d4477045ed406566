Four of the most popular wedding venues in Las Vegas are no longer booming in the face of the fast-spreading coronavirus with lots of would-be brides and grooms telling them they’re too scared to go through with their destination weddings. In a report by TMZ, Vegas Wedding said they’ve had couples saying they made their decision over fears of contracting coronavirus. One bride cited her weakened immune system, saying travel and crowds are not worth the risk. Another family also bailed over travel fears. Also, Ditto Wedding Chapel complains that things are deathly slow and the European travel ban is already forcing last-minute cancellations. Viva Las Vegas Wedding is getting at least 3 cancelations a day, while some couples say they’re still coming because they won’t let the virus ruin their lives. The chapels are dealing with the same issues and working overtime to keep things sanitized and even Elvis Presley impersonators are feeling the effects. The virus has affected almost all activities around the world. Football games, meetings, conferences and so on.
