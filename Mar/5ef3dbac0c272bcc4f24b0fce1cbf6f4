The policemen deployed to the palace in the wake of Sanusi’s removal sealed off the entrance to the palace. Hundreds of Kano residents were also seen gathering close to the palace of the deposed emir, whose palace guards were said to have been withdrawn. Relatives and some confidantes, like Dr Bashir Aliyu, the chief Imam of Alfurqan Mosque, were among those with him at the time of his dethronement. Secretary to the state government Usman Alhaji announced Sanusi’s removal on Monday at the State Executive Council meeting which held at the Government House in Kano. Alhaji said the removal was with immediate effect. Alhaji explained that the state government took the decision to remove the traditional ruler over allegations of consistently refusing to abide by instructions given to him. Besides, security at the entrances to Kano State Government House and the state house of assembly have been beefed up, apparently to forestall protest. Although Governor Ganduje is presently presiding over emergency security meeting, a credible source at the Government House told our correspondent that Ganduje is set to announce new emir. The source revealed that Alhaji Aminu Ado Bayero, son of the late emir of Kano and the current emir of Bichi may be announced as Sanusi’s successor.
