Poland’s Environment Minister Michal Wos said Monday he was under quarantine after testing positive for the novel coronavirus, adding that he was feeling fine. Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki was among the 15 government members under self-quarantine on Tuesday, along with the ministers of health, defence, interior, justice and culture, Dworczyk said. Government members were all “working remotely”, he added. A nation of 38 million people, Poland was among the first EU members to introduce sweeping measures to contain the spread of the deadly novel coronavirus, including shutting its borders to foreign travellers, closing schools and urging citizens to stay home. It had 205 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including five deaths, as of Tuesday morning, with the health ministry warning cases could rise above 1,000 this week.
