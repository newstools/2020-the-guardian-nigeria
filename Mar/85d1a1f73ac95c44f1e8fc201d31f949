The Presidential Amnesty Programme (PAP) has raised the alarm over the activities of fraudulent individuals and syndicates soliciting financial rewards for a recently advertised contract verification scheduled for between March 9, 2020 and April 10, 2020. This followed reports that some unscrupulous individuals and syndicates were seeking monetary rewards from contractors with a promise to influence the outcome of the verification or cause companies to be listed for verification. A statement issued by the PAP’s Special Assistant on Media, Murphy Ganagana, reads, “The PAP wishes to emphasise that all companies listed in a notice published in national dailies of Wednesday, March 4, 2020, are to forward their documents and claims in a letter addressed to the Presidential Amnesty Programme head office on 37A Nile Street, Maitama, Abuja. “Since the Amnesty Programme has put in place a transparent process for verification of contracts, no third parties have been assigned to discuss, negotiate or promise payments or receive gratification on behalf of the PAP. “Any individual or group that seeks to fraudulently benefit from the contract verification will be investigated and prosecuted.” It stressed that all beneficiaries, contractors and consultants of the programme are encouraged to take advantage of the exercise and cooperate to ensure that the objectives of the programme were achieved.
