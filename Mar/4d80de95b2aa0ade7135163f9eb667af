The country’s death toll from the outbreak climbed to 288 on Sunday from at least 183, while the total number of cases rose to 7,753 from 5,753. The wife of Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez is among those who have tested positive for the novel coronavirus, his office said late Saturday, just hours after he announced the lockdown. Both Begona Gomez and her husband were well, and were at their official residence following the new measures introduced by the health authorities, said a government statement. The measures were introduced as part of a 15-day state of emergency officially declared by his government on Saturday. It is only the second time that the government has evoked it since the country returned to democracy following the death of dictator Francisco Franco in 1975. The other time was during a 2010 air traffic controllers’ strike. Sanchez warned Friday that the number of infections could reach 10,000 in the coming days in Spain.
