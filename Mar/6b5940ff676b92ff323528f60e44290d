The Association of Professional Women Engineers (APWEN), Ilorin Chapter, has urged government at all levels and well-meaning Nigerians to promote equal opportunities for women and quality. Chairman of the association, Mrs. Oluwatoyin Babatunde, advocated that girls should be encouraged to take careers in sciences, technologies and engineering as part of the strategies to close the gender gap. Babatunde, who works with the Lower Niger River Basin Authority in Ilorin, Kwara State, said women had contributed immensely and in diverse ways to the development of each country and they should be celebrated. She said that the theme for the International Women Day 2020 celebration, “I am Generation Equality,” was in line with the vision of APWEN, which is to encourage women to achieve professional excellence as engineers and to encourage the study of engineering by the girl-child. Babatunde said that gender equality is not a women’s issue but a world issue, which promotes a gender-equal world for a healthier, wealthier and more harmonious environment. Meanwhile, to celebrate women, members of APWEN in Kwara State had a health/awareness walk last Saturday to encourage regular exercise and professional excellence among women, create awareness for the populace on the need to take safety precautions against Coronavirus19 and to increase awareness on the need to encourage the girl-child to study engineering. “The Federal Government should encourage more girls in the study of science and engineering by training more female teachers in STEM (Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics). They should teach these girls and lay their hands on innovations. “The future of Nigeria depends on the innovations of our students. The International Women’s Day (IWD) is a day set aside to celebrate women’s achievements worldwide,” she said. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
