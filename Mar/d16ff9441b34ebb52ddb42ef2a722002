Odion Ighalo is a Nigerian footballer. In 2014, he made his debut for the English club with Watford where he scored his first goal in the Championship against Brentford on 30 September by tucking the ball home after his initial penalty was saved by David Button, in a 2–1 home win. On 31 January 2020, Ighalo returned to the Premier League, joining Manchester United on loan until the end of the season. In doing so, he became the first Nigerian player, and only the seventh African, to join the club. After the move was confirmed, Ighalo revealed that he had taken a pay cut to make the move happen, calling it a “dream” to join the club he has long supported. He opted to wear the number 25 shirt, previously worn by Antonio Valencia. However, Kenyans on twitter are claiming the footballer is from Kenya and Nigerians are not having this. Below are some of the reactions: Ighalo is the first Kenyan to score a brace for Manchester united. Keep winning
