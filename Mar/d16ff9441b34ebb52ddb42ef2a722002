Odion Ighalo is a Nigerian footballer. In 2014, he made his debut for the English club with Watford where he scored his first goal in the Championship against Brentford on 30 September by tucking the ball home after his initial penalty was saved by David Button, in a 2–1 home win. On 31 January 2020, Ighalo returned to the Premier League, joining Manchester United on loan until the end of the season.
