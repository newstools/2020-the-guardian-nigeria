Dare donates sanitizers, handwashers Sports Minister, Sunday Dare has ordered all the National Stadiums in Lagos, Abuja, Kaduna and Ibadan shut to public as a means of curbing the spread of the coronavirus, also known as COVID-19. The minister, who has also banned all sporting activities across the country to mitigate the spread of the virus, has advised Nigerian youths to adhere strictly to safety measures put in place by the Federal Government. The Federal Government had called off the National Sports Festival as a result of the pandemic, just as the weekly Federal Executive Council meeting was suspended, while workers from levels 12 and below have been directed to work from home.
Only on Tuesday, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) had postponed the 2020 Tokyo Olympics till 2021 as a result of the spread of the virus. Dare, who has been at the forefront of the fight against the virus, yesterday donated hand sanitisers, handwashers and other sanitary materials to staff of his ministry and the adjourning communities in the Federal Capital Territory. Dare said the gesture was to help prevent the spread of the virus by ensuring that people adhered to hygienic instructions. “We have a responsibility to help fight against the spread of COVID-19 by maintaining simple hygiene of hand washing, sanitizing our hands and maintaining social distance. “We must be our brother’s keepers at a time like this. We must lend support to those infected and prevent further spread through consistent enlightenment and education. “We cannot take anything for granted. All hands must be on deck to fight this scourge. The Federal Government through the Ministry of Health and other agencies are doing everything possible to manage the spread of the virus. We have a responsibility to lend support to these efforts.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
