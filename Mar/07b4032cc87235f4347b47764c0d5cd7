Kaduna State Government has announced restrictions on religious services, social events and all large gatherings in the state as an attempt to contain the spread of coronavirus. “As part of measures to protect residents from, and slow down the spread of the coronavirus disease, the Kaduna State Government is restricting religious services, social events and all large gatherings,” the state government said on Friday. “While no case of Covid-19 has been reported in the state so far, the government has a duty to work with all our leaders and residents of our state to jointly ensure that everything is done to reduce the chance of the disease taking root and spreading in the state,” it added. Authorities advised Muslim clerics “not to hold Juma’at services today” and also advised, “other means of worship and fellowship should be adopted in much smaller numbers of not more than 10 persons, for now.” Nigeria, like many other countries in the world, is trying to stop the spread of the virus. Nigeria has since confirmed 12 positive cases and all are still under medical care. The Nigerian government have put in place measures to stop the spread of the virus including social distancing, self-isolation, closure of schools. Earlier in the week, Nigeria announced that it will not welcome flights from 13 countries including South Korea, the United States, the United Kingdom, China and Italy.
