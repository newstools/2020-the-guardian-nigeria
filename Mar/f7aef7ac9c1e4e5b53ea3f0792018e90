There are indications that the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) state chairmen Forum appear to be divided on the issue of the suspension order slammed on the party’s national chairman, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole. The Publicity Secretary of the forum, Mr Lawal Liman, on Tuesday dissociated self from what he termed ‘the fraudulent vote of confidence” passed on Oshiomhole by the forum Chairman, Ali Bukar Dalori and the Secretary, Dr. Ben Nwoye on Monday. Assuring that the forum would meet before the NEC meeting, scheduled for next week, Tuesday, 17th March on the issue, Liman claimed that it was untrue that states chairmen actually met in Abuja and endorsed Oshiomhole continuous stay in office. He claimed that he had been inundated with calls by some Chairmen calling him to find out the veracity of the statement. He noted: “l have told them that no such thing happened and that they should disregard the statement. We had agreed, in the past, that nobody should issue a statement, in the name of the Forum, if the chairmen had not met and accepted the release of such statements.” Enjoining Party Members to wait for the outcome of pending Court cases on the issue of Oshiomhole suspension, he expressed optimism that the crisis, rocking the Party would soon be resolved. “I want to confirm to my colleagues that there was no meeting held and there was no statement issued to pass a Vote of Confidence on the National Chairman. “All issues would be resolved at the next NEC meeting and, hopefully, we will hold a meeting of the Forum before the said NEC meeting. We will not, in any way, bring the name of the Forum to disrepute by doing what will take away our credibility”.
