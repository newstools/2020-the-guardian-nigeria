Following the accident in which six workers of Okomu Oil Palm Company died, stakeholders, victims’ families, and host communities at the weekend sent condolence messages and prayed for the repose of the souls of the deceased. They also commiserated with the management and staff of the company over the loss. The stakeholders said they were touched by the news of the tragedy, especially given the fact that the company was safety conscious. Speaking during his visit, Chairman, Ovia southwest Council Area, Destiny Enabulele, said he was deeply touched by the accident, because Okomu Oil has been a good partner and that some of those who died were indigenes of the area. While appreciating Enabulele for his visit and concern, Managing Director of Okomu Oil Palm Company Plc., Dr. Graham Hefer, noted that many stakeholders have either called or visited to commiserate with him on the death of his employees. “Very recently the Conservator of the National Park and his team visited the company to commiserate with me including the Esogban of Benin Kingdom, Chief Edebiri, Iyase of Udo, and many other Nigerian stakeholders and foreign investors from Brussels and Switzerland,” Hefer said. He pointed out that accident and the contingent solidarity shown by everyone has shown that the world was a global village where what touches one, touches all. Hefer thanked all the stakeholders for their concern, support, and encouragement, which have gone a long way to strengthen the management and staff members at this sad moment in the company’s history.
