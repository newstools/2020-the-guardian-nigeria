This comes days after her vagina rejuvenation where she stated that it boosted her body confidence and love life. In her words: Hi guys, before any speculation starts I’d like to let people know that Jermaine and I are no longer in a relationship. We have spent 9 years together with ups and downs but ultimately we couldn’t make it work. I will always care for Jermaine and wish him the best but at this point, all avenues have been explored to make the marriage work and sometimes things just aren’t meant to be. There is no drama, scandal animosity or bitterness just two people who’s journey has come to an end together. We have made this decision mutually and we are both looking forward to what the next chapter has in store. Jermaine also made this announcement on his Instagram story, he writes: After 9 years together and nearly 6 years married, Alice and I have decided to separate. I will always love Alice, but we’ve decided to head our separate ways. There is no drama, and we will always remain close friends. This will not be the first time the duo will be having issues in their marriage. They briefly split in 2018 after Jermaine and on a TV show called Celebs Go Dating, they discussed these issues. Jermaine is said to have dropped a flirty comment on model Chloe Ayling’s Instagram. In his words: I was on a show and a scenario occurred where I was flirting. I overstepped the mark a little bit and wasn’t thinking about the consequences. I said I wasn’t married. Alica also was not opened to the idea of having a baby even though Jermaine wanted it. Following their dinner on Celebs Go Dating, Alice appeared open to “practicing” for babies after placing Jermaine in the good books. The couple has been together for nine years.
