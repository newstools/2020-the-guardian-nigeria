MGI has also declared that Nigerian players across the federation would also be participating at the World Scrabble Championship to show the world that the country is still the number one in the game. Lukman Owolabi, who is the convener of the event, said all arrangements have already been made for the biggest scrabble event in Nigeria. He noted that the event is aimed at creating more awareness of the game in Nigeria. “Top countries in scrabble, including the U.K., U.S., Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, Kenya, Zambia and others will be in Nigeria in September for the maiden World Scrabble Classics. As Nigeria remains the number one scrabble nation in the world, it is vital for a world championship to take place here so that Nigerian scrabble players, who have not gotten the opportunity to compete at the big stage, have the experience. “We thank some of our sponsors, Loense International LTD, FPC Couture, Pan African Sports, D’Podium Intl Event Centre and Prediction Kings for their support in ensuring the development of scrabble in Nigeria. “We expect all the scrabble players in Nigeria to turn out for the championship,” he said.
