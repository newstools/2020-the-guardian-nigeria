AT THE END OF THE 15 DAY PERIOD, WE WILL MAKE A DECISION AS TO WHICH WAY WE WANT TO GO!” Trump tweeted overnight. The 15 day period he refers to was started last Monday, setting in motion a series of federal recommendations on social distancing and other anti-coronavirus measures. It concludes a week from Tuesday. Health officials and state governors dealing with the worst outbreaks of the novel coronavirus have said they expect mass restrictions on the movement of people, shutting down much of the US economy, will have to continue for some time. But Trump also retweeted early Monday several calls for a quick shift in strategy. “15 days. Then we isolate the high-risk groups and the rest of us get back to work before it’s all over for everyone!! #Landslide2020,” said one retweet on the president’s Twitter. “Correct. 15 days, then we keep the high-risk groups protected as necessary and the rest of us go back to work,” read another.
