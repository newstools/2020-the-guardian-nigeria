To Enlist Over 700 Lawyers A group, the Youths Empowerment for Justice Initiative (YEJI) has condemned incessant, illegal arrests and abuse of citizens’ rights by security agencies, saying it would deploy over 700 legal practitioners nationwide to stem the menace. Its director of legal service, Mrs. Florence Wogu, who spoke during the inauguration of the group’s Justice Committee in Abuja, said the nation’s correctional centres are overcrowded due to illegal detention and delay in the administration of justice. She said: “If SARS have decided to focus on the youth because they hold very expensive phones, have laptops in their bags, for crying out loud, the new generation today use laptops. SARS is getting it wrong. It is true that there are youths that are going off track, but the umbrella action of arresting everybody is wrong.” Chairman, Board of Trustees (BOT), Chief Robert Opara, said the 700 legal practitioners would be mobilised effectively to go to different correctional centres, adding that each state of the federation, including the nation’s capital, would have a minimum of 10 lawyers.
