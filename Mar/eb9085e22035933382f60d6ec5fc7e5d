President Muhammadu Buhari has commissioned ‘Operation Swift Response’ as a border drill exercise to checkmate the illegal activities of smugglers across the borders. In a statement signed yesterday, by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, Buhari said the decision was part of Federal Government’s effort to ensure food security and improve local production of goods at competitive prices. The border drill has been hugely successful and has led to the interception and seizure of large quantities of food, materials, minerals and petroleum resources illegally trafficked across the borders. He, however, expressed dismay that 295 smuggled petroleum tankers were released without due authorisation on December 17, 2019 by some security officials, charged with the responsibility of protecting borders. Sequel to this act, the National Security Adviser (NSA) was directed to set up a Board of Inquiry to investigate the crime, and it was recommended to the President that all officials (civilian or security operatives) found to have connived to undermine government’s efforts should be withdrawn from the border drill and sanctioned by their respective organisations.The President has accepted the recommendations and directed the immediate withdrawal and replacement of all those found culpable.
