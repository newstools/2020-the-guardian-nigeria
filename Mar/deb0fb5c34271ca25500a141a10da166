A keen observer of the Nigerian entertainment industry could easily tell that days are gone when men dominated the industry; when major concerts were staged without a single female artiste on the bill. Today, the ladies seem to have found their voices and breaking new grounds. From the likes of Tiwa Savage to Omawumi, Waje, Seyi Shay, Yemi Alade, Teni, Simi, Niniola, Chidinma and others, the story has completely changed. Even in the DJ department, the ladies are not doing badly, with the likes of DJ Cuppy, DJ Nana, DJ K Switch and others giving the guys a run for their money. Indeed, the Amazons have arrived. Just recently, fast rising female singer, Yoyo Ovi, made a noticeable impact on the music scene with the release of her new EP, Fear. With songs such as Soni, Anu, Fear, Danger and Wild, the young music talent has put her right foot forward in looks to be an exciting career. At the listening party, which was staged at the Rhapsody’s, GRA, Ikeja, Lagos, guests had the opportunity of watching the low-cut wearing artiste perform all the songs live on stage, including a couple of remixes she had done in the past. Media marketing company, MediaBX NG, who will be working with Yoyo Ovi going forward, sponsored the listening session. Born Uyoyou Ovririe, Yoyo Ovi released her first single titled Yoyo in 2015. The Afropop artiste, who hails from Delta State, followed her debut single with covers of Evi Edna Ogholi’s hit tracks, Ririovara and Obaro. Thereafter, she released I do and My Way in 2018. She followed up with Soni and Anu in 2019. On the choice of the title for her debut EP, she explained, “Fear is something I had to overcome to become my authentic self. I had to become comfortable with my brand and not afraid to express my sound,” she said. Meanwhile, Soni has been well received by fans since it was released in September 2019. For Yoyo, “Like most of my songs, the single was inspired by an experience from a past relationship. I couldn’t keep up with the lies and low level of commitment,” she revealed. Describing herself as Love Ambassador, Yoyo said she hopes to use her music to send the message of love and to her fans. However, music was actually not on Yoyo’s radar until she won the Glo Rock ‘n’ Rule Beauty Pageant in 2011, where she showcased her singing talent. A graduate of Botany from the University of Calabar, Cross River State, she is now determined to make the best out of her music career, already setting the tone with Fear. “I was born with my singing talent, but it was in 2015 that I dropped my debut single titled Yoyo. I think this was the perfect time to drop my EP; I have been consistently releasing songs over the years since my debut.” On her influence, she said, “I look up to them because of their hard work, dedication and passion with which they have chased their music dreams and made great success. The likes of Tiwa Savage, Davido, Yemi Alade and others.” Of course, her journey in the music industry is not without challenges. “The major challenge is not being signed to a record label yet; that has left me with the sole financial responsibility of the brand, which has not been easy at all, considering all that goes into releasing songs and promoting them to be heard.” Meanwhile, covering Evi Edna’s song was a deliberate decision by Yoyo, who sings with so much confidence in her voice. “Both songs have been my favourites since childhood; it was an honor for me to grow up and make my versions. I did it to remind my generation of the good old days,” she enthused. Asked where she hopes to be in five years, she said, “More Music, making my mark in the Entertainment industry and putting my name on the World Music Map. I will be a global superstar in five years for Sure; God’s Grace is already sufficient for me,” she declared. As for how far she can go in the industry, it’s now a matter of time.
