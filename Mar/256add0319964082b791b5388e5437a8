As women and mothers of the Presbyterian Church of Nigeria celebrate mothering Sunday today, the Women’s Guild Desk Coordinator of the Church, Rev. Mrs. Deborah Emem Akan has congratulated all women and mothers. In her goodwill message, Akan welcomed them to the 2020 Women’s Guild Emphasis Day celebration. She called on mothers to shine as a light of the gospel to the world, especially in dark places. With the General Assembly theme: “Arise and Shine” taken from Isaiah 60:1, the Coordinator said: “This theme connotes that we have been at ease in Zion as Christian women. We have been complacent. While men slept, the enemy sowed tares. A lot of tares have been sown by the enemy resulting in social vices, which have almost become the norm in our contemporary world.” She urged them to arise by accepting Jesus as Lord and Saviour, as well as live their lives in righteousness through grace and consecrate their lives through prayer. She also reminded them to be good examples to their families/flock of Christ and determine to make a lasting impact by touching and building lives by their good deeds. As they hold their Triennial Conference in September 2020 at The City of Light, located between Ekori, Mkpani, and Ugep in Upper Cross Synod, Rev. Akan admonished them saying: “We must make deliberate efforts to raise Godly children that will stand for God and defend our faith. We must show forth our lights by being good examples to our children and wards. “As mothers, God has invested a lot in us to enable us to function in different capacities to give our nation the positive touch it deserves.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
