Ortom Uzodinma swears in 22 commissioners, announces commencement of e-govt
Benue State government has uncovered 3,460 ghost workers on the payroll of the 23 councils in the state. Chairman of the Local Government Service Commission, Dr. Bem Melladu, made this known yesterday when he presented the commission’s report to Governor Samuel Ortom at the Benue People’s House, Makurdi. Melladu said out of 18,426 names on the payroll, only 14,966 turned up for verification. He maintained that the verification equally uncovered names of deceased staff on the payroll, salary padding, redundancy and falsification of retirement dates among other fraudulent practices at the third tier of government in the state. While saying the exercise would help reduce the huge wage bill of the councils and make more funds available for capital projects, he recommended prompt action to sanitise the system. Responding, Governor Ortom assured that the State Executive Council (SEC) would deliberate on the commission’s report in its next meeting. The governor lamented the decay in the local government system, pointing out that his administration would take proactive measures to plug the leakages and reposition the councils. He commended the courage and commitment of the commission’s chairman and his team to the assignment. In Imo State, Governor Hope Uzodinma has sworn in 22 commissioners and scores of aides at the Ahiajoku Convention Centre, New Owerri. Uzodinma, who disclosed that the aides would have their portfolios by tomorrow, said his administration was introducing e-government in the state. He charged the appointees to carry out their duties diligently, not minding their previous relationship with him, noting that the overall interest of the state and nation should be taken uppermost.
