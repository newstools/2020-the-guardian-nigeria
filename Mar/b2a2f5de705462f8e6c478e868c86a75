No fewer than 23 children were yesterday rescued by the Taraba State police command from a suspected child trafficker. The children who were between the ages of four and seven were rescued from a female trafficker whose name was given as Mary Yakubu. Parading the trafficker before newsmen in Jalingo, the police said they were intercepted at a park in Bali local government area of the state while they were about to board a vehicle with the suspect. The suspect, who was also a teacher at Adamu primary school in Bali, was said to have lured the children from their parents on the pretext of making life worthy for them in the city. Admitting to the crime, she claimed the children were given to her by their parents to help those in need of children to take care of. According to her, “the parents of the children told me to come and get them for people who would help cater for their education because in their villages, there are no schools. This is actually the first time I am doing this and I did not collect any money from their parents. I was arrested at the car park in Bali when I was about leaving with the children.” Spokesman of the state police command, David Misal, who paraded the suspect, explained that the 23 children have been handed over to the Ministry of Social Welfare, adding that three parents of some of the children have been arrested in connection with the case, while investigation is still ongoing to get others. He beckoned on parents and guardians who often indulge in such illicit acts to as a matter of urgency desist or be compel to face the wrath of the law.A top official of the ministry, who confirmed to The Guardian that the children were handed over to them, said the ministry is working round the clock to reunite the children with their parents.
