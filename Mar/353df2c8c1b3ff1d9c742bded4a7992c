The recent show of contrition and acknowledgment of failure by Kaduna State governor, Mallam Nasir Ahmad el-Rufai, came as a further endorsement of the position taken by the Northern Elders Forum (NEF’s) verdict on the current administration in the area of security and socio-economic situation in the country.
 
“If not for the security agencies prompt intervention, they would have wiped out the entire villages. I also came to apologise for failing to protect you fully, we are doing our best to minimise such incidents, you should continue to forgive us.”
 
That was how the Kaduna State governor conveyed his feelings, last Monday when he paid a condolence visit on five villages, including Karewa in Igabi and Giwa Local Government Council, where more than 50 persons were slaughtered by bandits very early in the morning, a day before. The governor acquiesced that “as those that have been placed in a position of leadership, the responsibility for protecting these people rests squarely on my shoulders and those of my colleagues. I also came to apologise for my failure to fully protect them.”
 
While reiterating his resolve not to dialogue or negotiate with the bandits, he noted that his administration has zero-tolerance for banditry and as such would, instead of granting them amnesty, grant them passage to their maker.  Commander-In-Chief Of Buck-passing
BUT it must have been most depressing to NEF that President Buhari’s attitude towards well-meaning counsel or criticism is disdainful neglect that finds expression in buck-passing and the blame game.
 
That could have explained why the northern elders made it plain that the “President, who is from the northern part of the country did not only fail the north but the entire nation, based on an assessment of his leadership methodology.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
