The club, it added, had taken a “series of measures to mitigate its effects and reduce the economic consequences of this crisis.” “Essentially, it is a reduction in the working day, forced by the circumstances, and consequently a proportional reduction in the remuneration provided for in the respective contracts.” The Catalan club did not specify, however, the scale of the cuts or if all of its employees are affected.
