Woman arraigned for allegedly beating police officer
A Mapo Customary Court, Ibadan yesterday dissolved the marriage of one Taiwo Oyedeji, an Ibadan-based vehicle dealer and his wife, Aminat, a trader, over claim of infidelity by both parties. The marriage, which lasted for 17 years, was survived by three children.
  
The court ordered the husband, Taiwo, to take custody of the first child and pay N10,000 for the other two children monthly for feeding allowance in addition to being responsible for their education and other welfare.
 
President of the court, Ademola Odunade, told the court that Oyedeji, a resident of Fatusi area in Ibadan, filed for a divorce because he was tired of living under the same roof with his wife who he claimed had made herself a public property.
  
Oyedeji said: “When I suspected that Aminat was engaged in extra-marital affairs, I made her understand that I knew, but rather than stop, she had more confidence. She continued to return home late at night and one day I caught her red-handed. That night, Aminat put her mobile phone on silence and went away but a certain number called her phone over and over. I realized that it was the same phone number I had always warned her about. Then, I told our son who was there with me to bring the phone.
