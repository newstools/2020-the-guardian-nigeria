The Vice-Chancellor of the Federal University Oye Ekiti (FUOYE), Professor Kayode Soremekun has said that the University was establishing a Law Faculty to make it accessible to Nigerians seeking to pursue quality career in legal education.
   
In particzular, Soremekun said FUOYE was establishing the law faculty to deepen access to the legal profession and remove the fear of exclusiveness that people may erroneously have to pursue and make a career in the profession in Nigeria.
   
Soremekun gave this assurance when he received the leadership of the Council on Legal Education (CLE), who visited him in Oye Ekiti while on inspection and verification of facilities for the commencement of programmes in institution!s law faculty.
   
The Vice Chancellor said: “Some prominent legal icon have asked me why we want to start law again in Ekiti knowing that Ekiti State University and Afe Babalola University are already established centres of training in the state.  “My main concern is that you bring in students and there is an air of uncertainty. NUC has approved it for us but CLE has not, that is why we have been waiting, praying earnestly for this day.”
   
The team led by the Director General of the Council, Prof. Isa Hayatu Ciroma (SAN), also included Mr Ibrahim Sanni Mohammed (SAN) who is also the President of Council of Attorney-Generals in Nigeria, Mr Aminu Gadanya, representing the Nigerian Bar Association, Mrs Elizabeth Max-Uba, a director in the Council, among others.
   
The CLE has paid a verification visitation to the Federal University Oye Ekiti where it inspected facilities earmarked for the take-off of the university’s new faculty of law.
   
The Director-General re-called previous efforts by FUOYE and pressure from the Nigerian Law School to bring him and his team to the university to see facilities and other preparations for the takeoff of the Law School.
