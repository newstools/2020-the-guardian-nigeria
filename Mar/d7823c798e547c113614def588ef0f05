After the COVID-19 pandemic began in China late last year, Europe in recent weeks emerged as the biggest flashpoint and the death toll on the continent surged over the weekend. Spain and France registered 183 and 29 new deaths respectively yesterday, their worst one-day tolls. Pau Barrena / AFP Spain has registered nearly 1,000 new COVID-19 infections over the past 24 hours, raising the total number of cases to 8,744, the health ministry said on Monday. Over the same period, the number of deaths rose by nine to 297, the ministryâ€™s emergencies coordinator Fernando Simon said.
