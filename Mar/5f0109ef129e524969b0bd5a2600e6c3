Tereshkova’s suggestion to let Putin run again due to his “massive authority” came as a surprise but was swiftly approved. The Russian president is currently serving his fourth and final term which would end in 2024. He announced sweeping reforms in January during a state of the nation address, saying the constitution needs to be updated. Critics immediately saw the drive for constitutional amendments as a move by Putin to stay in power beyond 2024, though the leader has repeatedly denied he is seeking to remain president. On Tuesday, Putin said he would be against completely lifting the two-term limit for any Russian citizen to remain in the Kremlin.
