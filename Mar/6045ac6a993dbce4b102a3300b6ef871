Kelly as he has been hit with additional charges for sleeping with minors. In a revised indictment filed on Friday, March 13 in a Brooklyn federal court R. Kelly is accused of transporting a minor across state lines. In addition to coercing another minor into sexual activity and transmitting herpes to her. According statements obtained by TMZ, R. Kelly’s lawyer, Douglas Anton in his response to the new charges, questioned the authenticity of the new allegations. “It is unclear why the government, in speaking to Jane Doe #3, for example, would not have garnered from her these additional factual allegations in the over one year they have been speaking with her already.” Anton maintain that the victims are not “victims” but women who have been “instructed”: “These are serious criminal allegations. How does an alleged victim ‘forget’ such things? Or… perhaps… these allege victims are not victims at all, but only women who have been told and instructed, even peer pressured if you will, years later, that the claimed relationship they freely and voluntarily engaged in, should now, in the #metoo era, be classified as ‘bad’ or ‘abusive,’ and they are continually seeking to add facts, even if not truthful, to their story, to make the alleged events as salacious as humanly possible.” The updated indictment in Brooklyn was filed one week after federal prosecutors filed new charges against Kelly in Chicago. The 53-year-old has pleaded not guilty to all charges in New York and other jurisdictions. R. Kelly, whose full name is Robert Sylvester Kelly remains jailed without bond at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Chicago.
