It has taken months of building and planning, but it is finally here. A few weeks ago, the vendor website was launched, making it accessible to top vendors across a range of industries to set up shop and upload their products. Now, the client app is live and customers can shop freely on Kiitec.com. What is Kiitec.com? Kiitec.com is a platform that gives users the power to customize their purchases. A wide range of products and services are available on the platform and there is definitely something for everyone.

That’s the Kiitec.com order process. The first step is to sign up for a Kiitec.com account. Be rest assured that all your information is safe and will not be shared with a third party. Next, you can browse the homepage and sort through a variety of product categories and subcategories. Right now, we have various subcategories under fashion, and you can also shop for exquisite cakes. Alternatively, you can use the search button if you’ve got something specific in mind. When you’ve arrived at the product you want to order, simply customize to your heart’s content, and place your order. Your card details are completely safe, and you have nothing to fear. You will receive an order confirmation email, and you’re good to go. Given the process involved in the creation of products, express deliveries are unavailable. The vendors have to create these items from scratch based on customer wants and customizations. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-1120918 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Kiitec.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="992" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Kiitec.jpg 1818w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Kiitec-772x598.jpg 772w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Kiitec-1486x1152.jpg 1486w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Kiitec-487x377.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Kiitec-974x755.jpg 974w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Kiitec-310x240.jpg 310w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Kiitec-619x480.jpg 619w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Kiitec-600x465.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> To ensure quality and perfection, the vendor needs some time to create and deliver. The platform is live and active so head over to Kiitec.com, create your account, and start shopping! If you’re a vendor looking to set up a shop on Kiitec.com, you can find more information on the site. Connect with us on Twitter and Instagram to keep up with news and updates.
