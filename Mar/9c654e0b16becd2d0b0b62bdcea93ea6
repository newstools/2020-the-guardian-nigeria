The Edo State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), yesterday, cautioned the 14 ‘absentee’ lawmakers-elect in the state to stay away from state House of Assembly (EDHA), saying the 14 seats belong to PDP candidates. The party said its members who have rightly approached the courts over the refusal of the 14 lawmakers-elect to subscribe to the Oath of Membership/Allegiance, with respect to the affected constituencies, coupled with the declaration of their seats vacant by the Speaker of the Assembly, disqualifies them from being addressed as lawmakers-elect. A statement by the PDP state Publicity Secretary, Mr. Chris Nehikhare, said the 14 absentee lawmakers-elect can no longer be referred to or described as lawmakers-elect or lawmakers, their seats having been declared vacant by the leadership of the of Assembly. “The Edo State House of Assembly is not a property of APC, neither are the constituency seats bargaining tools in their political bazaar. The 14 absentee lawmakers-elect are hereby advised to stay away from EDHA, as those 14 seats belong to PDP candidates who have rightly approached the courts and argued that the refusal/neglect by the absentee lawmakers-elect to subscribe to the Oath of Membership/Allegiance with respect to the affected constituencies throughout the First Session and First Quarters of the 7th Assembly of Edo State amounts to abdication of office. “I can’t reconcile why you think you can still lay claims to being a lawmaker even after the speaker declared your seats vacant,” Nehikhare said.
