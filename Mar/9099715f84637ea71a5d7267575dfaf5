When I visited President Muhammadu Buhari, the COS was not available, as he was said to be on an official assignment in Kogi State. “For that of Bauchi Governor, we had a National Executive Council (NEC) meeting where almost all governors were in attendance. I was seated just after Bauchi Governor, we shook hands and also exchanged pleasantries, but as at then, he had not come in contact with Atiku’s son and so, I have no link with anyone diagnosed with the virus.” Besides, Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has banned visitors to Government House, except those on invitation, saying the state government would take over any cinema or nightclub that opens for operations. Wike stated this shortly after inaugurating the task force on enforcement of the ban on public and religious gatherings at Government House, Port Harcourt yesterday.He said, “Any cinema or nightclub that opens will be acquired by the state government.
