 Guinean President Alpha Conde addresses the media after he cast his vote for the referendum and legislative vote at the polling station in Conakry on March 22, 2020 during a constitutional referendum vote. – Guinean President Alpha Condé assured on March 21, 2020, that the constitutional referendum and legislative elections scheduled for March 22, 2020, in Guinea will be held “in a calm and transparent manner”, despite the deadly protests of the opposition for whom these consultations pave the way for a third term of office for the Guinean leader.

The impoverished West African state has officially recorded 20 cases of coronavirus, none of them fatal. The latest steps add to measures announced on March 26, including the declaration of a state of emergency, the closure of borders except for goods trade, the shuttering of schools and places of worship, and a ban on gatherings of more than 20 people. The curfew has been announced at a time of deep political crisis in Guinea over Conde’s plans to change the constitution — a move that the opposition says is a plot to extend his time in office. Several dozen people have died in violent protests since October. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
