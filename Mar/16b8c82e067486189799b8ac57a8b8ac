Former Africa’s table tennis top seed, Segun Toriola, will miss the Tokyo 2020 Olympics in Japan after he and his pairing partner, Olufunke Oshonaike lost to Egypt’s Omar Assar and Dina Meshref in the mixed doubles event finals of the Africa Olympic Qualifying Tournament held yesterday in Tunis. Toriola, who had hoped to create an eighth Olympics Games appearance record at the Olympics Games, fell short of the expectation in a thrilling encounter decided yesterday. However, Oshonaike had qualified for her seventh Olympics appearance, a record by any female athlete in Africa after booking her place in the Tokyo 2020 on Friday. A disappointed Toriola stated that he was grateful to God to have been given the chance to the Olympics a record seventh time.“I had wanted to try and make it eight times to the Olympic games, but unfortunately, I could not. In all, I am very happy with my career to become the first African to attend seven Olympic games. I hope upcoming players will take it from here. Olympic Games for me has been a great experience,” Toriola said.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
