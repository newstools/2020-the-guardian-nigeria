Although many businesses surveyed under the Central Bank of Nigeria’s Business Expectations Survey (BES) for the month of March expressed optimism about the macroeconomy, they are equally worried about the inflationary trend and lingering constraints in the business environment. Indeed, respondents’ outlook on the volume of total order, business activity and financial conditions (working capital) were positive during the review period.
