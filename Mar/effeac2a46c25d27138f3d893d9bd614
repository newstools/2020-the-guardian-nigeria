Gov. Seyi Makinde of Oyo State has urged Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) members in the South-West geopolitical zone to unite, reposition the party and help it to regain its lost glory. Makinde made the call while speaking at the PDP South-West stakeholders’ meeting held at the government house on Thursday in Agodi, Ibadan. He said that a united South-West PDP would rub off positively on the party’s national outlook. According to him, the unity and wellness of the party in the South-West have always been tied to its progress at the national level. ”What we are dealing with is a game of numbers, and we have to accommodate one another. ”Let us not assume some people are bad, because they have their own roles to play. So, I am for unity in the South-West and I have donated myself to pursue it for the region. ”In Oyo State, we have experienced disunity before and we know the implications. After the 2015 general election, we returned together and said we must not tread on that path again. “The only path to victory and success is to be united. Unless we begin to embrace ourselves at the moment of disagreement, we cannot be statesmen,” Makinde said. Chief Olabode George, Eddy Olafeso, former Ekiti State governor, Mr Ayo Fayose, among other leaders, also called on all members to work for progress of the party.
