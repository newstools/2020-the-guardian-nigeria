Internet Advisor, a website that helps consumers compare available internet service providers in their area, is the organisation offering $1,000 to one lucky binge-watcher who must watch the first two seasons of the show “Ozark” on Netflix as reported by the Insider.

The organisation is offering this promotion to celebrate the arrival of the show’s third season, which is set to be released on March 27. The chosen viewer will need to watch the entire first and second seasons of the show which is about 20 hours of viewing from wherever they wish, in the span of 17 days. To know if you are truly watching it, they will need you to answer a questionnaire as you go, counting the number of times various tropes recur and recording their reactions to major plot points. In addition to the $1,000 cash prize, the winner will receive a Netflix gift card and a bundle of “Ozark” swag, which includes things like a mug and stapler. Interested people were required to submit a brief application talking about if/why they’re the biggest “Ozark” fan The site has the option to attach a video submission as well. The competition is only open to US residents who are 18 years or older, and the deadline to apply is March 27, sorry if you are not in the US. This will not be the first time people are paid to binge-watch TV series, The office and Star Wars also did it for some of their fans. “Ozark” is an award-winning crime drama starring Jason Bateman as Marty Byrde, a financial planner embroiled in a money-laundering scheme.
