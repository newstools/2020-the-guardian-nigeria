Transactions on the equities sector of the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), reversed past positive sentiments to close on a downturn yesterday, causing the All-Share Index (ASI) to slump by 0.05 per cent Specifically, the ASI depreciated by 11.68 points or 0.05 per cent to 21,729.48 points, while investors lost N6 billion in value as market capitalisation declined to N11.324 trillion. The downturn was impacted by losses recorded in medium and large capitalised stocks, amongst which are, Total Nigeria, MTN Nigeria, Africa Prudential, FCMB Group and GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Nigeria. The Chief Operating Officer of InvestData Consulting Limited, Ambrose Omordion pointed out that the medium and high cap stocks have hit new lows on the Exchange. “They are selling at a huge discount, considering their intrinsic values as the Coronavirus continues to take a toll on the global and domestic economy, even as the Central Bank and government continue to unfold a bouquet of stimulus package to mitigate the impact on the Nigerian economy. “We expect mixed performance to continue, as market players interpret the outcome of Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) and expected impact of the stimulus package on the economy in the midst of investors expecting their dividend payment from the companies that postponed their Annual General Meeting (AGM)”, he added. FSDH Group Research said: “The markets may remain volatile in the near term. We advise investors to accumulate quality stocks at lower levels with a long-term investment horizon.” However market breadth closed positive, with 20 gainers versus seven losers.
