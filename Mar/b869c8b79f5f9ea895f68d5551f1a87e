The Vice Chancellor of the Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta (FUNAAB), Professor Felix Kolawole Salako, has reiterated the commitment of the university to quality education to ensure food security. Also, the university administrator described the accusation by an expelled student of the university, Ifemosu Adewale, that the vice chancellor sent killers to invade his apartment as a character assassination against him and the university. Adewale, who was expelled by the university over allegations against the university on transportation systems, insecurity of students and activities of law enforcement agencies running after suspected drug abusers and fraudsters, had accused Prof. Salako in a publication in the Sahara Reporters of sending assassins to attack him recently. “Mr Ifemosu is a former student of FUNAAB. He was expelled recently by the university having been found guilty of gross misconducts. I wish to state unequivocally that I, as a vice chancellor, a father and a God-fearing human being, have no reason whatsoever to send assassins to Mr Ifemosu Adewale, who I do not know personally till now…,’’ Prof. Salako said. The vice chancellor said from all indications, Ifemosu was being mischievous and could be planning to attack him, saying the matter had been reported to the security agencies. The university said despite that Ifemosu had instituted a case against the university over the expulsion, he still went ahead maligning the administrator and FUNAAB. On the allegations around transportation, the university said bus fare remained N10 from 2010 to May 2019 and the upward review was pegged at N20 from Camp Junction to the campus even in the face of inflation and economic realities pointing negative. Ifemosu had claimed that the transportation system of the university was not satisfactory because “Money went down the drain,” but the university said he could not substantiate the allegation of mismanagement. “Let us juxtapose the fare with inflationary trends in our country, and ask how 21 available buses are being maintained. In 2019, our loss was 20% in spite of fare increase. Let it be known that there is hardly any university in the southwest which is providing official transport system for students,” the vice chancellor explained. Comrade Tomiwa Bamgbose, Ogun State chairman of the National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS), dissociated NANS from Ifemosu’s activities, saying he was seeking cheap publicity and popularity, calling on students to distance themselves from him and maintain peace.
