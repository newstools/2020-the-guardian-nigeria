In response to the growing cases of violent extremism in the country, the Presidency has disclosed that it would henceforth activate community-based platforms to curtail the menace. National Security Adviser (NSA) Maj. Gen. Babagana Monguno, who spoke at a stakeholder validation meeting on the “Study on Preventing and Responding to Violent Extremism” organised by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA) yesterday in Abuja said measures to be taken would prevent and respond adequately to violent extremism. Monguno, represented by Head of Preventing and Countering Violent Extremism, Hajiya Aisha Garba, said the Presidency would leave no stone unturned to ensure the implementation of the Policy Framework and National Action Plan for Preventing and Countering Violent Extremism in the country, while commending the UNDP for supporting the programme. In his remarks, Team Leader, Governance and Peace Building Unit of the UNDP, Matthew Alao, said the UNDP would be supporting the ONSA in three key areas, strengthening their capacity to implement the policy framework, focus on the security agencies as security providers and form a bond/trust between security agencies and the civil societies and the communities. He said the UNDP has been involved in the economic aspect of the matter and would continue to partner the ONSA in this regard.
