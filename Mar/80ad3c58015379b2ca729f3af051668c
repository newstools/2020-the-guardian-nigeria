The leading teams in the 2019/2020 Nigerian Professional Football League (NPFL), Plateau United, Lobi Stars, and Rivers United are on duty today as the race for Enyimba’s title continues across the country. At the bottom end of the table is the battle for survival involving Nasarawa United, Kwara United, Abia Warriors, MFM FC, and Enugu Rangers. League leaders, Plateau United are in Bauchi for a date with Wikki Tourists, a side whose fortunes have changed since former Enyimba coach, Usman Abd’Allah became their manager. The three points will boost Plateau United’s quest for a second crown in four years, just as victory would push the home team further away from the relegation zone. It is a tricky tie in Port Harcourt, where Rivers United host FC IfeanyiUbah, who have blown hot and cold in the 23-week-old season. Rivers United last week won 2-0 away to Heartland FC and would go for another three points that could take them to the top of the log if Plateau and Lobi falter. Against an away game shy FC IfeanyiUbah, who has won only one point on the road, the job looks easy for Stanley Eguma boys. Lobi Stars, who are gunning for another sip from the trophy, will host Kano Pillars in Makurdi. The 2017 champions beat Kwara United away last weekend and need the win to maintain their pursuit of the title. In other games, Sunshine Stars and Abia Warriors, while Dakkarda FC will face Heartland FC. MFM FC and Enugu Rangers will be looking to distance themselves from the relegation zone when they clash at the Agege Soccer Temple in Lagos, while Adamawa United are at home to Warri Wolves. The game between Akwa United and Enyimba has been postponed due to Enyimba’s continental engagement. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
