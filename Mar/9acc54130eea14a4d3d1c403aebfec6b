 Victor Mbaoma (right) missed a late chance to score the winner for Enyimba against Horoya of Guinea… yesterday.  Yesterday at the Aba Stadium, Enyimba were forced to a 1-1 draw by the Guineans, who celebrated the draw as if they had won the tie. They have every reason to rejoice as they need only a goalless draw in Conakry to eliminate the 2003 and 2004 Champions League winners. Augustine Oladapo gave Enyimba the lead in the 18th minute, but that strike was cancelled out by substitute, Boniface Haba in the second half. Lamine N’Diaye’s men were poor in the first half and deservedly went behind to Augustine Oladapo’s 18th-minute effort. Prior to Enyimba’s goal, Horoya had two golden opportunities to equalize, but Alseny Camara and Aristide Bance missed the chances. Haba, who replaced Bance, repaid his coach’s confidence 20 minutes to time when he headed in a cross from Boubacar Samassekou. Victor Mbaoma had the opportunity to give Enyimba the lead, but he missed the chance. Fatai Osho’s men will meet the Guineans again on March 8 inside Conakry’s Stade du 28 Septembre. Elsewhere, Egyptian side, Pyramids FC moved a step closer to the Confederation Cup semifinals after claiming a precious 3-0 away win over Zanaco of Zambia in the first leg of the competition’s quarters.
