The Movement for Actualisation of Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB) yesterday issued a 48-hour ultimatum asking herdsmen to quit the Ogboli-Ohaja community in Awgu Local Council of Enugu State, saying they would not be held responsible for whatever could result from their failure to heed the warning. The ultimatum followed an alleged attack on Monday on a young man, Kenneth Ude, in his farm by some herders. Ude, 32, was said to be working on his cassava farm near his residence when some herders stormed the place and allegedly started pulling the cassava and feeding their cows. An attempt to stop the herders from destroying his farmland was said to have resulted in various machete cuts. His attackers were said to have taken to their heels thinking he was dead. He was rescued and rushed to the Jideofor Medical Hospital in Awgu where he is recuperating. The development was said to have fuelled tension in the area as some young men had combed the bushes in search of the fleeing herdsmen. Also, some police officers from Awgu Division were said to have visited the hospital and taken pictures of the wounded young man. Deputy National Leader of MASSOB, Chief Ikechukwu Ekwe, who spoke with newsmen, said that they would no longer tolerate killing of innocent people by herdsmen in their farms in the area. He said his group had mobilised to “fish out any herder who might not heed the 48 hours ultimatum.” “Enough is enough. We will no longer fold our hands and watch these people decimate us. We will fish them out wherever they may be in this community after 48 hours and handle them in own way,” he said. Meanwhile, Enugu State Police Public Relations Officer, ASP David Ndukwe, when contacted, said he was yet to be briefed on the development and promised to inquire what led to it.
