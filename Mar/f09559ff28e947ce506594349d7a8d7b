Chevron Nigeria Limited (CNL), operator of the joint venture between the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and CNL, has confirmed that none of its employees has contracted the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19). In a statement yesterday by the General Manager, Policy, Government and Public Affairs, Esimaje Brikinn, the international oil company (IOC) said: “Chevron continues to monitor the Coronavirus outbreak around the world and has been utilising the guidance of international and local health authorities. We are regularly updating our workforce and will continue to adjust plans as appropriate as we receive more information. Our top priority is to ensure the health and safety of our workforce and their family members, and we are taking precautionary measures to reduce the risk of exposure.” CNL disclosed that one of its employees, an expatriate in the Escravos operation, who was recently monitored over flu-like symptoms, tested negative to COVID-19. “Chevron is actively responding to the COVID-19 outbreak. Some of the preventive measures in CNL include: daily temperature screening at the entry points to our offices and field locations, issuance of travel advisory to guide all rotational/business and personal travels, pre-embarkation screening, more utilisation of non-face-to-face meeting tools and minimising inviting external parties to CNL’s office,” Brikinn explained. He also explained that advisory on simple personal hygiene measures, like regular washing of hands, covering cough and sneezes, were shared with the CNL workforce as safeguards for protecting themselves and their families.
