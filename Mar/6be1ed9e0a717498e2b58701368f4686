The Ogun State Commissioner for Youths and Sports, Dr. Oludare Sunday Kehinde, may have been suspended by Governor Dapo Abiodun over comments on Chief Olusegun Osoba. A delegation of the League of Registered Political Parties had last week paid a courtesy call on the commissioner in his Abeokuta office during which he was reported to have made the remarks on Osoba, accusing him, among other things, of not “building” his loyalists to get to higher heights. A member of the delegation recorded proceedings at the meeting and later gave the audio to an online publisher who reported into details all the remarks the commissioner made about Osoba. A government source told journalists in Abeokuta that Governor Abiodun had suspended the commissioner over his remarks, which he described as “very unfortunate.” Meanwhile, efforts to speak with the Chief Press Secretary (CPS) to the Governor, Kunle Somorin, failed as he refused to pick several telephone calls made to him, and neither did he reply a text message sent to him.
