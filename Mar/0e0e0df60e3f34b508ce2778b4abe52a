The Rector of Kaduna Polytechnic, Prof. Idris Bugaje has condemned those calling for the scrapping of Almajiri system of education in the northern part of the country. While calling for an improved system, he emphasised that Almajiri education cannot be scrapped due to its complexity. “ It is impossible for the Almajiri system of education to be scrapped. What we can do is to upgrade it,” he said. Bugaje made the remark, yesterday, during the closing ceremony of a capacity building workshop for technical and vocational teachers in Kaduna. Although, he condemned street begging, especially amongst the youths, he said skills acquisition must be included in the curriculum of the Almajiri system of education.
