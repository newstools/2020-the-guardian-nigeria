Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison during a press conference on Sunday announced that there would be new measures on social distancing across the country from noon on Monday that would see the closure of a number of businesses. Some of the businesses affected include includes cinemas, nightclubs, pubs, casinos, indoor sports facilities and places of worship. Meanwhile, restaurants and cafes will be restricted to takeaways only. Morrison said that the tougher measures were being brought in because the earlier calls for social distancing were not being adhered to properly, Variety reports. “Unfortunately, because guidelines can’t be followed, then for public health reasons we now need to take further action which shuts those gatherings down,” Morrison explained. Morrison said he acknowledged that the measures would impact many Australians working in the industries that would close. “Already, as a result of the measures we have been forced into taking this evening, there are many livelihoods that will be impacted as a result,” he said. According to the Australian Government’s department of health, as at 6.30am on 22 March 2020, there have been 1,098 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Australia. Of the 1,098 confirmed cases, 7 have died. And more than 127,000 tests have been conducted across the country.
