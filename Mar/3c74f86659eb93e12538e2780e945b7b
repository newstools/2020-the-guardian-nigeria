Supreme Court on Tuesday dismissed Emeka Ihedioha application to review his removal as Imo State governor. Ihedioha, the candidate of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), submitted his request at the Supreme Court headquarters in Abuja on Wednesday, February 5 2020. The Supreme Court on Tuesday, January 14 nullified Ihedioha’s election as governor and declared Hope Uzodinma of the All Progressive Congress (APC) as the winner of the March 9 governorship election in the state. In the final result for the governorship poll, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) said Uzodinma was fourth in the election, behind Uche Nwosu of the Action Alliance (AA) and Ifeanyi Ararume of the All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA). The seven-member panel of the Supreme Court led by Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN) Tanko Muhammad said the evidence tendered by Uzodinma and APC to him was lawful. The court said votes due to Uzodinma and APC from 388 polling units were not credited in the final result. It declared Uzodinma winner of the election after the uncredited votes were added to the election result. The PDP in different parts of the country protested against the apex court’s judgement. The PDP said the judgement was not a true reflection of justice. The protest in Abuja led by its national chairman Uche Secondus had the party’s 2019 vice-presidential candidate Anambra State Peter Obi, former lawmaker Dino Melaye and other members from different states of Nigeria in attendance at the Supreme Court headquarters. Another set of protesters marched on the streets of Owerri, Imo State capital, asking the Supreme Court to review its verdict on the sacked governor.
