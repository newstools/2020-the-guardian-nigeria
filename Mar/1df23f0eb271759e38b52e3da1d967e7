The Guild of Medical Directors has raised the alarm that several Europeans are flocking into the country to embark on a journey to the United State of America (USA) through Delta Airlines. It urged the Federal Government to introduce more robust protocols for detection of cases, which should include random tests in households whose members embarked on foreign trips. In a statement, yesterday in Abuja, President of the Guild, Professor Femi Dokun-Babalola, said it was possible and even likely, that more cases of the virus might have entered the country undetected. He said, “These measures will go a long way in further protecting Nigerians from Covid-19 as similar measures have been taken in Ghana, Sudan and South Africa, among other African nations.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
