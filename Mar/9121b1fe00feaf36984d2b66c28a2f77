With the assurances of government and the developer to carry all the stakeholders along, Phones and Allied Dealers Products Association (PAPDA), said they are ready to support the Lagos State Government (LASG) in the relocation process of Computer Village from Ikeja to Katangoa. PAPDA President, Ifeanyi Akubue, who stated this, said the dealers will join hands with other stakeholders in computer village to make it a smooth movement as promised by LASG. Already, the LASG has assured stakeholders of the market of a hitch-free movement to Katangowa, Agbado Oke-Odo Local Council Development Area, where the new computer and ICT hub is being relocated, saying that the movement schedule is going on as planned. The Commissioner for Physical Planning and Urban Development, Dr. Idris Salako, stated this while welcoming the PAPDA, who were on a courtesy visit to the Ministry. Salako urged all stakeholders to continue to support the project which was conceived to enhance the sector, stressing that the new ICT and allied business centre would boast of 24-hours electricity, ICT hub, loading and offloading bay, car parks and banking halls among others. He said that the Lagos State Government would continue to share information and engage stakeholders for their buy-in, noting that the present administration is determined to relocate the  Computer Village to a more conducive business-friendly environment in order to address the challenges created by the market in Ikeja. “The new site has been cleared and delivered to accommodate the upcoming development, whilst the construction of adjoining roads has commenced”, he said. He noted that the new ICT Park is being undertaken through Public Private Partnership in which Messrs. Bridgeways is the Private Partner/Developer and urged stakeholders to continue to engage with the developer on grey areas and any other emerging issues. Jimmy Onyemenam of Messrs Bridgeways stated that stakeholders’ engagement had been an integral part of the project and would continue so that stakeholders are always on the same page.
