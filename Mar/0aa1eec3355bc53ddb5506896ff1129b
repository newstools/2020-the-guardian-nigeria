A Federal Capital Territory High Court on Wednesday restrained Adams Oshiomhole from parading himself as the national Chairman of the All Progressive Congress (APC). “Oshiomhole will remain suspended pending the determination of the suit,” Judge Danlami Senchi said in his ruling. Judge Senchi, gave the order following an application of interlocutory injunction filed by Oluwale Afolabi, asking the court to remove Oshiomhole as the party Chairman. “Oshiomhole’s rights as an APC member is currently abated and he cannot continue to act as chairman of the party,” Afolabi said. Oshiomhole had previously been suspended by the party, December 28th 2019. “Can you imagine a national chairman that is creating problems in his own house? Because of that, we had to suspend him and he remains suspended” Governor Obaseki said. The Judge also ordered that Oshiomhole should not be granted access to APC National Secretariat in Abuja.
