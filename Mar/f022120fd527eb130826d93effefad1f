The ongoing legal battle between some chieftains of All Progressives Congress (APC) and the embattled National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, has no doubt thrown some Nigerians into confusion regarding his current status in the party.
  
Since March 4, when the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory, Jabi, Abuja, ordered an interim suspension of Oshiomhole as the national chairman of APC, there have been two conflicting orders. The political intrigues in the party may have led to an application of interlocutory injunction filed by six plaintiffs led by one Mustapha Salihu.
  
Meanwhile, whereas Oshiomhole was the first respondent in the matter, APC was second respondent in the application that was dated January 16. The application, which was filed through their lawyer, Oluwole Afolabi sought among other reliefs, to oust Oshiomhole from office as the chairman of the party.
