 Chineme Martins  Dikko told The Guardian at the weekend that Martin’s medical report shows that the late footballer had no issues for three seasons while playing for Nasarawa United. He noted that investigations were still ongoing on the death of Martins, adding that the LMC was working round the clock to reposition the medical apparatus at all league venues. “Martins medical reports show he had no heart related problem for the past three sessions. “I am also not aware of his former club reporting that the late footballer had heart issues. “All these other reports I believe are fabrications and rumours. On the news that Martins collapsed two days before the NPFL game, that aspect should be left for the committee that is investigating the player’s death to confirm. “I am not aware of such case. Martins’ death came as a big shock to the LMC and we will work hard to ensure all medical facilities needed for NPFL games are in place before every match. “The NPFL Players wellbeing is LMC’s top propriety,” he said.While sympathizing with the players and officials of Enyimba FC, who were attacked by armed rubbers last week when returning from a league game, Dikko also advised NPFL clubs to put all necessary security checks in place when embarking on long journeys to league games to avoid attacks by men of the underworld.
