Executive Secretary of the Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFund), Prof. Suleiman Bogoro, has said the agency suspended sponsorship of conference attendance for Nigerian lecturers due to “infringement and abuse.” He made clarification following reports that the organisation had entirely cancelled the programme meant for lecturers in public tertiary institutions.
