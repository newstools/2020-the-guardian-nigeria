Despite trending reports that President Muhammadu Buhari has tested negative to Covid-19 following a test allegedly conducted by officials of the National Center for Disease Control (NCDC), the Presidency has continued to keep sealed lips. The test became necessary after his Chief of Staff, Malam Abba Kyari, reportedly tested positive to the coronavirus. Kyari, who was sighted after Jum’aat prayers on Friday, was not seen at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, on Monday. His official vehicle was also not sighted at the officially allocated position at the car park in the Admin wing of the State House. He was believed to have allegedly contracted the disease after his recent trip abroad. The chief of staff is reportedly in self-isolation, monitored by NCDC. His case is also reportedly not fatal yet and his staff have been asked to self-isolate. Our correspondent learnt that there is no immediate plan to conduct any test on any of them until they are showing symptoms of COVID-19. President Buhari’s Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina and Senior Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, have also been evading calls to confirm or refute details of the reports. Calls put to their personal lines have not been responded to since the reports began to trend online, Tuesday.
