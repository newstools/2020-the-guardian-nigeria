Doctors at NSIA-LUTH Cancer Treatment Centre, Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH), Idi-Araba, have recommended a neurosurgery for 15-year old Tomiwa Osisanya, who has a brain tumour that has led to diabetes Insipidus and short-term memory loss, in India, at an estimated cost of N4 million. Osisanya, a native of Ogun State had his first surgery in July 2019 at the University College Hospital (UCH) Ibadan, and he is currently on radiation therapy after being diagnosed of advanced craniopharyngioma and scheduled to receive 55Gy of RT in 1.8Gy daily fractions via VMAT. According to his father, Olusola Osisanya, the young teenager developed progressive visual deficit at age 10 after complaining of recurrent headaches, which progressively worsened his visual impairment and resulted to complete visual loss. A month after the first surgery, Tomiwa was referred to undergo radiotherapy to clear the remains of the tumor in the brain but there was no changes as his condition worsened with a complete memory loss and he was referred to undergo a neurosurgery at Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh, New Delhi, India. This is why he is appealing to the public for funds to carry out the surgery in order to save his sonâ€™s life. His details are First Bank, Osisanya Olusola 3007642361.
