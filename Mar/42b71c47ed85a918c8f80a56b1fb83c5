Taraba State Governor Darius Dickson Ishaku yesterday deemed it necessary to return to the state after 87 days of prolonged absence.Ishaku was last seen performing public function in December last year when he presented the 2020 Appropriation Bill to the state House of Assembly. The governor, who arrived in the state about 4p.m., said his prolonged absence was due to the injuries he sustained as a result of the domestic accident he had when he fell down from the staircase in his house located in Abuja, which led to various degree of injuries. He said he was advised by his doctor to seek medical help from Germany, saying: “Those who saw me that morning before I left the country for Germany would tell you that I was actually limping.” On why he failed to transmit power to his deputy, he said it was not necessary “because I came back to the country without any waste of time.” The governor, who asked the people to cease from handshake pending when the Covid-19 virus is addressed, said the state would leave no stone unturned to prevent the virus from entering the state. While urging the people to continue to give him peace for him to herald the much needed development to the state, said his government would continue to extend olive branch to the opposition political parties. Meanwhile, The Guardian reliably gathered that the major reason for his coming back to the state was a deliberate attempt to abate his 90 days absence as that may lead to his impeachment. The governor, The Guardian learnt, may likely return to Abuja shortly after addressing his supporters at the Danbaba Suntai Airport in Jalingo, the state capital.
