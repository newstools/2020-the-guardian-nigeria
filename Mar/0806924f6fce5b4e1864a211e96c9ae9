President Muhammadu Buhari has been urged to toe the path of honour and dignity by bequeathing a durable democratic system imbued with workable institutional structures that will stand the test of time. Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal made the call against the backdrop of a remark made by one of the President’s men, Alhaji Ismaila Isa Funtua on Friday, in Lagos, at the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the Silverbird Group. Funtua had admitted at the occasion that something was going wrong in the country.Reacting to this, Tambuwal appealed to the President to leave a legacy that he would be remembered for, noting that before Buhari came to power in 2015, he was one of those that had respect and admiration for him. The Governor, who also bagged the Silverbird ‘Man of the Year’ award asked, “But can we say so in 2019?” Pointing out that the President has a departure point in 2023, he urged Nigerians to make sure that the institutions are working, adding that the country doesn’t need strong men. It needs strong institutions. “We as practitioners in politics know what we are doing. We should know that, first, there is God. We are supposed to respect the voting rights of our citizens. We must not continue to manipulate our ways to power and we must desist from attempts to emasculate our judicial system. “What we need to do is to make sure that we reform our electoral system and allow the system to exercise the franchise, conduct free, fair election and whoever wins should be so declared. We should allow the votes to count. “We should allow the security personnel to go and face the real challenges that we have in the country. Not that when we have elections, they will fly people to Kogi, Bayelsa, Osun; leaving behind people in Borno, Adamawa and Yobe, allowing Boko Haram to be traversing the length and breadth of the country.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
