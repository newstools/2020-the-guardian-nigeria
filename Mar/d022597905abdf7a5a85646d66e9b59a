The Nigerian Government on Tuesday said it will be distributing food items to vulnerable households in the country during the coronavirus stay-at-home period. “We will distribute food rations to Households, with particular emphasis to vulnerable households in the front line states including Lagos, FCT, and Ogun,” Nigeria’s humanitarian affairs, disaster management and social development minister Sadiya Umar Farouq said in a statement. “To this end, we would be expanding our safety net programmes to include more vulnerable people whose conditions may be exacerbated as a result of the unintended consequences of the lockdown.” Nigeria President Muhammadu Buhari on Sunday ordered the restriction of movements in Nigeria’s capital city Abuja and Lagos, which are the hardest hit by a coronavirus in the country. These measures, Buhari said, are the best and most efficient way to avoid getting infected is through regular hygienic and sanitary practices as well as social distancing. Buhari noted that business closures in the nation’s capital city, Lagos and Ogun State will cause many citizens inconveniences but urged them to see it as a sacrifice for the good of the country. Farouq, however, said she has briefed the FCT Minister and the governors of Lagos and Ogun state on the social interventions provided with the compliance of the presidential directive. “We will continue with the Cash transfers to households, using data mined from the National Social Register, while we rapidly expand the National Social Register to immediately capture more households to benefit from the cash transfer programme,” Farouq said. The minister said the ministry will help Nigerians reduce the hardship caused by the outbreak of coronavirus which necessitated a stay-at-home order by the government.
