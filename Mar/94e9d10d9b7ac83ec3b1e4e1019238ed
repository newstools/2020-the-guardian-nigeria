• Speaker denies rift among lawmakers The crisis brewing in the Lagos State House Assembly, with the controversial removal of two of its principal officers and members does not bode well for the Assembly and APC Lagos State. This is more so at a time when the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) is enmeshed in various crises both at the national and state levels. At the Lagos Assembly, the Chief Whip, Mr. Rotimi Abiru, who represents Shomolu II and Deputy Majority Leader, Mr. Olumuyiwa Jimoh, representing Apapa II were removed during Plenary on Monday 9, 2020.
  
Although the leadership of the Assembly claimed that 27 members unanimously supported the removal of Abiru and Jimoh according to the provisions of the Rules and Standing Orders of the House, with the approval granted by the Speaker, Mr. Mudashiru Obasa, subsequent events did not support such position as several insinuations were later ascribed for the development.
 
Obasa, while defending the issue, noted that the parliament serves as the heartbeat of every democracy and its sanctity and positive response is key, and therefore the need for discipline.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
