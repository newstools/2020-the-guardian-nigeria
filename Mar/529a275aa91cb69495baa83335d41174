The Supreme Court on Monday adjourned the hearing of the All Progressives Congress’ application seeking the review of the judgment which voided votes of the party in the 2019 general election in Zamfara State on the grounds of an invalid primary election till March 17. The five-man panel of the apex court led by the Chief Justice of Nigeria, Justice Tanko Muhammad, adjourned the hearing after realising that the 141st to the 178th respondents to the application was not represented in court and was not served the hearing notice. The apex court had on February 18, adjourned the matter to March 2 for the same reason. At the resumed hearing on Monday, 141st to 178th Respondents were still not represented by any lawyer and the apex court said there was no evidence that they were duly served with all the processes and the hearing notice. The CJN-led panel said the application of appeal is incompetent if the respondents were not represented and therefore it could not continue with the proceedings. Counsel to the APC and other applicants Chief Robert Clark (SAN) then sought for an adjournment to either serve them hearing notice or remove the said respondents as parties to the action. The court then adjourned the hearing to March 10 but Chief Mike Ozekhome (SAN), who represented the Kabiru Marafa faction of the party, pleaded that he would be travelling abroad on a medical vacation that day. Justice Tanko accepted the plea and subsequently adjourned the hearing to March 17, 2020. The APC is seeking review of the May 24, 2019 judgment which nullified the victory of all the party’s candidates at the 2019 general elections held in Zamfara State. The Supreme Court had on August 22, struck out the APC’s application but it was refiled in November 2019 by the party.
