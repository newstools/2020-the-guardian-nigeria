Anda Damisa, known widely as Lazy Writa, recently released a book, titled, A Lazy Poet.  The writer, who was listed in Y Naija’s top 100 social media influencers of 2013, is the face of some of the country’s leading brands.
   
Speaking with The Guardian at the launch of the 70-page poetry book in Lagos, Damisa, who described his social media activism as a coincidence, said, “it was something I stumbled upon. First and foremost, I’ve been an avid reader and have always loved writing, so, I like to define myself as a writer first before any other thing.
 
A Lazy Poet is a collection of 22 poems that talk about everything. “It is a book everybody can relate to. There’s something in there for everybody — sweet, bitter, touchy experiences and something to remember. It’s a collection of poetry about love, pain, heartbreak, life and much more. There’s something on love, romance (The Golden Quartet), pain (Pain Song, Grief), and this book is basically on daily lifestyle,” he said. “I am inspired by personal experiences and from the works of other brilliant authors that I read.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
