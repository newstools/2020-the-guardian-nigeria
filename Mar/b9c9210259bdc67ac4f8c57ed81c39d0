  He praised the Vice President of the United States and head of the country’s Task Force on Coronavirus, Mr. Mike Pence, for leading members in prayer at their meeting on February 26, 2020, and described as “misguided” those who portrayed the move as “unsettling” and “odd.” Speaking through the church’s Publicity Secretary, Brother Benedict Hart, Ifeacho said other leaders should follow the U.S. example, rather than arrogantly believing only in their own efforts. He said while the tension and panic measures by peoples and governments are understandable and reasonable, a fact that should not be discountenanced “is that we should trust in God Almighty and be prayerful, even as we observe the preventive measures as outlined by health officials.” The cleric, who used the occasion to commiserate with the victims of last Sunday’s explosion at Abule-Ado in Amuwo-Odofin Development Area of Lagos State, said only God Almighty has the power to bring the pandemic to an end, either by stopping it directly or teaching human beings the cure for the ailment. While expressing sadness over the explosion at Abule-Ado, the GKS President prayed God to give the victims the fortitude and means to cope with the disaster. He urged the authorities and all well-meaning individuals and institutions to do their utmost to rehabilitate the victims, strictly enforce building and safety regulations and avoid whatever pitfall that resulted in the disaster. He appealed to the government and the people to strictly enforce environmental sanitation laws and to regard as a matter of utmost importance, the protection of citizens’ lives and property.
