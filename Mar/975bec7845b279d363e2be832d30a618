Suspected Boko Haram terrorists in gun trucks have attacked Dapchi, Yobe State, forcing many residents to flee for safety into nearby
bushes. Our correspondent gathered that some of the residents had alerted the military before the insurgents targeted the Dapchi military post along Gashua road. The town was attacked on February 19, 2018, by insurgents who abducted 110 schoolgirls at Government Girls Science and Technical College. Five of them died, Leah Sharibu is however in the captivity for refusing to convert from Christianity to Islam while others were released. Confirming the attack Thursday in Damaturu, an anonymous soldier attached to Dapchi military post, said “the terrorists have
torched many houses here in this town. “Many people also fled for safety into nearby bushes, shrubs and the Kumadugu-Yobe River across the road for cover.” He said some residents also fled to the nearby village of Jumbam, 15 kilometres south of Dapchi, and the council headquarters of Bursari Local Government Area. The soldier in a telephone interview also told The Guardian that the terrorists came in dozens of gun trucks patrolling the town for
several hours. Audu Musa, a resident also said their mobile telephone lines have been disrupted after the terrorists destroyed the telecom masts along Damaturu-Gashua road. He said the disruption was to prevent communities in the Damaturu/Gashua axis from alerting troops and other security agencies. Commuters along the road in the north part of Yobe State had to abandon the 100-kilometre Dapchi/Damaturu road due to the attacks and killings. The commuters, according to him, ply the Gashua/Jakusko/Potiskum road before crisscrossing six council areas to reach Damaturu, the state capital.
