Popular Instagram influencer Yekaterina Didenko is reported to have been celebrating her 29th birthday when the tragedy occurred. It is gathered that Didenko’s husband was among the three people who died in the incident. In an earlier video message, the blogger, looking shaken and distressed, said he had been rushed to intensive care. All the victims are said to be aged about 30. It is unclear why dry ice was poured into the pool but a report has it that it was to reduce the temperature after guests exiting the sauna complained it was too warm while other reports say it may have been poured into the pool to create “visual effects.” Guests of the party reportedly choked and several lost consciousnesses when they came in contact with the dry ice. Immediately the swimmers started to choke and several lost consciousnesses. Preliminary analysis indicates the cause of death was suffocation. Since dry ice is a solid form of carbon dioxide gas, if it’s placed in an area without proper ventilation, it can cause people to inhale dangerous amounts of the gas.
