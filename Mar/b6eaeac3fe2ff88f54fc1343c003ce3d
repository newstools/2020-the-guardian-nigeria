President Muhammadu Buhari has ordered the military to clinically finish the remnants of Boko Haram insurgents in the North East to restore peace in the region. Inaugurating the National Humanitarian Coordination Committee (NHCC) at the State House, Abuja yesterday, the president said the rehabilitation of devastated communities was to begin in earnest. He stressed the need to harmonise all humanitarian activities in the zone for greater effectiveness hence the creation of the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development last year to develop policies and coordinate national and international humanitarian interventions, among others. The president lauded local and international partners for their assistance over the years, assuring them of government’s continued commitment.
The Nigerian leader said in realisation for a smooth working relationship, the government, through the concerned ministry, approved a “civil-security coordination workshop to provide a platform for all stakeholders to deliberate and agree on frameworks and guidelines for civil security coordination in   humanitarian action.” In her remarks, the minister and chairman of the committee, Hajia Sadia Umar Faruq, said: “There is a global humanitarian crisis, as available statistics indicate that there are 70.8 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) all over the world. In the Northeast, it is estimated that 2.2 million people have been displaced, which presents a serious humanitarian challenge.” In a related development, the presidency said it would henceforth activate community-based platforms to curtail insurgency. Coordinator, Counter-Terrorism Centre (CTC) in the office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA), Rear Admiral, Yem Musa, disclosed the decision while speaking yesterday a stakeholders’ validation meeting on the “Study on Preventing and Responding to Violent Extremism” organised by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the ONSA in Abuja. Represented by Head of Preventing and Countering Violent Extremism, Hajiya Aisha Garba, the coordinator said the measures to be taken would prevent violent extremism in the land.
