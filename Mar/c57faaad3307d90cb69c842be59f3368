Opposition political parties in Enugu State, under the auspices of Conference of Nigeria Political Parties (CNPP), yesterday blamed the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for their poor showing during last Saturday’s local council election in the state. The result of the election released by the Enugu State Independent Electoral Commission (ENSIEC) showed that the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) won in the 17 local councils of the state. The opposition political parties, however, stated that the action of INEC on February 14, this year, whereby it deregistered several political parties in the country affected the performance and participation of parties in the election. A statement in Enugu by its state chairman, Adonis Igwe, which congratulated those that emerged in the election, said that the opposition political parties were happy that the process was rancor-free and commended the state governor, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, for providing the platform for peace in the election. He said: “It is only people who have witnessed electoral violence that will tell you exactly what Enugu State people are benefiting under this administration and especially in the last election because when political violence occurs during elections, it adversely affects innocent citizens, most especially women and children, and many will die while valuable property will be destroyed. For this reason and many more others, we commend the Enugu State government for the feat. At the end, no life was lost and only in Enugu can you witness such development.” Meanwhile, the results of the election announced by the Chairman of ENSIEC, Dr. Mike Ajogwu, stated that PDP won in all the councils. He noted that the winners of the councillorship positions had been announced earlier on Saturday at each of the 17 council secretariats.
