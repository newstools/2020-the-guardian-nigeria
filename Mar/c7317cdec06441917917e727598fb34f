Confirmed cases of the virus in Nigeria jumped to 30, with eight new cases confirmed by the National Centre for Disease Control on Sunday. Sanwo-Olu had earlier ordered schools, bars, and cubs to shut down in the state. Public gatherings have also been limited to not more than 50 persons. Many churches and mosques conducted their services on Sunday morning online. Those who have congregations of more than 50 persons were forced to shut down by the police. Non-essential government workers on levels 1 to 12 have also been told to work from home for the next two weeks. And the state governor said private companies should toe the same path, noting that social distancing can help break the cycle of the transmission of the virus. He said the Government was not unaware of the economic impact that had attended the outbreak of COVID-19 in the State, promising that his administration was ready to cushion the effects on the vulnerable residents. The Governor said law enforcement agencies would be embarking actions that would drive strict compliance to measures initiated by the State to protect members of the public. “I want to reiterate that the Government will frown at any organisation, whether public or private, that is not obeying this directive,” Sanwo-Olu said. “The social distancing directive is not a religious matter; it is a matter of morality and civic responsibility. “Times like this call for heightened commitment to doing the right thing. Our law enforcement agents are to ensure that there’s strict compliance to this important public health tips.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
