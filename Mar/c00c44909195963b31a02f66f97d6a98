House Party APP | Photo: Metro UK Naturally, staying home all the time can get really frustrating and boring especially if you loved to go out every now and then. But, with the help of technology, being on lockdown as a result of the coronavirus outbreak is becoming more bearable with the wide variety of video conferencing apps that allow you to talk and see your friends and family. One of such app making serious headway is ‘Houseparty’ which allows you to play games with your friends and video call altogether. Billed as a social video app, it’s available for free for both Android and iOS and has been downloaded millions of times since the coronavirus struck the UK. Despite the newfound popularity, Houseparty was initially launched back in 2016; it takes a worldwide pandemic and housebound population to make your app a success, sometimes. Basically, you will be able to start talking straight away to your friends upon signing up, unless they’ve chosen to lock their ‘room’ of the party. Where the app really stands apart is in the number of games that you can play during calls. Some of the games include Heads Up, Trivia and Quick Draw and you can play with up to eight people at a time. Throw in a few drinks and some snacks and you are set for, as the name suggests, a virtual house party. Ultimately, this has brought so much excitement to many who are adhering to the “stay home” rule amidst the coronavirus pandemic. Read some reactions below:
