However, he added that he, his baby and his crew are negative. According to him, he “decided to take ourselves and our all close associates we’ve come in recent contact with for the COVID-19 test on the 25th of March.” Below are some of the reactions of Nigerians to this news: Davido’s Chioma is tested positive for Covid 19, This is disheartening , what is the assurance I don’t have or you don’t have too because some of us have not done test, please I think this is the right time for all of us to stay at home and isolate ourself for 14 days… — Engineer Tolu Tezzy_  (@tolutezzy_) March 27, 2020  So now we know that 33 asymptomatic people got tested. Davido, Chioma and their close associates. — The CV Writer (@FunkeOnafuye) March 27, 2020  We cover Chioma and Davido with the Blood of Jesus… — DANNY WALTER  (@Danny_Walterr) March 27, 2020  Davido just confirmed that Chioma is positive for Coronavirus, a nursing mother fgs. Can this Disease stop already??? Stay Safe David and the rest of the family. Wishing her Quick Recovery as well. — Duke of Ibadan  (@AsiwajuLerry) March 27, 2020  I feel Davido & his crew were irresponsible, he cancelled all his shows in USA, he knew what was going on. Only to come back to Lagos and be travelling everywhere. Chioma got back too and was everywhere with him. God help the poor people that came in contact with them. — Mike Anthony DeWine (@makingcheddah) March 27, 2020  I have not been tested, even though i may have been exposed to a confirmed case at the AMVCA but Davido and 32 people, who have no symptoms( a criteria for getting tested) got tested? I was simply told to self isolate and watch but Davido and 32 people got tested? https://t.co/yJEoOoq7HB — Sandra Ezekwesili (@SEzekwesili) March 27, 2020  Mehn the rigging is too much! Davido with his influence tested 32 asymtomatic people in this Nigeria while there are people with symptoms that have not been tested. Y’all really need to be very very worried. — Global (@okeyjames) March 27, 2020  But hope the Davido news about him being Negative is so true and his Team because it was very not smart for him from a hot zone and back to Nigeria and moved to like 2states! I hope it’s True. — Laba Laba Master  (@Buchi_Laba) March 27, 2020  Oh shit!! Davido’s fiancé, Chioma has tested positive for Covid-19 ! Apparently she’s not showing any symptoms but David has decided to go into isolation for 14 days. They were all at Mayorkun’s crib for his birthday. The whole DMW crew needs to self isolate rn! No joke!! — Peng Man  (@pengmanmodel) March 27, 2020  Davido cancelled his US tour…came back from the US and had a show or 2 in Nigeria….that was some very selfish reckless move. — Me…Ferdy (@_The_Immortal) March 27, 2020  Chioma positive, Davido Negative, Their baby Negative, the rest of the crew, Negative. Covid19 is the strangest virus in the history of mankind. — Jack Robinson (@FeralJack_) March 27, 2020
