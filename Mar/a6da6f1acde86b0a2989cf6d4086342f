Kano State Government on Monday removed Sanusi as emir of the Kano emirate after six years on the throne. Secretary to the state government Usman Alhaji said the former Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) governor was removed for his “total disrespect to lawful instructions from the office of the governor and other lawful authorities.” Kano State Government announced Aminu Ado Bayero as the new emir of Kano emirate. El-Rufai has since the dethronement given two appointments of Kaduna State Government to Sanusi. On Tuesday, March 11 2020, El-Rufai appointed the former emir into the board of Kaduna State Investment Promotion Authority. In less than twenty-four hours, the Kaduna State governor named Sanusi II as the chancellor of Kaduna State University. “On behalf of the government and people of Kaduna State, Malam Nasir El-Rufai is delighted to appoint His Highness, Muhammadu Sanusi II as the Chancellor of the Kaduna State University,” Elrufai’s spokesman Muyiwa Adekeye said in a statement. “In public life, His Highness has demonstrated a strong commitment to education.” “The Kaduna State Government has no doubt that as Chancellor, His Highness Muhammadu Sanusi, would provide symbolic and substantive leadership in raising the profile of KASU as an emerging centre of learning on the national and global level.” El-Rufai said Sanusi’s appointment came at an exciting moment for the university’s transition to a multicampus structure with presence across the state. The governor said the state government was grateful that HH Muhammadu Sanusi II continues to support and assist the realisation of its governance objectives.
