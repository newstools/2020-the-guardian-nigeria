Lagos residents yesterday berated the Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, over N2 billion worth of donor request to bring relief to victims of Sunday’s gas explosion in the state.
 
Sanwo-Olu disclosed his plan to go cap in hand for the victims when he visited the scene of the explosion. The approach was, however, flayed by many on the social media, as they demand better succour for families who lost lives and properties in the disaster.
   
The governor hinted that the state had already committed N250 million to the relief fund, which will be chaired by the Deputy Governor, Obafemi Hamzat. He said the incident was beyond what the State government could independently manage. He called on well-meaning members of the society to join the state to salvage the situation.  According to him, politicians think we are fools. They know how to tax, chase businesses away yet try avoid responsibilities.  @okeyjames said: “Sanwo-Olu as the constitutional number one citizen of Lagos state, please tell us how much you are personally contributing to encourage us to contribute. The 250 million is still our money. Thank you as you comply sir.”
 
@PeppersoupWorld said: “My transport has increased by five per cent because I now use Uber to places Keke would have taken me for 100 naira. So the money I would have donated has gone for transport. I still pray that all affected find healing and strength in this trying time.”
 
For @Lucasscot_101, he said: “Which people are gonna donate?! The ones u took away their livelihood via Okada ban, or the ones that had to trek long distance just to get to work b4 9am and return by 10pm?” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
