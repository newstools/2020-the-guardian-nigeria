No fewer than 25 people have died of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) complications in Gombe State, The Guardian authoritatively reports. The deaths were recorded since April 20, 2020, when the state recorded its index case. According to findings, of the 17,703 people screened in the state of the virus, 881 tested positive while 747 were treated and discharged. The Commissioner for Health, Ahmad Gana, stated yesterday: “The state Incident Management System has been in the trenches coordinating surveillance and response. “Gombe State Ministry of Health, as always, has taken proactive steps to protect the citizens in accordance with the governor’s mandate.” Speaking at the handing over of Regional Disease Surveillance System Enhancement (REDISSE) starter packs to 11 council executive secretaries for onward delivery to the 114 wards in the state, the deputy governor, Dr. Manasseh Jattau, commended the state’s COVID-19 committee for its efforts in reducing the spread of the killer virus. He, however, enjoined the citizenry to strictly adhere to all protocols as directed by the committee. “In Gombe, the challenges belong to all. Let all take to the rules of COVID-19 (prevention) while awaiting the vaccine. For us as government, we can’t be tired of those efforts, even if people no longer wear masks,” he added.
