Highlights  Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) and refugees have been identified as being among the most vulnerable population groups to COVID-19 infection in Ethiopia. To ensure an equitable and comprehensive COVID-19 response, IDPs and refugees are being intentionally targeted with key COVID-19 prevention messages and WASH support. Since the onset of the pandemic, UNICEF and its partners have reached 573,150 refugees and at least 135,253 IDPs with COVID-19 prevention messages. A total of 45,000 refugees and at least 3,835 IDPs have access to basic sanitation and 56,625 refugees and at least 18,365 IDPs have received WASH Non-Food Items (NFIs). Some 24 treatment, isolation and quarantine sites hosting refugees are now receiving enough safe water for drinking, cooking and personal hygiene. The water, provided through emergency water trucking and roto tanks distributed to prevent COVID-19, has benefitted 16,005 refugees, including 3,257 women, 2,665 men and 10,083 children. As a part of the COVID-19 response, 17,548 caregivers of children aged 0-23 months and 24-59 months received Infant Young Child Feeding (IYCF) counseling. Among them, 7,191 received counseling in health facilities and 10,357 through established community platforms.
