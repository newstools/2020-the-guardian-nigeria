….Features 2Baba, Timi Dakolo, Waje, Seun Kuti, Brookstone, And LCGC 
Singer, actor cum politician, Olubankole Wellington, better known as Banky W, has come through with a new song titled, Talk and Do, a collaborative offering. The Empire Mates Entertainment (E.M.E) boss announced the release of the track on Tuesday, October 27. The song, which features 2Baba, Timi Dakolo, Seun Kuti, Waje, Brookstone and LCGC, inspires the culture of responsibility where people take action to solve the issues in the society rather than just talk. In the nearly five-minute lyric video, the singer addressed global issues like violence, racism, and police brutality amongst others. According to him, the song was originally going to come with his album in 2021, “but with everything going on in Nigeria and around the world, it feels so relevant for right now,” Banky W wrote in a tweet posted on his handle @BankyW. The 39-year old singer further said the song is for those who have played a role in creating solutions to the issues ravaging Nigeria, while it also serves as an inspiration to others. “If you’ve been doing something, anything to be part of the solution, then hopefully this is your soundtrack. If you haven’t, then hopefully this is your inspiration,” he wrote. To give the song the needed vibe, Banky W sought support and collaboration from colleagues in the industry. Hence, he engaged ace producer, Masterkraft, and singers: 2Baba, Timi Dakolo, Waje, Seun Kuti, Brookstone, and LCGC to petition Nigerians to focus on development and goodwill. “This is not a song, it’s a statement about a very lost generation” are the pensive and striking words that flag off the carefully curated track. Heavy and challenging, the words demand introspection just as they demand accountability and transparency from listeners. Each artiste takes a verse to address a different issue and together, they harmonize in sound, soul, and supplication. Even Seun Kuti’s saxophone rendition is thick with enough soul to stir listeners to change. Recall the last time the Lagos Party crooner actively released a music project was in 2017, and it was an Extended Play entitled Songs About You. Prior to this he released a single in 2016, entitled Mi Re Do (Cocoloso), featuring Stonebwoy and Shaydee. The Wedding Party lead actor had in the build up of 2019 general elections and quest to become a member of the Federal House of Representatives, announced the closure of his record label, Empire Mates Entertainment. During that run, he also announced his retirement from music. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
