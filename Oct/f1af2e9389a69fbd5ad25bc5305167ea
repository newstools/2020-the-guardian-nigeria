Groups including Rebuild Africa Foundation, Imo Peoples Action for Democracy (IPAD),  media, religious bodies in Owerri at the weekend called on the government to address mental health issues in the country. They made the call after a roadshow led by the Chief Executive Officer of Rebuild Africa Foundation, Nnamdi Ucheoma,  and state  Coordinator of IPAD, Majorie Ezihe, in the Imo State capital. The event was organised to mark the  2020 World Mental Health Day. Ucheoma said: “It is our utmost desire that the government will respond positively to this clarion call.
“The idea behind this programme stems from the consequences of our inattention to mental health as well as negligence of mentally deranged individuals. Admittedly, the disconnect has not been addressed because our churches and other religious institutions have been overburdened and the government cannot resolve this menace alone.” According to him, the World Economic Forum has predicted that mental health disorders can cost global economy $16 trillion from 2010 to 2030. “In other words, the lost productivity results from depression and anxiety which are the two most common mental health disorders. Significantly, 75% of people with mental, neurological, and sub-disorders receive no treatment at all.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
