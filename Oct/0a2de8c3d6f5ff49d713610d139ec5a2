The Public Relations Officer, Superintendent of Customs Uche Ejesieme, said the command had articulated concerns of agitators and were being attended to. He admitted that the #EndSARS protests had taken a toll on the paramilitary’s operations. According to him, the command would attend to the issues that are within its capacity, and refer the rest to headquarters of the service for prompt action.
