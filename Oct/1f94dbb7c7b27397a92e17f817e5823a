The United Global Resolve For Peace (UGRFP) has said the only way to solving the policing challenges in the country was to allow the Police Service Commission (PSC) to function independently within the ambit of its statutory powers. It said the commission was set-up as a civilian body to review, discipline, and sanction errant officers while operating a reward system for good corps to engender a culture of professionalism and integrity on the job. UGRFP added that the political will to make the commission function at its barest minimum has been lacking, thus, setting it up for systematic ruin. In a statement, Executive Director, Shalom Olaseni, who commended the protesters for conducting themselves peacefully and with resilience on their calls for policing reforms, stressed that violence must never be an option in the exercise of their rights. According to him, the consequences of the said ruin has crystallised into the boldness of errant officers whose unlawful actions go without reproach or sanction by the commission due to hierarchical issues with the Nigeria Police Force (NPF). Olaseni said: “Suffice to reiterate our conviction as a group that only by fully empowering the Police Service Commission to function fully and independently within the ambit of its statutory powers will the challenges of policing in Nigeria take on a positive lift and turn.
