Submissions for the Grooming University Research grants earlier scheduled to close by October 8 have been extended till October ending.
 
According to the organiser, the submission date was extended to give room for more students to participate as many tertiary institutions are still under lock due to the pandemic and ASUU strike.
 
In the scheme, which is the second edition, Grooming Centre, a microfinance institution, is giving research grants to 150 undergraduate and post-graduate students across the country.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
