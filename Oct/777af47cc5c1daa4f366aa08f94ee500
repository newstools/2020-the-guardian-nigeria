Rivers State Sports Commissioner, Boma Iyaye, believes a successful hosting of the second Governor Wike Pre-Season Football Tournament will put the clubs in good stead for their various challenges in the coming season. Urging the organising committee to stick to laid down rules and regulations, the commissioner said the tournament will not only reiterate the state as the hub for sporting activities in the country, but will also showcase the traditional hospitality of Rivers people.
 
Speaking during the inauguration of the committee in Port Harcourt yesterday, Iyaye said, “the tournament is carrying the crest of Governor Nyesom Wike, the first Power of Sports recipient in Africa,” hence the need to have an impressive outing.
