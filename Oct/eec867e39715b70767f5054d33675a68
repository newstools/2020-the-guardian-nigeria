According to the Shade Room, Tekashi, 24, said that his overdose was a result of pairing a cup of coffee with two Hydroxycut pills instead of the recommended daily dosage of one. The combination of the diet supplements and caffeine “increased his heart rate and caused him to sweat excessively while in front of his computer,” the Shaderoom reported. Tekashi, who is currently on probation, also told the Shade Room that he was not using any drugs at the time of his overdose. The rapper reportedly claimed that he was using Hydroxycut pills because of the weight he gained during his time in prison. Read More:
