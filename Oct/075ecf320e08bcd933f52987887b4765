The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) has arrested its officials caught on tape flogging residents who defaulted the curfew imposed on citizens in Osun State by the governor.
 
In a viral video, some NAF officials were seen flogging and meting out other forms of punishment on the defaulters. The state government had imposed a curfew on the state after hoodlums invaded facilities to loot COVID-19 palliatives and other items.
 
NAF made this known in a series of tweets yesterday entitled: ‘Alleged flogging of curfew defaulters in Ilesha, Osun State.’  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
