At least one person has been reported shot and killed in Surulere, Lagos State on Monday by the policemen dispersing #EndSARS protesters. It was unclear if the yet-to-be-identified man was among the young Nigerians protesting against police brutality before he was shot. In a footage shared on Twitter, the young man, already lying in a pool of his own blood, was hurriedly attended to by the medical team on-ground for the protesters but was confirmed dead after several attempts to resuscitate him. His bloodied corpse has since been carried to the nearest hospital. Protests began last week in different parts of Nigeria over continued harassment of young people by the notorious Special Anti-Robbery Squad â€“ SARS. The protestors are demanding the disbandment of the unit. Members of the squad have been accused of crimes such as extrajudicial killings, kidnapping, extortion and intimidation. The Nigerian Government had promised on multiple occasions to reform SARS and make the squad more accountable. But the promises have been nothing but empty chatters.
