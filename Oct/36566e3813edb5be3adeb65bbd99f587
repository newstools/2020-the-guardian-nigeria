Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday wishes United States President Donald Trump and his wife, Melania, quick recovery for testing positive for COVID-19. “I wish US President, Donald Trump and his wife, Melania, quick and full recovery from Covid-19,” Buhari said on Twitter. Trump, 74, first announced on Twitter that he and First Lady Melania Trump, 50, had tested positive for the virus. “We will get through this TOGETHER!” he wrote. The extraordinary setback for Trump had immediate political consequences just 31 days before election day, forcing him to cancel campaign trips and adding new volatility to a contest already steeped in tension.
