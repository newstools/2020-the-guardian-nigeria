He emphasised the need to support and encourage individuals like Chief Felix Anirah, who put their money to develop and promote grassroots football in Nigeria. The former Crew Alexander and Bury FC defender called on other Nigerians to follow the steps of Anirah by organising similar tournaments. “I must commend Chief Felix Anirah for putting in such total prize money of over N4.5million to develop grassroots football in Delta State,” Sodje said. His younger brother, Sam, who played for Leeds United and Charlton Athletic FC in England, also expressed gratitude to the sponsor, Anirah, for his effort at encouraging the growth of youth football, as well as uniting ex-internationals across the state. Sam stated that great players, who went on to play for various Nigerian national teams were discovered at tournaments like the FAFT. “I want to thank Chief Anirah for engaging the youths, especially young footballers by hosting this competition. I am delighted because competitions like this brought most great footballers like myself to limelight. Chief Anirah is so passionate about youth football development, and I want the players to make good use of the opportunity,” the younger Sodje said. Registration is currently ongoing for this edition of the tournament. It will run to October 31, while draws will hold on November 7 in Sapele, Delta State. The final of the tournament holds on December 15 in Sapele, with Governor Ifeanyi Okowa expected to be in attendance.
