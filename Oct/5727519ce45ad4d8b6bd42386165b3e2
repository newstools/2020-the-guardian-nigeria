 Assistant Commmisoner of Police, Abayomi Shogunle, head of the Public Complaint Rapid Response Unit (PCRRU) poses during an interview on the public’s demand for the recall of the Special Anti Robbery Squid (SARS) of the Nigerian Police Force in Abuja, Nigeria December 5, 2017. REUTERS/Afolabi Sotunde  Shogunle was a former head of the Police Public Complaint Unit while Badmus was a former spokesperson for the Lagos State Police Command and later the Zone Two Command. A list purportedly submitted by the Presidential Panel on Police Reforms was posted online yesterday afternoon, including names and service numbers of 37 officers alleged to have been recommended for dismissal, demotion, or warning. Spokesman for the PSC, Ikechukwu Ani, in an interview with The Guardian, explained that “Dolapo was not dismissed, she has two cases in the first case, she was awarded the punishment of reprimand while in the second case, she was given a severe reprimand. And someone like ASP Tochukwu Ogalagu was given the punishment of reprimand.” He said the news of their dismissal was untrue, adding that the commission only formally received the 2018 Report of the Presidential Panel on Friday. According to him the Presidential Panel had among other things investigated allegations of human rights violations and abuse of office against SARS and recommended reform or restructuring of the outfit. He said: “I am not aware of the demotion, the commission did not sit yesterday and couldn’t have taken such decision. I don’t know where the news is coming from. “The Commission only received the report on the presidential panel on the reform of SARS and commission promised to fasten the implementation of the recommendations, that is the much that happened yesterday.” The list, which was shared by foreign policy analyst, Ayo Akanji, identified affected officers as Abdulhameed Awodi, APNo119444, Erhabo Uwagbie, APNo86180; Idolor Godsent, APNo158580, Mustpha Abubakar, APNo119167, Idoko, APNo 85036, Ilya Aliyu, AP94982, Asabe Luke, APNo,130296, Angela Akaro, AP No, 50829.
