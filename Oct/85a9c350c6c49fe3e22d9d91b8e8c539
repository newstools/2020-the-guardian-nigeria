SUFFICIENTLY citing of the various violations of the APC constitution, some party chieftains rebuffed President Buhari’s admonition of the cessation of further judicial recourse and have approached the court over the dissolution of the party’s NWC. A member of the Lagos State chapter, Mr. Lateef Arigbaruwo, who instituted a matter at the Federal High Court, Lagos, contended that the meeting where the working committee was dissolved and a caretaker put in place was illegal.
 
In his suit No. FHC/L/CS/789/2020, which has Chief Victor Giadom, APC NEC and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) as respondents, Arigbaruwo prayed the court to stop the Buni committee from performing the functions of the NWC.
 
According to the motion on notice, the plaintiff “seeks an order of the court setting aside all the decisions taken at the NEC meeting, which he deemed as illegal on the grounds that it was conveyed on June 24 and held on June 25, contrary to Article 25 of APC constitution.”
 
Although attempts were made to breathe down the neck of Arigbaruwo and arm-twist him into jettisoning the matter in court, he refused to budge even when it was being interpreted as coming from the defunct ACN caucus fragment in APC.  Unmerited grace
