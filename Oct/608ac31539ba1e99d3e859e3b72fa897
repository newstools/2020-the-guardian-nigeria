The Great Reset of the World Economy will stamp out organised financial crime. The World Economic Forum teaches how to achieve a clean economic recovery that combats organised crime. Sadly, criminals have adapted to thrive in the economic environment created by the pandemic, exploiting the crisis to weave themselves into the legitimate economy. In the event of prosecution, only 2 per cent of criminal assets are recovered. Obstacles to recovering criminal assets need to be removed so that ill-gotten gains can be repurposed for the good of society. A starting point would be to improve public-private sharing of financial information to fight financial crime across borders. This quick criminal adaptation undermines economic recovery and will weaken public institutions. Given that money laundering is the engine of organised crime, if access to money laundering services was removed, criminals would not be able to make use of their profits. This offers a good lever to stamp out organised crime. The recommendations from the World Economic Forum- supported coalition offer national economies on how to tackle organised financial crime.
   
The European Union (EU) has launched an Action Plan for a comprehensive policy on preventing money laundering and terrorism financing, to address the issue. The plan can support an economic recovery that works for citizens across the globe, rather than lining the pockets of international criminals. The timing of this Action Plan is the recognition that financial crime is pervasive and weaving its way into a larger number of economic sectors. At the start of the pandemic, European Police demonstrated in the ‘Catching the virus: cybercrime, disinformation and the COVID-19 pandemic’ that cybercriminals were using the pandemic to target communities.
