Residents in Paris and its surrounding Ile-de-France region, along with eight other French cities, will not be allowed to be outdoors between 9:00 pm (1900 GMT) and 6:00 am (0400 GMT) from Saturday, for a duration of at least four weeks, except for essential reasons. The measures were announced in response to Covid-19 infection rates reaching record levels. The curfew will therefore not stop the Champions League game at the Parc des Princes from going ahead but will ensure that it does so behind closed doors. Recent sporting events in and around Paris have seen crowds of up to 1,000 permitted to attend.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
