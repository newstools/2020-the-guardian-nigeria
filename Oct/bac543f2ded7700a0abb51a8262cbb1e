The acting secretary noted that COVID-19 was still prevalent and “we cannot take chances.” Kawu, however, said that there had been a significant drop in the number of people coming down with the disease in the FCT. He appealed to residents to continue with the observation of the non-pharmacological preventive measures of washing of hands with soap and water or hand sanitiser. The acting secretary also urged FCT residents to continue to wear face masks, observe physical and social distancing and avoid large gatherings.
