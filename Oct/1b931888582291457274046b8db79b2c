 Site of a collapsed building at Obalende, Lagos yesterday.            PHOTO: NAN  Although the Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA) confirmed four persons dead, sources said seven bodies have so far been recovered as at 7 p.m. According to LASEMA spokesman, Nosa Okunbo, “Upon arrival at the scene, a three-story building under construction was discovered to have self-collapsed. The cause of the collapse is yet to be ascertained, but efforts are ongoing by LASEMA and other responders towards salvaging the situation. “As at 5:40 p.m. a total of eight persons (all males) had been extricated alive by the LASEMA Response Team and other stakeholders and were quickly transferred to the Lagos Island General Hospital. “Four persons (three males and one female) have so far been recovered dead and handed over to SEHMU at the incident scene. Recovery operation is still ongoing.” Reacting, the Nigerian Institute of Building, Lagos chapter, said: “This is sad. Building collapse keeps resonating in our society. The pre-independence building survey where the building of 175 years is still standing in Badagry is a pointer to the decadence in today’s built environment. The stakeholders need to rise up to their responsibility.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
