Disturbed by the barrage of complaints from motorists and residents accusing the Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC) Taskforce/Marshal of extortion, intimidation, and assault, among other abuses, the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) FCT Council has concluded plans to hold a town hall meeting with relevant stakeholders to investigate the claims and resolve the matter. In a statement issued yesterday by council secretary and chairman of the planning committee, Ochiaka Ugwu, and Omeiza Ajayi, the body said the gathering would hold next Monday at its secretariat in Utako by 10:00 a.m. The document read in part: “Based on the constitutional guarantee in Chapter 22 of the 1999 Constitution (as amended), the NUJ FCT views it as expedient to organise a town hall meeting to review the strategies of the AMAC Taskforce/Marshal, and develop interventions to ensure that key stakeholders are engaged and informed on their activities. “It is also aimed at finding answers to burning issues which if not properly addressed and timely too, could adversely impact the fragile security situation in the territory.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
