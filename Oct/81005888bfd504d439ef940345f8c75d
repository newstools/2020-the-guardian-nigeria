A former Commissioner for Home Affairs in Lagos State, Abdulhakeem Abdullateef, has dumped the ruling All Progressives Congress. His resignation from the ruling party comes days after he publicly declared his intention to contest the governorship election in the state in 2023. The former commissioner, popularly known as ‘Honorable Iyepe’, said an Awori indigene should be given the opportunity to govern Lagos for the first time. His campaign is expected to run under the tagline Iyepe 2023. Abdullateef said there was a need for residents in the state to have a good manager of humans and resources as their governor, saying this necessitated his “intention to lead the state”. “I believe I will have the support of the people when the time comes. Right now, it is not about the campaign. This is a movement, when we get to that we shall cross the bridge,” he added. Apart from being a commissioner, AbdulLateef was also a member of the Lagos State House of Assembly, former Amir-ul-Hajj of Lagos State. He was special adviser on political affairs during the Babatunde Fashola administration. He was appointed the special adviser on Islamic Affairs to the Lagos State House of Assembly speaker in February.
