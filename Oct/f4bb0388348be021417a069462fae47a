Amid rumours of cyber attacks on the websites of major government agencies, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) yesterday said that it was not attacked. A group known as ‘Anonymous’ reportedly hacked major websites in the country, including that of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), in solidarity with the ongoing #EndSARS protesters. But NNPC tweeted yesterday: “The attention of NNPC group has been drawn to purported hack of the websites and other internet-based platforms of prominent Federal Government institutions. “While we confirm that no breach whatsoever has been recorded by the corporation, we wish to assure all NNPC group partners and stakeholders of the fidelity of our spamware protection.” The state oil company boasted that its web-based platforms were adequately protected, assuring the public of continued quality services on all its internet channels.
