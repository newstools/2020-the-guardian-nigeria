The PFA said this was part of its commitment to creating unwavering and enhanced customer service. Speaking at the launch, Executive Director, Operations, Afolabi Folayan, said the initiative was driven by the vision to continue to explore ways to improve customers’ experience throughout their pension journey and interactions. He said with Nafi, customers would have the support they require on their palms right from the opening of their RSAs, to enjoy pleasant retirement life. “The ease of use and comfort of customers was taken into consideration in developing this App, and it would ensure that customers have all the relevant information they need, to be assured that their pension is safe and growing,” he added. Speaking, the Chief Technology Officer, Ugonna Onuoha, said the chatbot would enable the response to priority customer queries in real-time. He noted that queries such as how to open an RSA, view RSA PIN and balance, see the unit price for funds subscribed to, check the current status of benefits applications, and see the last amount contributed would be responded to in real-time. Meanwhile, he said the easy accessibility of Nafi would help Sigma to build a stable relationship with customers without them having to seek out physical channels. Sigma Pensions has also provided the ability for customers to complete their RSA registration and the mandated bio-data recapture online via its website. The client would immediately receive confirmation of completion of the process with the newly registered RSA or notice of any missing documentation or incomplete registration, he said.
