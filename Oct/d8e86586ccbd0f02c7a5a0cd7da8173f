The Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) has announced the postponement of the 2020 edition of the Lagos International Trade Fai due to the economic disruptions brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic and the recent Endsars protests across the nation. According to the Chamber, the fair which will feature both physical (In-person) and virtual (Online) platforms, was initially scheduled to hold from Nov. 6 to Nov. 15, 2020 at the Tafawa Balewa Square, Lagos, but will now hold from Friday 4th to Sunday 13th December, 2020. Director General of the LCCI, Muda Yusuf, in a statement yesterday, said: “The resolve to hold the 2020 edition of the fair is in line with the need for quick restoration of normalcy in the economic and commercial activities in Lagos State and our support for the ongoing “Protect Lagos” Campaign, which is geared towards rebuilding the Centre of Excellence. “In addition to the General Interest Fair, the annual international business expo will also feature Special days for corporate organisations to showcase their inventions, innovations, and sustainability initiatives simultaneously with the fair.
