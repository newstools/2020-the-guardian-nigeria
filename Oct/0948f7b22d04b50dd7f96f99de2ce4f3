 Anthony Cardinal Olubunmi Okogie  Every country has its problems.  But Nigeria’s problems cannot be addressed by the kind of leadership we have at this point in time.  You cannot fix a country by using propaganda.  Neither can you facilitate development by criminalizing expression of dissenting opinions.  We all thought we had said farewell to intolerance of opposition on May 29, 1999.  But recent experiences show us that we were wrong.  What went wrong?
           
First, we need to be rescued from selfishness.  The Lord God has been immensely generous to our land.  He has made this land very rich.  Why then do we have poverty in the land?  We have poverty because of selfishness.  We have poverty because the Nigerian has been impoverished by an oligarchy that has cornered the riches of our land.  How else does one explain the fact that a few of us can afford to own property in foreign lands when some of us cannot afford to pay their transportation to the market or office? Secondly, we need to be rescued from falsehood.  Nigeria needs to be redeemed from the falsehood that says it is well with Nigeria when in fact symptoms of Nigeria’s ailment are glaring and too many to count.  Which of these can we not see?  Is it insecurity of life and property?  Is it abject poverty?  Is it suppression of legitimate dissent by government and its agencies?  Is it the apprehension that comes with every election?  Is it ethnic and religious disharmony? Or official denial of these points to the fact that Nigeria is in need of redemption from falsehood.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
