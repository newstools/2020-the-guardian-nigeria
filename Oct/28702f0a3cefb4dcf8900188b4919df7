SOKAPU flays gov’s lukewarm stance in kidnap of council boss, others The delay by Governor Nasir el-Rufai of Kaduna State in announcing a new Emir of Zazzau in Zaria may lead to the balkanisation of the emirate.
Plans are underway, The Guardian gathered, to create more emirates from Zazzau as the state government is working on an executive bill that will reform the composition and classification of the state’s chieftaincy and traditional council. Besides, since the demise of the 19th Emir of Zazzau, Shehu Idris, the emirate and the state have been waiting patiently for a replacement to be announced by the governor. But things took a dramatic turn when the governor rejected three candidates submitted to him to choose from, and later ordered for a fresh list accommodating the remaining aspirants to the stool. The Guardian gathered that a bill was already underway to create three emirates under Zazzau. A source told journalists: “We will have the Magaji Gari Emirate, Zazzau Emirate and Kudan Emirate under the new proposition. “The name of Magaji Garin Zazzau, Ahmad Nuhu Bamali, is to be submitted as the new Emir of Magajin Gari; while the name of Yariman Zazzau, Munnir Ja’afaru, is to be submitted as the new Emir of Zazzau. The name of Iyan Zazzau, Bashir Aminu, will be submitted as the new Emir of Kudan Emirate.” Confirming the existence of the bill,  el-Rufai, during the presentation of the 2021 budget before the House of Assembly yesterday, stated that his administration was working on a chieftaincy and traditional council bill. SOUTHERN Kaduna Peoples Union (SOKAPU) have protested against the governor’s lukewarm attitude towards the kidnap of Kaura Council Chairman, Dr. Bege Katuga, and other natives of that part of the state. According to SOKAPU, since the council chairman and others were kidnapped by armed bandits, the government has not shown much concern over their release. The spokesman, Luka Binniyat, stated yesterday: “It has been over one week since gunmen abducted the Caretaker Committee Chairman of Kaura Council in Southern Kaduna, Dr. Bege Katuga, on his farm in Juji – a suburb of Kaduna town that falls under Chikun Council. “The commercial bike rider that conveyed him to the farm was gruesomely shot dead on the spot before the kidnappers disappeared with the chairman into the unknown.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
