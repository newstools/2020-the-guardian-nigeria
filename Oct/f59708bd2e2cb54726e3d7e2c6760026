The Committee on Works, Housing and Infrastructure Development of the Lagos State Assembly yesterday visited the disputed site for the proposed 19.39km road to link up Ijedodo, Ijegun and Abule-Addo in Iba Local Council Development Area (LCDA).
 
The community had been agitated following the marking of many houses on the project’s Right of Way (RoW). Affected residents were irked by the development, which they described as a total deviation from what is in the original Ijegun-Ijedodo-Abule Ado model city plan 2010-2020 as approved by the state government.
 
One of the affected residents, Mr Young Abokitia, who spoke with journalists during a protest over the issue last week, said: “The master-plan of the state government had delineated a particular place for the road project, but what the land grabbers are trying to do is out of the original plan. They want to change it to where the NNPC pipelines are laid. This is wrong and dangerous.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
