It was the famous 16th President of the United States of America (USA), Abraham Lincoln that said, “I walk slowly, but I never walk backward. ”Of a truth, Nigeria under President Buhari is moving forward steadily.
 
As Nigerians, we may assume we know what President Mohammadu Buhari, GCON will do next.

Checks reveal that the civil service has been virtually handcuffed due to erroneous appointments of Permanent Secretaries. The 2015 and 2017 appointments were deemed the most controversial because they allegedly produced ‘anointed’ Permanent Secretaries who were not the best in the stock. In 2015, the proverbial ‘Nigerian factor’ made it possible for mediocrity to hold sway as those ones were spared the rigours of the selection examinations. In 2017, those that emerged were said to have passed somehow!
