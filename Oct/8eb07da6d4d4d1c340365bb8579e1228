She said the latest deaths brought to 30,712 the total number of fatalities since Iran reported its first coronavirus cases in February. The previous record death toll for a day in Iran was 279 announced on Wednesday. Iran said the total number of infections in the country reached 534,631 on Monday, with 4,251 people testing positive in the past 24 hours. “The current situation is the result of neglecting to comply with health protocols, reduced use of masks and dangerous social behaviour in recent weeks,” Lari said. Deaths and infections from the virus have been on a rising trajectory in Iran and recorded several new highs since early September. The numbers were also likely to be higher than officially reported, Deputy Health Minister Iraj Harirchi acknowledged on Wednesday, primarily due to testing and reporting protocols. Tehran and four major cities were partially sealed off from Thursday to midday Sunday in a bid to dissuade Iranians from travelling during holidays. Authorities in the capital ordered the closure of most public places as of October 3. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
