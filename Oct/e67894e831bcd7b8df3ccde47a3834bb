In the 2019-20 NBA season concluding game in Orlando, Florida, LeBron James lifted the Larry O’Brien Trophy and was voted the NBA Finals MVP. The four-time NBA Champion has now won four championships with three-different franchises – Miami Heat (2012, 2013), Cleveland Cavaliers (2016), and LA Lakers (2020).
