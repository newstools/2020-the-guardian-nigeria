Speaking at his induction ceremony as the 53rd president of the club, Lampejo said apart from assisting the youths in the area of education, the club would also embark on health outreaches and initiatives to boost SMEs. He said this is in addition to the club’s sight project where beneficiaries were given free eyeglasses after free eye test, which included 39 students of Ikeja Junior High School. Guest speaker at the induction, Justice Bolaji Ojo of Ogun State High Court, charged members to take up the task of orientating the youths to imbibe good values and be less materialistic. He noted that this value should begin from home to stem the tide of many youths today chasing after ostentatious life and indulging in many illicit activities to fuel their taste.
 
The immediate past president, Muyiwa Fagbola, noted that the club won numerous awards and recognition in the 2019/2020 Rotary year and was adjudged as the second best club in District 9110.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
