Newly sworn in chairman of the Lagos State Chapter of the Imo State University Alumni Association (IMSU Alumni), Nze Chibueze Anukanti, has promised to revamp sports in the institution as part of his seven-point programme for the school. Anukanti, a Property Consultant and Managing Director of PWAN BAZAAR Properties Ltd, a subsidiary of the PWAN Group of Companies, whose executive committee was sworn in at the weekend in Ikeja, disclosed that sports development in the institution and other parts of the country was chief among his agenda.
 
He added that association was open to partnering with corporate entities to lift the standard of sports in the country. “It’s impossible for our new administration to achieve our goals without sports. We know the power of sports everywhere in the world and we will use it as one of our policies. “I will see how we can merge sports with other policies to revive the alumni. That is why sports is one of our seven points agenda,” he said. Anukanti disclosed that many past Lagos chapter chairmen embraced sports development, adding, “the likes of Enyioha Chris Anyanwu and Chinwe Mbakwem, among others, are past chapter chairmen, who adopted sports. “I am not sure we can do much without sports. We shall consult and design sports programmes and hopefully something great shall come out of it.” Apart from sports, he said other areas his administration will look into are administration restoring, working to set up a reconciliatory committee, bringing back aggrieved parties and organising seminars and workshops aimed at training and retraining of members.
