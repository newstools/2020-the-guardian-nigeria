Despite continued #EndSARS protest in major cities of the country, the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) closed flat yesterday as investors repositioned for the third quarter result release. At the close of transactions yesterday, the ASI closed at 28,659.45 as against Friday’s 28,658.31 while market capitalisation remained unchanged at N14,979 trillion. The Chief Research Officer of Investdata Consulting, Ambrose Omordion, said: “The nation’s stock market halted the bullish transition on profit booking on Monday as #EndSARS protests entered day 12, shutting down economic activities in major cities “The government’s lackadaisical attitude and distrust among the populace have kept the youth on the roads and streets as many state governments are presently considering the closure of schools over the continued protest.” Analysts at Afrinvest Limited said: “We are not optimistic about bullish performance in subsequent trading sessions due to weak investor sentiment. “However, investors may position in sound stocks ahead of Q3 earnings releases.” Market breadth was positive, with 19 gainers versus 18 losers.
