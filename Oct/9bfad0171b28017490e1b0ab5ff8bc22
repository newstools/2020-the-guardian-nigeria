Germany stands with France at this difficult time.” – ‘Vile attack’ –

We embrace the families of the victims and our French brothers.

A harder tone came from Hungary, where populist Prime Minister Viktor Orban wrote that the attack showed clearly “that our culture, our way of life and our European values are in the crosshairs of extremist terrorism. “We are ready to join forces in order to protect traditional European values and the traditional European way of life,” Orban added. Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, who previously governed with far-right ministers, called the murders in Nice “a despicable Islamist terror attack. “France has our full solidarity. We will defend our values and European ‘way of life’ with all our might against Islamists and political Islam,” Kurz said. – India, UK ‘stand with France’ –

The pontiff urged people in France, a multi-cultural society, to “unite to combat evil with good”. During talks with the Italian foreign minister, Israeli President Reuven Rivlin warned: “The attempt to foment war between religious is inconceivable. “There is no war between Christianity and Islam, or between Judaism and Islam and we must be sure that no one is allowed to make that happen.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
