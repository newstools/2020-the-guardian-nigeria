The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC’s) decision to facilitate the listing of MTN Nigeria on the country’s Stock Exchange market has continued to bring economic gains to Nigeria and Nigerians in terms of boosting market capitalisation and yielding dividends to shareholders, the Executive Vice Chairman (EVC) of the Commission, Prof. Umar Garba Danbatta, has said.
  
Market analysts report that MTN investors have raked in approximately N1 trillion in price appreciation and dividends since April 2020.  The listing of MTN was as a result of NCC’s effective regulatory action taken during the mobile network operator’s fine settlement agreement in 2016, which compelled the telco to, among other things, list on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE).
  
The listing was one of the outcomes of the NCC’s stringent regulatory posture, which served as a tonic for other telcos such as Airtel to follow the same direction.  “Also, one of the benefits of listing on the NSE is that telcos have enormous opportunity for raising more capital for network expansion, which will, in turn, bring about improvement in the quality of service delivery and quality of experience for telecom consumers,” he said.
  
He added, “Today, the capital market regulator and shareholder bodies have commended the effort of the NCC in making the capital market more resilient through the Commission’s regulatory action in facilitating telco’s listing.”
  
He noted that the listing in the Stock Exchange will promote liquidity amongst operators, enhance their value as well as promote transparency.
 
The EVC said the Commission is committed, through its regulatory policies and actions, to creating the right environment to attract both Foreign Direct Investment (FDIs), and local investment into the telecom industry for increased economic prosperity for Nigerians.
