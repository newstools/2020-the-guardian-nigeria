Observing the display of multi-coloured fireworks launched from 150 oak barrels floating on the Charente River; guests in Lagos were hosted in an exclusive location to bask in the celebration as the fireworks presentation exhibited each act with spectacular flair leaving all in awe. Commenting on the event, General Manager of Moët Hennessy, Sebastian Chouen said: “Celebrating our 150th anniversary embodies all that Maurice Hennessy, the creator of this iconic carafe put into creating this blend, and it has been an honour for us to collaborate with Guo-Quiang.” “World Odyssey sought to convey the duality of this period, through the difficulties the opportunities to celebrate remain, and we’ll continue to be a worthy companion. Recent global events have reminded us of the most positive attributes of human nature, our capacity to hope, persist and to remain optimistic in trying times,” he added. Guo-Qiang’s career has been marked by his creative take on contemporary social issues, and in this collaboration, he took inspiration from the three core elements of the cycle of life, creation, destruction, and the human spirit that imbibes resilience.
