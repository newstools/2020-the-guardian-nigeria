An All Progressives Congress (APC) chieftain in Ekiti, Otunba Olusegun Agbalajobi, has called for a drastic reduction in the cost of governance to fight the hydra-headed problems of unemployment, poverty and infrastructure deficit in the country. In a statement titled: “Governors, Senators’ Humongous Salaries Killing Nigerians”, the former gubernatorial aspirant lamented that Nigeria’s politicians were being overpaid at the detriment of the masses that swim in abject poverty. Agbalajobi said the most populous black nation could reduce its spending by cutting down the “prodigious salaries of the governors, members of the National Assembly and political appointees.” He argued that occupants of public offices in this part of the world earn much more than counterparts in other climes. The APC stalwart stressed the need for urgent steps to be taken to reduce the overhead, stating that the nation “does not have the money to sustain the kind of over -bloated government it runs.” He, however, called on the unemployed youths to demand the pay cuts for job creation and infrastructure and development. IN a related development, campaigners in Abia State have demanded another national mass protest tagged #End Bogus Salaries and Allowances of National Lawmakers once the current one is settled. One of them, John Oke, told The Guardian: “One thing is  ending SARS, another problem is re-organising the police.” Another and an unemployed graduate for six years, Keka Kalu, queried the “high sounding salary and allowances reportedly being paid to lawmakers.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
