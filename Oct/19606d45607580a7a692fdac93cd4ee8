Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has urged victims of domestic violence and sexual abuse not to be afraid to speak out or seek help, saying the state government would ensure that perpetrators of such heinous crimes are prosecuted. The governor, who spoke at the closing ceremony of the 20th edition of the National Women Conference of the Committee of Wives of Lagos State Officials (COWLSO), which was held virtually, vowed that his administration would do everything possible to ensure that victims of domestic violence and sexual abuse expeditiously get the necessary support to overcome the psychological trauma associated with such abuses. He commended COWLSO for playing up the issue of domestic violence and rape through the conference, noting that the state government would remain committed to the implementation of the Child Rights Act. “Let me assure you that our administration remains committed to the implementation of the Child Rights Act and we will continue to maintain a zero tolerance for sexual and domestic violence. “We will not relent until child abuse, domestic violence and other related acts are totally eradicated in our communities and in Lagos State as a whole. All the perpetrators will be prosecuted and victims will expeditiously get the necessary support to overcome the psychological trauma associated with the abuse,” he said.
