However, NAN gathered that Muhammad-Bande, who successfully completed his tenure as the President of the UNGA74 in  September, was in the villa to thank the president for his support throughout his tenure. Buhari had in a statement by his spokesman, Malam Garba Shehu, on Sept. 28, congratulated Muhammad-Bande for the successful tenure as president of the UNGA74. The president, who described his tenure as “triumphant,” said: “Your performance in the last one year as President of the General Assembly has made Nigeria exceptionally proud, and I wish to pay glowing tributes to you for your huge achievements as Permanent Representative of Nigeria to the United Nations (UN). “By this stellar performance, you have made history for Nigeria and indeed for the whole of Africa.” Buhari also noted that the Permanent Representative “played a cardinal role by giving impetus to a number of UN global initiatives, one of which is advancing the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) particularly in poverty eradication, zero hunger and quality education”. NAN reports that Muhammed-Bande, later, joined the president to perform the two-raka’at Friday prayer at the Aso Villa Mosque.
