The Sun newspaper published the video, which appears to show the three players at a gathering in London with more than six people present on Saturday. It comes a month after Phil Foden and Mason Greenwood were sent home for breaching Covd-19 protocols while with Gareth Southgate’s England squad in Iceland. The Sun reports that the FA has seen footage of the party and quotes a spokesman as saying: “There will be no change to the England team at this stage.” The England squad is due to assemble this week ahead of a friendly against Wales on Thursday and Nations League matches against Belgium and Denmark. Chelsea pair Abraham and Chilwell and Borussia Dortmund’s Sancho are all in the 30-man group. It was reported the party was organised as a surprise gathering for Abraham’s 23rd birthday. The forward has apologised, telling the newspaper: “I arrived home to find a small surprise gathering. “Though I was totally unaware this was planned, I would like to wholeheartedly apologise for the naivety shown for the organisation and attending of this gathering. “All I can do now is learn from it, apologise to everyone and ensure it never happens again.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
