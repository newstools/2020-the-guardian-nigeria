Vice-Presidential Candidate of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the last general election, Mr. Peter Obi, has inaugurated a five-billion naira development fund to address infrastructure challenges in the University of Nigeria, Nsukka. Obi, an alumnus of the university of the class of 1984, inaugurated the capital campaign at the 60th Founders’ Day celebration of the premier university where he featured as the guest lecturer. The former governor had frowned at the pace of development in the university, stating that alumni of the institution had done very little or nothing to help their Alma Mater. He said that the fund raising campaign would run for a period of five years with a target mobilisation of one billion naira annually from alumni of the university effective from 2021. “If about 10,000 alumni of the university can come together and make annual contribution of N100, 000.00 each, we should be able to raise one billion yearly to help our Alma Meter,” the former governor said. Obi, who promised to pay two percent of annual fund mobilization, said that he would make funds available to the management of the university to furnish office apartment from where the fund drive would be coordinated and judiciously utilized. “I will be fully involved and will personally supervise activities of the office,” he promised. The Vice-Chancellor of the University, Prof Charles Igwe, had lamented the deplorable state of infrastructure in the university, stating that at 60, existing infrastructure had aged and deteriorated and therefore required urgent facelift. Igwe noted that the University of Nigeria was the only first generation university in the country without a Senate building.
