The Association of Nigerian Licensed Customs Agents (ANLCA), has urged its members to keep their compliance level high and shun illegalities that would place them on the wrong side of the law.
  
The President of the Association, Iju Tony, disclosed this during the inauguration of the newly elected executives of the Aminu Kano International Airport, Kano; Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja; and Muritala Mohammed International Airport Wing, Lagos Chapters.  He said the chapters, zones, and national bodies are not the exclusive fiefdom of any former officer or godfather while adding that elected officers owe allegiance to the Association’s constitution and recognised organs of hierarchy as constitutionally outlined.
