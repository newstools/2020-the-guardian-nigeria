Austria’s Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg is self-isolating after testing positive for Covid-19, his ministry said Saturday, as the country posted a new daily record for infections. Schallenberg could have contracted coronavirus during a meeting of European Union foreign ministers in Luxembourg on Monday, a foreign ministry spokeswoman told the APA news agency. “He has not presented any symptoms so far,” he said. The minister has cancelled a trip planned for the coming days to Britain, Denmark, Greece and Cyprus. All members of the conservative government of Chancellor Sebastian Kurz will be tested as a precaution on Saturday. Austria reported a new high of 2,300 cases on Saturday. With a population of 8.8 million, Austria has also recorded 882 deaths since the start of the pandemic. Schallenberg is just the latest in a string of politicians to contract the disease, including US President Donald Trump, Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
