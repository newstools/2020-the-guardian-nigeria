 People rally outside the Nigerian High Commission in central London on October 25, 2020, in support of protesters in Nigeria demonstrating against police brutality. – Peaceful demonstrations against police brutality erupted in Nigeria on October 8 and quickly snowballed into one of the biggest challenges to the ruling elite in decades. Chaos spiralled after security forces on October 20 opened fire on peaceful demonstrators in the centre of Lagos, unleashing days of rioting across Africa’s biggest city. Amnesty International has said at least 12 protesters were shot dead by the army and police in Lagos on October 20, and a total of 56 people have died since the demonstrations began.
