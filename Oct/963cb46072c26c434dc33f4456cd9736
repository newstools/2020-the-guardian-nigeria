The Teachers Registration Council of Nigeria (TRCN) is going after unqualified teachers in public and private schools nationwide. The Registrar, Prof. Josiah Ajiboye who disclosed this to reporters said the council will swing into action once schools fully reopen. He said despite the grace period given to teachers to rectify their certificates, there were still records of many unqualified ones. Prof Ajiboye said of the four million in various institutions in Nigeria, just over two million were registered with the council. â€œWe have about 2.2 million teachers registered with TRCN but the figure is still extremely low. From available statistics, we have about four million teachers in the country. We are checking if they are qualified before talking about registration. We started in February before the lockdown.
