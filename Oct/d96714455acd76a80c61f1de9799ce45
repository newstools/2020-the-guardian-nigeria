The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), has raised its global oil demand forecast for 2020 by 60,000 barrels per day (b/d) from last month to 90.29 million b/d in October, as it sees an improvement in China’s demand for most oil products except for jet fuel.
   
“China so far appears to be the only country globally moving steadily on the path to recovery based on gradually improving economic indicators, particularly in industrial production, which are rising from month to month,” OPEC said in its latest monthly oil market report released yesterday. “Oil demand is projected to be in line with these positive developments and trends.”
 
The bloc produced 24.11 million b/d in September, the report found, with the third quarter (Q3) average at 23.8 million b/d, or 600,000 b/d lower than demand for its crude, indicating room for OPEC, and its partners to maintain their relaxed quotas going into 2021. Its output had been above demand for its crude in Q1 and Q2, it said.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
