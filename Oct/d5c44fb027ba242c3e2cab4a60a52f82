The party at a meeting, which was convened at the instance of the party’s National Leader and Chairman, Board of Trustees (BoT), Alhaji Balarabe Musa, and attended by many state party chairmen and secretaries, Prof Suleiman Bello was equally appointed the interim chairman. In the communiqué issued and signed by the chairperson, PRP, Cross Rivers State, Elizabeth Esu and leader of Katsina delegates, Shehu Isa Kaita, the party stated that “after extensive deliberations, the Falalu Bello’s led administration was found incapable of steering the affairs of the party”, noting,”it “demonstrated lack of good faith for the Party on the part of Falalu Bello and his associates, which is expressed in the forms of disregard and disrespect for the party’s decisions, assignments, constitution, ideology and leadership, in addition to a standing desire to promote divisions, strife and destruction in the rank and file of the party.” Esu said: “Above all is the ill-will against the party, further demonstrated in the numerous illegalities being perpetrated by the Falalu-led administration.  It is also fully expressed in a so-called Programme of Party Activities being circulated by the same group of people, even though no such decisions were ever arrived at through consultations and discussions with all the leading organs of the party, or its general membership.” The PRP added that the former Chairman, after “September 1, 2020, has no legal basis as the Falalu Bello-led National Executive Committee (NEC) has ceased to exist with the expiration of its term on December 16, 2019 this is coupled with its failure to conduct the National Convention of the Party on, or before December 16, 2019 as mandated by the September 2018 National Delegate Conference (NDC) of the PRP.” Consequently, PRP stated, “the party members have unanimously passed a vote-of-no-confidence on Falalu Bello’s led administration.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
