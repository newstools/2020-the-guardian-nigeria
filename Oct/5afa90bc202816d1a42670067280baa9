The #EndSARS protesters are set to elect their leaders across the country, just few days after President Muhammadu Buhari’s speech, which has been widely censured for its content. A group, suspected to be in the protest, disclosed to The Guardian that provision had been made for online voting via Google form. Buhari had last week Thursday appealed to the youths to discontinue the protests, noting that their demands had been noted and would soon be attended to. However, he did not mention the killing of unarmed protesters at Lekki Tollgate, Lagos State, let alone offering apologies. Not satisfied with the President’s offer, the coalition of protest groups across Nigeria, in a statement, noted that the struggle must continue but with a new strategy. Nominees for the election include Folarin Falana (a.k.a. Falz), Aisha Yesufu, Timi Dakolo, Feyikemi Abudu, Editi Effiong and rap artiste, Jude Abaga (a.k,a, MI). Former education minister, Oby Ezekwesili; a pastor, Sam Adeyemi; as well as Ibukun Awosika and Amina Salihu, are listed among nominees as advisers.
MEANWHILE, the Delta State Police Commissioner, Hafiz Inuwa, has appealed to the protesters to discontinue, saying his command would implement whatever decision reached by the Federal Government to reform the police. Inuwa, in a statement endorsed by his image-maker, DSP Onome Onovughagbogaya, called on Deltans and residents in the state to join the police in their quest to keep the peace in the state. While suing for partnership with all stakeholders, the police boss enjoined them to abide by the law and obey the state government’s directive on the curfew. He promised to ensure amicable resolution of the social unrest and advised all to embrace peace.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
