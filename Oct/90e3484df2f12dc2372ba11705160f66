• FAAN remits N8.7 billion in six years The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN), has blamed unviable airports scattered nationwide for its poor earnings and revenue shortfall over the years, now in excess of N65 billion.
  
Management of FAAN, while appearing before the House of Representatives’ Committee on Finance, in Abuja, reaffirmed that a total of 18 out of the 22 airports under its operations are unviable.
  
The Guardian earlier reported that at least 17 of the 20 airports owned and managed by the Federal Government were unviable and operated at losses for three years on the bounce.  Similarly, Sokoto Airport had a total of N725.7 million generated revenue, out of which N400.1 million was collected. The cost of operation was in excess of N2.71 billion, which gave a shortage of N2.31 billion. In the South, Ibadan airport in three years raked in a total of N349.2 million in generated revenue. N244.9 million was collected. Expenditure amounts to N1.39 billion and deficit totalled N1.14 billion.
  
Ilorin International Airport made a total of N437.1 million generated revenue in three years. A total of N264.2 million was collected. Expenditure was in excess of N2.453 billion, giving a shortfall of N2.19 billion.
  
Having listened to the defense by FAAN MD, the legislators still insisted in casting a glance at the financial records of FAAN, especially on its revenue and expenditures, to be able to appreciate whatever the compelling reason for not meeting up with remittance targets.
