Back in March, Styles revealed on BBC radio 1Xtra Residency that he was using the extra time in quarantine to learn some Italian. “It’s a little difficult but it’s all right — I’m lucky I’m with friends in our little safe self-isolation pod. It’s a very strange time but we’re just being careful, listening to music, playing games, doing some face masks — you know, the classic quarantine stuff!”
