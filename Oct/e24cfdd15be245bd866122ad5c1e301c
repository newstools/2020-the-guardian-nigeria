This is 4% of all cases reported globally. Since the last brief, 69,922 new COVID-19 cases have been reported, which is a 6% increase in the number of new cases reported when compared to the 13 October 2020 brief. The proportion of new COVID-19 cases by AU region is as follows: 58% from the Northern region (40,574 cases; 6% increase from previous week), 23% from the Southern region (15,979; 10% increase), 13% from the Eastern region (9,393; 2% increase), 5% from the Western region (3,356; 8% increase) and 1% from the Central region (626; 3% decrease). Six countries account for approximately 86% of the new COVID-19 cases reported since the last brief: Morocco (32%), South Africa (17%), Tunisia (15%), Libya (9%), Ethiopia (8%), and Kenya (5%). Countries reporting the highest incidence (COVID-19 cases per 100,000 population) over the past seven days in Africa include Cabo Verde (118), Libya (97), Tunisia (96), Morocco (52), South Africa (19), Namibia (12) and Sao-Tome (8). Of the countries actively reporting COVID-19 epidemiologic data, thirteen countries are reporting case fatality rates higher than the global case fatality rate of 2.8%, These include Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (7.1%), Chad (6.7%), Sudan (6.1%), Liberia (5.9%), Egypt (5.8), Niger (5.7%), Mali (3.9%), Algeria (3.4%), Angola (3.2%), Gambia (3.2%), Sierra Leone (3.1%) and Malawi (3.1%). Table 1 highlights the reported cases and deaths from COVID-19 in all countries in Africa. In addition, the table reports the current phase of the epidemic for each country. Figure 1 shows the trend of new COVID-19 cases reported by day and region from 29 February to date. We observed a decline in the daily new cases being reported in Africa during the month of July and August, mostly influenced by South Africa. During the month of October, there has been a slight increase in the number of new cases being reported. The countries (i.e. Libya, Morocco, and Tunisia) in the Northern region along with are contributing in recent weeks. Table 1.
