The Senior Staff Association of Nigeria Polytechnics (SSANIP) has hinted that it was considering joining the on-going strike embarked upon by the non-teaching staff members of the nation’s universities. It said its decision to join the strike was not unconnected with the challenges associated with the implementation of the Integrated Personnel and Payroll Information System (IPPIS) and stoppage of minimum wage. Speaking at the end of its National Executive Council (NEC) meeting in Abuja yesterday, National President of SSANIP, Philip Ogunsipe, said since the implementation of IPPIS in February 2020, its members have not been paid the new minimum wage arrears. He revealed that there had been inconsistencies in the release of third party deductions, non-payment of COVID-19 hazard allowance to health workers, high draconian tax regime on consolidated salary, as well as delay in the release of 2018 and 2019 promotion arrears, among others. A communiqué issued at the end of the parley, SSANIP gave a 21-day ultimatum for government to address the issues, failing which it may have no other option than to embark on strike.
