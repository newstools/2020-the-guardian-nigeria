The Director-General of UNESCO, Audrey Azoulay, will pay an official visit to the Republic of the Congo and to the Democratic Republic of the Congo on 14 and 15 October to reiterate the importance of returning to school with a focus on girls' education.  “The progress achieved in education—girls’ education in particular—must not be lost to the pandemic,” argues the Director-General, “Now more than ever, girls’ education, and their effective return to school, must be a priority.”  Ms Azoulay will visit schools in both countries, where she will inaugurate distance learning tools and interact with pupils, students and teachers.  More than 1.6 billion students around the world were suddenly deprived of schools during the COVID crisis. In the framework of the Global Coalition for Education launched last March, UNESCO has supported countries in finding appropriate solutions and ensuring the continuity of education, a cornerstone of equality and development, especially for girls and women. Supported by 150 partners from very diverse backgrounds, the Global Coalition for Education has made it possible to set up concrete distance learning solutions and to support 400 million pupils throughout the world and nearly 13 million teachers.
