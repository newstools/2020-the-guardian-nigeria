The protest against police brutality was violent on Monday when protesters descended on some policemen attached to the Rapid Response Squad (RRS) of the Lagos State Command at Adekunle Police station, Yaba, around 10:00 am. The attack occurred when about 97 policemen, who were being conveyed to their various beats on routine relief duties across the state, came across the violent protesters who started shouting “No Police, No Police”, and stoned them. After the attacks, 19 of them were critically injured while 4 police vehicles were damaged. Police spokesman, Muyiwa Adejobi, said “the policemen, who scampered for safety, were eventually rescued and rushed to the Police Clinic at Panti, Yaba, for medical attention. “The Commissioner of Police Lagos State, CP Hakeem Odumosu, has condemned the attack and urged officers and men of the command to remain calm while they continue to manage the situation professionally, as usual in the state. “He further appealed to community leaders, parents and guardians, traditional rulers and religious leaders, to caution the youths against violence and any act that is capable of aggravating tension in the state as such would be counter-productive.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
