The headquarters of the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), has been set ablaze by hoodlums who invaded the premises, chased out the workers before set the facilities on fire. The building was razed as the NPA fire fighters run for their dear lives and therefore unable to arrest the inferno. A staff of the authority confirmed to The Guardian that the hoodlums also attacked the NPA facility in Dockyard, Apapa and carted away valuable items.
