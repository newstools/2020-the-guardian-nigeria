 Barcelona and Super Falcons attacker, Asisat Oshoala.Photo: FIFA.com  Oshoala incurred the wrath of Nigerians following her controversial tweet, ‘Nigeria is a jungle’ on Sunday. But in a series of tweets later, Oshoala suggested her statement was taken out of context, adding, however, she loves Nigeria but is only unhappy with some present developments. She wrote: “I love Nigeria, Nigeria has given me everything even if it wasn’t in the easiest way. That is why I will also give my all in my own little way… make it easier for the next generation. Na all of us gather love this country but not happy.” She continues: “I made a tweet on Sunday about Nigeria being a jungle. I did that in relation to the #EndSARS protest and not the country at large. “I was clearly saying Nigeria isn’t for the weak, you have to be really strong and very confident…Don’t get it twisted, I love this country as y’all do hence reason for my outburst. I love this country and will not run away.” Oshoala, who was named best player and was the highest goal scorer at the 2014 FIFA U-20 Women’s World Cup, has won the African best footballer of the year award four times.
