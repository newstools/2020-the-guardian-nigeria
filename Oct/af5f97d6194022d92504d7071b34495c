Members of the Police Community Relations Committee (PCRC) in Ijegun area of Lagos State have commended residents and youths of the area for stoutly defending the vandalisation and burning of the Isheri-Oshun Police Station last week by some hoodlums.
 
It was a week of rage and carnage in the state as arsonists unleashed terror on public and private facilities, most especially police stations.
 
Narrating how genuine collaboration between the Divisional Police Officer (DPO) of the station, SP Wole Oyedele and the community saved the facility from being destroyed, Isheri-Oshun PCRC Chairman, Chief Ganiyu Bamidele, said: “The #EndSARS protesters first came to the Isheri-Oshun division on Monday, October 19, where the DPO, Wole Oyedele, engaged and advised them to carry out their protest peacefully.
