Demands justice for Lekki protesters
Lead Pastor of The Elevation Church (TEC), Godman Akinlabi, has charged Nigerian leaders on good governance, while the Christian faithful equip themselves with accurate and verified information to hold the government accountable for their inaction. This is even as he reiterated that Christians would not allow the nation to sink through bad leadership, as the role of the church is to be the conscience of the nation and the voice of the people as a collaborator for good governance. Akinlabi, who spoke during an online programme tagged, “Radical Transformation II,” urged the church to demand justice, equity, and accountability in leadership from the government. While describing the ongoing protests in Nigeria, as the birth of something new, he demanded justice for those that lost their lives during the peaceful #EndSARS at the Lekki toll gate. He called on President Buhari to respond to the situation and prosecute those involved in this dastardly act. He lamented that “Up till now, our nation has not been able to speak out on who authorised the assault and possibly killings of peaceful protesters and we need to demand justice. We know a new nation is about to be birthed. However, every birth will come with some pains, but we can always minimise the pains. We are praying that God will minimise our pains at this time. “God is using the young people of Nigeria to push for something new, for their rights to life, for a life of peaceful existence, for the commonwealth of the nation, for development, for good governance, for good leadership and an end to police brutality in the nation. “The church is the conscience of the nation, and by implication we should be the conscience of the government. We will hold the government accountable until we see that the right thing is being done.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
