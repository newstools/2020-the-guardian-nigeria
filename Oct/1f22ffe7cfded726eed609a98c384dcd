The former Manchester United and England captain, now player-coach at Derby, was visited by a friend who had been instructed to be tested for Covid-19 and was later found to have the disease. In a statement on Twitter, Rooney said: “Just received the news that my Covid-19 test has shown I do not have the virus. “Delighted for myself and family but obviously angry and disappointed that I now have to self-isolate and miss vital games for @dcfcofficial.” The Sun newspaper reported on Sunday that the 34-year-old was angry after his friend visited him at his home on Thursday to give him a watch even though he should have been self-isolating. The friend later returned a positive test. Rooney was unaware of any Covid-related concerns and played in Derby’s 1-0 home loss to Watford a day after the visit, on Friday.
