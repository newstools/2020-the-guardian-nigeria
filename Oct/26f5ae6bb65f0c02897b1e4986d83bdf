Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has granted state pardon to a popular actress, Mrs Funke Akindele-Bello and her husband, Mr. Abdulrasheed Bello, who were both non-custodial convicts for offences related to the disobedience of COVID-19 lockdown regulations. The governor also approved the release of 56 inmates from various Correctional Centres in the state. The State Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice, Mr. Moyosore Onigbanjo (SAN), disclosed this yesterday. According to Onigbanjo, Sanwo-Olu acted based on the recommendations of the State Advisory Council on Prerogative of Mercy, under the powers conferred on him by Section 212 (1) & (2) of the 1999 Constitution as amended. In a statement signed by Director, Public Affairs, Ministry of Justice, Mr Kayode Oyekanmi, the Attorney-General said the 56 released inmates were recommended by the Advisory Council after due examination of their case files, consideration of the length of time served, the gravity of offence, old age and ill-health, among other parameters. He enjoined the beneficiaries to be good citizens and stay away from crime.  It could be recalled that Sanwo-Olu inaugurated the eight-member Advisory Council on Prerogative of Mercy headed by Dr. Abayomi Finnih in December 2019.
