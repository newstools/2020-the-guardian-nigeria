Candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) for October 31, 2020 Lagos East Senatorial District bye-election, Mr. Tokunbo Abiru, has promised to set up an endowment to alleviate poverty and reduce unemployment in the district if elected. Abiru, who also pledged quality representation for the people of the district, said he would promote legislations that would improve the quality of life for the people of Lagos East. He made the promises, yesterday, at a meeting with stakeholders, such as the Nigeria Union of Teachers (NUT), Nigeria Union of Local Government Employees (NULGE), National Union of Road Transport Workers, National Association of Persons with Physical Disabilities, Community Development Associations (CDAs) and National Youth Council of Nigeria (NYCN), in Ikorodu. At the public engagement, residents, including community leaders, traditional rulers and youth leaders asked diverse questions about the deplorable state of roads, public schools and an unacceptable rate of poverty nationwide. Responding, Abiru acknowledged the sorry level of poverty in the country, which he said, could only be effectively fought from corporate, individual and pubic fronts. Abiru promised that he would set up an endowment “to alleviate poverty and reduce unemployment in Lagos East, even in Lagos State.” Besides setting an endowment that would focus on poverty alleviation, youth empowerment, employment generation and gender balancing, the APC candidate pledged quality representation. He, therefore, assured the people of Lagos East that he would, first and foremost, prioritise their welfare and well-being.
