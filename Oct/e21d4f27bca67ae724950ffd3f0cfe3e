 A SPAR mall looted in Lagos.									            Source: Nairametrics  Grieved by the loss of lives, property, and livelihoods triggered by recent peaceful EndSARS protests, the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), has urged banks to be compassionate to looted businesses that are indebted to them.  She added that the move has become necessary in view of the current challenging economic conditions that the state was already grappling with.  Without adequate compensation, operators had noted that many businesses might not recover while unemployment is expected to rise further.
 
The LCCI said: “We bemoan the unprecedented levels of destruction, plundering, arson, looting and vandalism that took place, which even with the caution that we expressed in our press statement on Monday the 19th of October, we could not have imagined. This is one of the darkest moments in our recent history.” It also empathised with all the families who lost their loved ones, during and in the aftermath of the protests as well as all investors: micro, small, medium, and large that suffered losses as a result of the arson, looting, and destruction of their valuable fixed and moveable assets.
   
The Chamber added, “We share the grave concern of employees who are at the risk of losing their jobs as a result of these deplorable and debilitating incidents. We empathise with the Lagos State Government over the wanton destruction of public properties around the state.
   
“We also empathise with the Oba of Lagos, His Royal Majesty, Oba Rilwan Akiolu, and the entire indigenes of the state over the regrettable desecration of an important and treasured symbol of Lagos heritage, culture, and tradition.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
