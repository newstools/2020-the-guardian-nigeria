Ekiti State Governor, Kayode Fayemi, has said the efforts of his administration towards restoring the core values for which the state was noted as well as excellence in public sector have started to yield results. According to him, the results could be measured by the level of hard work, integrity and excellence being displayed by many Ekiti sons and daughters in their areas of endeavours, including the public service. The governor spoke yesterday when he received the recipient of the National Best Teachers’ Award (Secondary School category), Mr Olaoluwa Asubiojo, in his office in Ado Ekiti. Asubiojo, a Physics Teacher at Amoye Grammar School, Ikere Ekiti, who won the national award earlier in the week in Abuja, was the best teacher in Ekiti State (secondary school category) in 2019. Fayemi, who hailed Asubiojo’s brilliance and dedication to duty, said his administration would not shift attention from the restoration of the ethical values that promote ethical conduct, proper behaviours, diligence and hardworking in the state. In his response, Asubiojo, who was accompanied by his wife, attributed his success to the grace of God and the past efforts he had put into his teaching career. He stated that the award would spur him to put more efforts in making positive impact on the lives of his students.
