Nweke A former President, National Association of Government Approved Freight Forwarders (NAGAFF), Eugene Nweke, has urged the Board of Council for Regulation of Freight Forwarding in Nigeria (CRFFN), to intervene in the ongoing administrative brawl in the Association of Nigeria Licensed Customs Agents (ANLCA). Nweke, who expressed disappointment at the attack on the ANLCA Secretariat, where several valuables were destroyed with a police inspector injured, said the ANLCA leadership brouhaha has opened up a new fiesta of internal regulatory shortcomings, calling for a review of extant regulations. Nweke told The Guardian that for the crisis to have lasted this long without any form of external intervention from the CRFFN is a huge administrative limitation. It is also an exposé of inadequate supervisory measures and internal reconciliatory mechanism, thereby casting a serious question on regulatory oversight on every professional, including the Governing Council members. He said: “The CRFFN has been interpreted as an agency of the Federal Ministry of Transportation (FMOT), like other agencies under the FMOT. At this point, the essence of accrediting ANLCA as professional freight forwarding association, which hitherto signed an oath of allegiance to the CRFFN comes to the fore, mostly so, in the face of professional bestowment on associations leadership to consciously exhibit professional norms, transparency, accountability and tranquillity at all times. Nweke, however, called on the aggrieved leaders to embrace peace, saying: “I encourage all to collectively put their hands in the hand of God like little children, and refrain from all forms of scripted evil plans and vices, including all forms of calumnies, protests, solidarity show among others, against each other, but rather, allow God to lead you all out into the bright sunshine of God’s love.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
