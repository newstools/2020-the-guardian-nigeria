It is an anomaly to refer to state chief executives as chief security officers of their respective states while they lack the constitutional powers to control the Unit under their command. These sentiments were reechoed by the Governor of Oyo State, Mr. Seyi Makinde when he voiced his frustrations at the weekend over the killing of one Jimoh Isiaka, who was involved in the #EndSARS protest in the state by members of the police force who were alleged to have engaged the protesters with live ammunitions, leading to his death and the injury of at least five others. It stands to reason, therefore, that the challenges in all the nooks and crannies of the states cannot be addressed by one man tucked far away in the nation’s capital, as adequate policing in a federal system requires the operation of decentralised units.
 
Certainly, Nigerians deserve more than a rhetoric each time a measure of good governance is demanded of its government. And so, this administration needs to do more in the areas of good governance if it hopes to preserve what’s left of its fast receding goodwill. It must follow through with the promised reforms, as that’s the only way Nigerians can be assured that the lives that were lost by some young Nigerians in the cause of the #EndSARS protests were not in vain.   
 
If there’s any lesson to be learnt from the #EndSARS protest, it is the knowledge that ultimate power rests with the electorates, as such Nigerians must be persistent in their quest for good governance by the elect and demand more of elected officers, for this is the beauty of the democratic system of government.
