While building the capacity of non-oil exporters is key for market penetration, the country needs a national carrier to further improve its chances of entering new markets and deepening non-oil export growth, the Nigerian Export Promotion Council (NEPC) and other operators have said.
   
Indeed, the Chief Executive Officer, Free on Board (FOB) Global Logistics Limited, Oluwajimi Adebakin, said the Federal Government’s quest to drive non-oil export would be hampered without a national carrier, noting that exportation of non-oil products is affected by huge freight cost.  Also speaking, the Chief Executive Officer, Nigerian Export Promotion Council (NEPC), Olusegun Awolowo, represented by the Regional Coordinator, NEPC South West Region, Samuel Oyeyipo, said the Council is building the capacity of Nigerian exporters to meet global standards. “The essence of our presence is to ensure that locally-made products find their way to the international market. We are not just assisting people to grow in non-oil export, but also assuring that the processes and documentation of export are well taken care of to facilitate international trade,” he said.
   
He added: “We are building capacities of our exporters here so that they can meet standards because if they do not meet standards of the importer, there is little or nothing we can do when the goods arrive at the point of entry. We are presently building capacities and competencies for exporters to meet the required and also the need to acquire the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP), which is a worldwide non-mandatory certification.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
