#EndSARS: Protesters Brings Back The Lost Okoroshi In Lekki Protest The protesters at Lekki have brought back the “lost Okoroshi” to the protest ground this morning in the fight against the Federal Special Anti-Robbery Squad, F-SARS, brutality. On Tuesday, while requesting for the end of police brutality, a masquerade was sighted dancing with a placard saying “Stop killing our dreamers, EndSARS Now”. Okoroshi, Okoroshi Ojo and Okoroshi Oma represent the dualities of good/evil, female/male, white clouds/dark rain clouds, beauty/distortion, delicate features/large misshapen features, village/wilderness, order/chaos, clarity/mystery in Igbo tradition. However, “The lost Okoroshi” is a movie by Abba Makama and it focuses on the semi-comic tale of spiritual possession. Symbolically, the Okoroshi is meant to protect the weak and fight against injustice. This is what the coming out of the masked dancer for the Lekki protest signify. People were happy to see this development, it shows a cultural unification in the fight against police and also a knowledge of the traditional system by the millenials.
