The Village Market is deploying technology to eliminate middlemen regarded as the major factor responsible for the high cost of foodstuff and other agro commodities in the country.
  
The Founder of Village Market, an e-market platform, Mrs Aderemi Olanrewaju Sanni-Banjo, who made this assertion during an exhibition organised by the firm in Lagos, said the activities of the middlemen in the process of bringing produce from the villages to urban centres have massively impacted prices of foodstuff. 
  
Sanni-Banjo said the concept of Village market is to eliminate the middlemen by connecting farmers in the villages and bringing farm produce to Lagos at cheaper rates.  “Everyone is talking about ‘new normal,’ but we are looking at ‘Better normal.’ We want to move from new normal to better normal, the fact that our open markets are not well organised, and the long distance to get to the markets, to us we think this is the better normal for us to latch-on. “Most of our young people are now working from home, they don’t have time to go to the market, many of our mothers, this is the best thing anybody could do for now.”
  
Sanni-Banjo, however, said the major challenge confronting online marketing is the fact that not too many people have access to the Internet,” the cost of internet as well, low level of literacy and lack of integrity, among others.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
