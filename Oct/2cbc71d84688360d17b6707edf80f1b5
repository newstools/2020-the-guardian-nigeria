He urged Buhari to err on the side of the law by abiding with relevant provisions of the recently signed Nigeria Police Force (Establishment) Bill 2020. Hercules added that the call was key to righting prevailing lapses in consonance to current global policing measures. The letter, which was obtained by The Guardian, read in part: “Our dear President, you just signed the Nigeria Police Force (Establishment) Bill, 2020 (Harmonised) into law. Sir, with due respect, how about changing the narrative?” The incumbent IGP will by February 1, 2021, serve the statutory 35 years of service, and also attain the age of 60 in the same year. He has done his best, and Nigeria is immensely grateful. “ Sir, the bill you have signed into law does not allow for the extension of service in my humble opinion. Section 18 (8) says: Every police officer shall, on recruitment or appointment, serve in the Nigeria Police Force for a period of 35 years or until he attains the age of 60 years, whichever is earlier.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
