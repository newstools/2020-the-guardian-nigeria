• Metering firm to deploy over 400,000 meters for DisCos Meter manufacturing and serving firms in Nigeria have attributed the slow pace of mass metering under the Meter Asset Provider (MAP) scheme to the inability to access foreign exchange and import levy charged on pre-paid meters.
   
According to them, the existing in-country capacity for local manufacturing and assembly of components is not sufficient to meet the huge demand for prepaid meters by electricity customers, hence the need for operators to resort to importation.
   
Besides, New Hampshire Metering Services Limited, a subsidiary of New Hampshire Capital Limited, has announced immediate plans to roll-out over 404,000 smart prepaid meters for Ikeja and Ibadan electricity distribution companies (DisCos) under the MAP scheme.  Omoyeni said the company’s MAP operations currently provide direct employment for over 400 meter installers and field engineers, who handle meter maintenance and repairs.
   
According to, “we would engage more than 1,000 trained meter installers when we fully commence our mass metering roll-out”. “The company has been able to build capacity using local workforce and youths within our areas of operation and enjoy significant support from our host communities who are major beneficiaries of our local labour recruitment”, he said.
   
He also lauded the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN’s) new meter-financing framework, but urged alignment with the existing MAP regulation to achieve set objectives and goals and finally close the metering gap.
   
He opined that the CBN’s plan to provide long term financing to local meter manufacturers would help them expand their present capacity, and in addition, encourage more investment in the subsector.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
