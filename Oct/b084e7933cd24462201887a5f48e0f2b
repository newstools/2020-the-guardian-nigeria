 [FILE PHOTO] The re-elected President of the Nigerian Labour Congress, Ayuba Wabba PHOTO: NAN  The core issues for which the Labour Unions had threatened a strike action are largely twofold – the unwholesome increase in the price of petroleum products and the hike in tariff for electricity across the country. The confusion that followed the increase in the price of premium motor spirit at N162 a litre triggered the crisis. This increase in the price of premium motor spirit happened in a week the Federal Government also approved a 300 per cent hike in electricity bills. It can be recalled that the atmosphere before the calling off of the strike was tense and that this created multiplier effects on the social and economic life of the nation. Many had already stockpiled food and other essential items hoping for the worst when eventually, the strike never took place with the aggrieved masses withdrawing back to their shelves hoping that the raging issues would be eventually resolved one way or the other. Indeed, Nigerians are very hopeful and resilient people. The point at issue is how the government and the unions can meaningfully navigate through the post-strike period. Any mismanagement of this period has the potential of leading to the resurgence of the crisis, albeit in a more dangerous dimension.
 
The battle for the design of appropriate pricing of petroleum products in Nigeria has been long drawn. Many have opined that unless this issue is addressed, there would not be any meaningful progress in the efficient delivery of these products to the Nigerian public. These issues have wide-ranging implications for the standard of living of the people. The issues include smuggling of products to the neighbouring countries and functioning of the local refineries and the efficient operations of the downstream sector of the oil and gas industry in Nigeria.
