The Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Godswill Akpabio, has warned of imminent flood disaster in the Niger Delta. Akpabio issued the warning at the official presentation of the Inter-Agency Committee’s report on the assessment of potential impact of flooding and level of preparedness in the region for 2020 seasonal rainfall in Abuja, yesterday. According to him, flooding has claimed lives and destroyed property despite sensitisation, early warning and awareness creation. However, the Akwa Ibom state governor stated that the ministry would implement recommendations of the committee towards preventing the disaster. He said the report would be forwarded to the Federal Executive Council (FEC), as well as the governors, councils and International Oil Companies (IOCs) in the region. According to him, “Over the years, the Niger Delta region has witnessed varying degrees of environmental challenges that have had tremendous negative impact on not only the people of the region, but also of the nation as a whole. “One of these environmental challenges that has assumed annual occurrence is the seasonal flooding of the area with its catastrophic consequences, hence the inauguration of the Inter-Agency Committee.” The minister commended the committee for the report. The Permanent Secretary of the ministry, Dr. Babayo Ardo, stated that following the persistent flooding in the region resulting to loss of lives and property, the ministry set up the committee to look into the near and remote causes of flooding in the Niger Delta, assess its impact and proffer recommendations that would mitigate the impact of flooding in the region.
