The campaigners, yesterday, engaged men of the Nigeria Police Force on the busy Benin-Ugbowo-Lagos highway amid the existing curfew in Edo State. The youths came out, as usual, to mount roadblocks in solidarity with the EndSARS protest at the location that houses both the Federal Government Girls College (FGGC) and the University of Benin (UNIBEN) main campus, but were resisted by the police. The development resulted in the friction where gunfires were exchanged. Efforts to reach the Police Public Relations Officer in the state, DSP Chidi Nwabuzor, for comments were unsuccessful. MEANWHILE, the demonstrators apprehended some hoodlums who robbed unsuspecting members of the public and broke into shops, disguising as EndSARS campaigners. At the University of Benin Teaching Hospital (UBTH) and UNIBEN main gate, the protesters nabbed four persons who broke into shops within the vicinity and were about carting away goods worth millions of naira. They eventually took the four-man gang that specialised in burglary, to the Ugbowo police station for proper investigation, but were shocked by their rejection. The amazed marchers were told by the force that they were not permitted since Mondayâ€™s violence in the state, to arrest or detain any suspect in their cells. The police division advised the protesters to take the suspects and the stolen items to the headquarters. An officer, who pleaded anonymity, said the reason was not unconnected with the burning down of two police stations on Monday.
