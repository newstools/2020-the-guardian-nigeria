UI suspends process of appointing VC over protest
Oyo State Commissioner of Police (CP), Nwachukwu Enwonwu, yesterday, said that six police officers were killed while five police stations were burnt by hoodlums during the violence that trailed the #EndSARS protests in the state. Enwonwu, who disclosed this at a press briefing while parading the suspects at the Eleiyele Police Headquarters, said that nine suspects were arrested in connection with arson and looting in Iseyin, Iseyin Local Council of the state. The CP, who berated the killing of policemen, lamented that some of them were roasted like goats for committing no offence against their attackers. Enwonwu said the police were on the trail of those who looted, killed and committed arson in the state, emphasising that the long hands of the law would soon catch up with them. Meanwhile, one of the suspected burglars of Iseyin Police Station, Farouk Toheeb, confessed that he took two cartons of beer and a generating set at the station during the crisis. The suspect said the two cartons of beer were shared among the protesters during the struggle, but the generating set was returned after the youths leader in the town announced that all looted property should be returned. He, however, denied being among the people that set the station ablaze. In another development, after hours of protest by non-academic staff unions of the University of Ibadan (UI), Oyo State, against the process of appointing the next Vice Chancellor of the institution, Chairman of the University Council, Dr. Joshua Waklek, yesterday, announced the suspension of the process. Waklek also promised to meet with the protesting members of staff tomorrow to critically look into their demands. Nonetheless, he said it would be the decision of the entire council to decide on eliminating one of the candidates as requested by the non-teaching members of staff.
