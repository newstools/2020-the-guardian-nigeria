â€¢ Employ 1,996 Nigerians, 59 expatriates Service providers, including Internet service providers (ISPs), and fixed wired players generated N18.6 billion more in 2019 than their 2018 collective earnings. Specifically, the players, excluding GSM operators, generated N449.1 billion in 2019 against N430.5 billion earned a year before. The 2019 Subscriber/Network Data report by the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), showed that the service providers, however, spent N42.4 billion more in 2019 in operating cost. As at December 2019, the operating cost incurred was put at N319.9 billion against N277.5 billion spent a year before, which was an increase of 15.2 per cent. NCC said the increase in incurred expenses may be a consequence of the exchange rate effects in the industry. According to the report, notable service providers, such as Galaxy Backbone Limited, generated N7.1 billion in 2019, and spent N3.78 billion as operating cost. Interconnect Clearing House Limited earned N746.9 million, with N637 million deployed in operating cost in the period under review.
