Former Governor of Imo State, Rochas Okorocha, has said the call for Igbo presidency is more of competition with other regions that have produced presidents. He said that the nation needs a president that can unite every part of the country. Rochas, who was invited to Bauchi State by Sheik Dhairu Usman Bauchi, to celebrate his yearly Mauloud, yesterday, was also given an award for being ambassador of the poor. While speaking with the media, Okorocha said: “We should be talking about a Nigerian president that will make education affordable, a Nigerian president that alleviates poverty and ensures that everyone has something to eat irrespective of where you come from. “We need a Nigerian President that can unite this country irrespective of his tribe or religion. That is what we should be talking about, more importantly. But the issue of Nigerian president of Igbo extraction, for me, is more of a competition, so to say. That the north has produced a president, the Southwest has produced a president and South-South has produced and let us see what Nigeria will look like when we have Igbo presidency. “That is not the main issue, if you have a president yet, people are hungry… Presidency is not just a title but to doing the job.” The senator also commended President, Muhammadu Buhari for his fight against corruption. He said that fighting corruption is like democracy. “Fighting corruption should be a fight of the people, for the people and by the people. Also, you educate the people more about it rather than fighting corruption because most people who engage in corrupt practices don’t know the impact they have on society. “They have seen it as a norm but you need to educate them of its implications on the society,” he said.
