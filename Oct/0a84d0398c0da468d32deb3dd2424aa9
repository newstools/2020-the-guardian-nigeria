especially as many states are declaring curfew. In a statement in Abuja, president of the association, Dr Uyilawa Okhuaihesuyi, expressed concern over the unrest in the country and called on President Muhammadu

We demand that the military be removed from our streets and the police be refrained from shooting at unarmed citizens; rather they should protect the innocent citizens who have the constitutional right to protest. “We categorically state that we stand with other Nigerians on the #EndSARS campaign.
