Expected to give the keynote address at the conference is the Minister of Science and Technology, Ogbonnaya Onu. Scholars, policy makers and medical fields would be at the conference to discuss research activities that could engender development through the multidisciplinary field of nanotechnology. Lateef stated that for Nigeria to derive maximum benefits from nanotechnology research, government at all levels and stakeholders must increase funding to education sector. The group calls on technocrats, industrialists, funding agencies and government to support its quest for innovative research in nanotechnology for the benefit of the nation and humanity at large.
