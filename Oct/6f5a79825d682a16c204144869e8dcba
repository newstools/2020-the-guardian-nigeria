The lush green course of the Ibori Golf and Country Club (IGCC) will begin from today, host a kitty to celebrate the new handicap of Chike Anyansi, who has risen to handicap 28. According to the organisers of the competition, about 100 players from the Aba Golf Club, Benin Golf Club, Python, and Port Harcourt clubs from Rivers State, among others, will participate on the event. “All arrangements have been made to host golfers on Friday to a cocktail event on arrival, while the kitty will tee off 6:30 a.m. Saturday morning. “Socials and presentation of prizes will hold in the evening to round up the event,” a member of the organizing committee, Queen Mowah noted. Also speaking on the event, its sponsor, Chike Anyansi, said he decided to hold the event to appreciate God for surviving the pandemic, which barred golfers from the course for a while, and to also celebrate his new valid handicap. “The valid Handicap and a new lease of health benefits give me enough reasons to celebrate. I will also have an opportunity to socialise with gentlemen and Ladies golfers from different places and backgrounds. “I chose golf because of its great benefits but apart from that, golf brings together friends, family, employees, and potential clients and business partners.” Joining a golf club means you will meet people with similar interests as you. You are also more likely to meet some influential people, considering that many top CEOs play golf,” Anyansi said.
