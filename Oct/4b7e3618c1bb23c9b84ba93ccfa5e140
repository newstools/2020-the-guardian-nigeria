Dr. Kenechukwu made this known while speaking with newsmen on the recent #EndSars protest and why the youths must change the narratives. In his words, “If we can occupy 80 per cent of National Assembly. Then we can find it easy to change different parts of the constitution that holds the country down. This can happen when every single young person puts their interest in the business of nation building.” “Come 2023, Nigerian youths should elect only young people that are worthy of representing them. And this would enable the country to be able to get the needed change that the
#ENDSARS movement are yearning for.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
