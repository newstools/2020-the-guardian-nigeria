The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) has revealed that either Delta or Edo State will host next month’s African Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifier between Nigeria and Sierra Leone. NFF Deputy Media Director, Ademola Olajire, told The Guardian that the federation is still discussing with the two states’ governments, adding that the venue will be announced in due course. The Super Eagles were scheduled to host Sierra Leone earlier this year, but the Confederation of African Football (CAF) suspended the AFCON qualifiers following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of preparations for the qualifiers, the Super Eagles played two friendly matches against Algeria and Tunisia in Austria on Friday and Tuesday. Meanwhile, Delta State government has revealed that it will make its stance on the hosting bid public next week. The chairman of the state’s Sports Commission, Tony Okowa, told The Guardian that his commission will meet with the Delta State Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa, to arrange modalities for hosting the qualifier.
