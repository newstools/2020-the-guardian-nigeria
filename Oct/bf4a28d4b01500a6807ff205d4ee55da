Following the disbandment of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS), lawyers have charged the Inspector General of Police (IGP) to ensure officers fingered in the killing of innocent people are brought to book.
 
A lawyer to the family of Isiaq Jimoh, who was allegedly killed by policemen in Ogbomoso, Oyo State, during the #EndSARS protest, has given a seven-day ultimatum for investigation, and threatened to institute a legal action against the police.
 
Hussein Afolabi, in a letter dated October 12, 2020, has asked IGP Mohammed Adamu to investigate the murder of Jimoh. Afolabi said the deceased was not part of the protest, but was hit by a bullet when the officers fired bullets to disperse unarmed protesters.
