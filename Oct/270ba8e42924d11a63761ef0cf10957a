Barely 24 hours after experiencing its highest climb in many months to N15 trillion mark on Tuesday, renewed profit-taking by investors at the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), made the bears regain control on equity transactions, thereby reversing the 14 days of consecutive bull runs as market capitalisation shed N143 billion.
 
Yesterday, the All Share Index (ASI), fell by 275.02 points or 0.95 per cent to 28,634.35 points. Accordingly, investors lost N143 billion in value as market capitalisation declined to N14.967 trillion.
 
The downturn was impacted by losses recorded in medium and large capital stocks, including MTN Nigeria Communications (MTNN), Unilever Nigeria, Zenith Bank, Guinness Nigeria, and Lafarge Africa.
   
Analysts attributed the profit-taking activities to investors selling part of their holdings in blue-chip stocks to book profit amid the recent rise in price.  On the other hand, Unilever Nigeria led the losers’ chart by 9.89 per cent to close at N12.30 per share.
 
Cornerstone Insurance followed with a 9.09 per cent fall to close at 60 kobo, while Ecobank Transnational Incorporated slipped 8.89 per cent to close at N4.10, per share.
   
UACN Property Development Company shed 8.14 per cent to close at 79 kobo, and Custodian Investment declined by 7.21 per cent to close at N5.15, per share.
