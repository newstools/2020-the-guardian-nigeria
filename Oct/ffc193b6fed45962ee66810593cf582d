The project coordinator for the partnership between NECA’s Network of Entrepreneurial Women (NNEW) and Action Aid Nigeria, Mrs. Olakintan Wellington, has called on market women to leverage social media to grow their businesses. Wellington gave the charge recently during basic digital marketing training for about 58 representatives of women petty traders in the state. She explained that irrespective of educational background, using the platforms would assist anybody to sell their products and services better.
   
She said during the lockdowns it was discovered that a lot of market women who were the breadwinners of their families could not sell, increasing hunger and tension.
  
The NNEW’s coordinator noted that the new normal is not life, as usual, stressing that with the knowledge of digital platforms, the participant would sell their products across the borders. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
