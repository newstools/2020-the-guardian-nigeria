More Nigerians are reaping the rewards of consumer patronage and brand loyalty as over 200 lucky winners across the country have emerged star prize winners in the ongoing Dangote Cement Bag of Goodies Consumer Promo Season 2.
 
There are, however, still better days ahead for other Nigerians, as about 800 more consumers are expected to win the star prize of N1,000,000 each before the promo ends in November.
 
Despite the season of gloom occasioned by the coronavirus pandemic, 204 lucky consumers had won the star prizes before September 29, and three out of that number had won the N1 million cash prize more than once.
 
This is apart from the thousands of other prizes, some of which include television sets, refrigerators, smaller cash prizes, Dangote Food goodies packs and recharge cards, among others.  She said Dangote Cement values the consumers who are the end users of cement products.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
