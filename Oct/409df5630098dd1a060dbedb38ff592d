Ayade bans movement of scraps
Scarcity of essential perishable food items like vegetables, tomatoes, pepper, onions and others have hit Calabar as traders and consumers in Cross River State count their losses from the curfew declared by the state government.
 
The #EndSARS protest taken a violent turn last weekend, resulting in the massive destruction of lives and property which forced the state government to declare a dusk-to-dusk curfew on Friday night.
 
The situation has caused scarcity of perishable food items, as only a few commodities find their way into the market after the curfew was relaxed from 8:00a.m. to 4:00p.m. on Tuesday. Consumers were forced to buy spoilt items and few good ones at high prices.  MEANWHILE, the aftermath of the #EndSARS protest has also resulted in the meat scarcity in Port Harcourt and other local councils in Rivers State. Checks by The Guardian showed empty shelves on tables of meat sellers in various open markets in the state as well as supermarkets.
 
The prices of the few available ones sighted were hiked, thereby subjecting residents to seek alternatives like fish, which is also costly.
 
It was gathered that trucks that bring cattle into the state had been targets of hoodlums since the unrest that followed the #EndSARS protest in the past one week.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
