Photo; TWITTER/NIGERIAGOV  The clarification followed insinuations that the piece of legislation was to be abandoned until next year for consideration of the 2021 budget presented yesterday by the Nigerian leader. Senate spokesperson, Ajibola Basiru, said his legislative chamber could not have felt less interested considering the importance of the bill to the realisation of a vibrant oil sector premised on transparency and competitiveness. “On October 20, the bill will enter second reading after which it will be sent to the relevant committee of the Senate,” he clarified. Basiru said work would go on simultaneously on the budget and the PIB. Senate President Ahmad Lawan corroborated the image-maker before adjourning plenary yesterday. According to him, the early debate is to avert any delay that might arise from the decision any time to suspend plenary for one month to enable ministries, departments, and agencies (MDAs) to defend their votes. Also, House of Representatives spokesman, Benjamin Kalu, restated that deliberation on the proposed legislation commences next week. Addressing reporters in Abuja, he stated: “There has been news flying around that we are suspending deliberation on the PIB till the first quarter of next year. That is not the position of the legislative arm. We want to look at it.” The Abia lawmaker said the Green Chamber would dedicate Tuesdays and Wednesdays to the 2021 appropriation bill.
