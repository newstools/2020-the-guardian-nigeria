He said: ”I met again with the IGP tonight. Our determination to reform the police should never be in doubt. ”I am being briefed regularly on the reform efforts ongoing to end police brutality and unethical conduct, and ensure that the Police are fully accountable to the people. ”The IG already has my firm instructions to conclusively address the concerns of Nigerians regarding these excesses, & ensure erring personnel are brought to justice. ”I appeal for patience & calm, even as Nigerians freely exercise their right to peacefully make their views known. ”The vast majority of men and women of the Nigeria Police Force are patriotic and committed to protecting the lives and livelihoods of Nigerians, and we will continue to support them to do their job.” The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that some aggrieved individuals have embarked on demonstration against what they described as police brutality in Lagos, Abuja, Delta, Osun and few other cities across Nigeria in recent days.
