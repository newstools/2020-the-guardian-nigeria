Former Anambra State Governor Peter Obi insists only massive investment in education sector will make Nigeria a developed nation. Delivering the 60th Founder’s Day lecture titled: “Nigeria at 60 and the Journey So Far” at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka (UNN), yesterday, he blamed inadequate funding for public education for the country’s poor economy. According to him, education remains the engine room and driver of any economy. Obi regretted that 60 years after independence, succeeding administrations had not focused on education to develop the country. “For Nigeria to compete with developed nations, the country must massively invest in education by allocating adequate funds in the annual budget. The annual budgets for education is low, an indication that the government is not giving education the required attention. We need to make adequate investment in education that will create more employment, increase literacy level and reduce poverty level in the country,” the ex-governor said. Obi, who was the Peoples Democratic Party’s vice presidential candidate for last year’s election, stated that no fewer than 15 million children are currently out of school in the country. “These people who are there in the streets may be the ones to make meaningful contributions that can salvage the country,” he said. Obi said the likes of China, India, United States, Britain and South Africa have good economies because of their massive investment in education. He urged public officials to reduce the cost governance by reducing the number of their aides to ensure infrastructural development and employment. The PDP chief urged the Federal Government to increase its financial assistance to Micro Small Medium Enterprise (MSME) to boost the economy. Obi praised his old school for organising the event.
