There is hope to completely reduce the new infections if we continue to practice and adhere to all preventive and containment measures of COVID-19. We should not relax and relent our efforts. Further, be aware that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly spreads by respiratory droplets released when people talk, cough, or sneeze. It is thought that the virus may also spread to hands from a contaminated surface and then to the nose, mouth or eyes, causing infection. The spread of the virus is faster in overcrowded places. Therefore, it is especially important to take caution when organizing or when attending mass gatherings as the risk of contracting or spreading the disease is high. The more people an individual interacts with at a gathering and the longer that interaction lasts, the higher the potential risk of becoming infected with COVID-19 or spreading the COVID-19 to others. COVID-19 preventive and containment measures should be highly considered for all mass gatherings. These Include frequent handwashing or sanitization, maintaining at least 1 metre apart between individuals, wearing face mask properly and implementing environmental prevention practices such as cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces. For those considering organizing an event the following has to be considered: Watch your distance! Wash your hands! Wear your mask! Stay safe!
