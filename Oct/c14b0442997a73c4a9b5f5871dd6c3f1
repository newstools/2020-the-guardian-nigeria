UEFA said on Thursday it will allow spectators back into matches in the Champions League and its other competitions “at a maximum of 30 percent” of capacity. However, the loosening of restrictions is subject to national authorities giving the green light and UEFA acknowledged that certain games may still go ahead behind closed doors or with even more limited numbers of fans. Away supporters will not be allowed in “until further notice”.
