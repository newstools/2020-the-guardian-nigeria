A statement by the Minister of Youth and Sports Development Media office clarified that consultations were ongoing between the Ministry, the Edo State Government, the PTF on Covid-19, and the National Council on Sports to decide on a new date to host the Festival. “Like we did by consulting with the PTF on Covid-19, when we lifted the ban on non-contact sports and later contact sports, discussions are ongoing to decide on a new date for the Festival. The fake news that the Festival has been postponed indefinitely must have emanated from a false source.” The statement further stated: “We are considering a staggered Festival spanning several weeks and Athletes batched, no fans and strict adherence to the Covid-19 protocol. While we are committed to holding the Festival, we do not want to endanger the lives of athletes and officials. Be rest assured that a decision would be taken in line with the Government’s guidelines in the best interest of the common good of our sports and the athletes.” The National Sports Festival, which was earlier scheduled to hold in March in Benin City, Edo State was postponed due to the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, which also affected social, economic activities worldwide.
