Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday said he met with the Inspector General of Police over the continued extrajudicial activities of the notorious police unit Special Anti-Robbery Squad. “I met again with the IGP tonight. Our determination to reform the police should never be in doubt,” Buhari tweeted. “I am being briefed regularly on the reform efforts ongoing to end police brutality and unethical conduct, and ensure that the Police are fully accountable to the people,” he added. Nigerians in Abuja, Oyo, Lagos, Edo, and some other states across the country have taken to the streets to demand the total disbandment of the SARS police unit. There were more than 2.4 million tweets with #EndSARS on Friday. Several celebrities also expressed support for the movement. The squad has been accused of been notorious and their notoriety has been described as one that defies human comprehension and reeks of outright incompetence, deliberate violations of human rights, extra-judicial killings, and unbridled extortion. Buhari said he ordered the IGP “to conclusively address the concerns of Nigerians regarding these excesses, & ensure erring personnel are brought to justice.” Details later To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
