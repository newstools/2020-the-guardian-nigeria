A telecoms guru, Mr. Adegoke Ayoola, has sued the Inspector-General of Police (IGP) for alleged unlawful arrest and detention in respect of civil and commercial transactions at the federal high court, Abuja. 
   
The claimant through his counsel, Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa (SAN), is claiming that the police was directly aiding and abetting his opponents to take over his company and commercial interests. 
   
Also joined, as defendants in the suit are DSP Funmi Eguaoje, who is the police team leader; SC Connections Ltd; Mr. Ali Joda, Mohammed Bashir Ahmed, among others.
   
Mr. Ayoola in a 58-paragraph affidavit stated that he formed a partnership with some businessmen to handle telecoms interconnections between the telecoms operators, with a profit ratio of 58/42 per cent.  According to him, the petition led to his arrest on September 3, 2020 and his subsequent detention for seven days in Abuja, with other suspects who had no face masks, sanitizers and did not observe any COVID-19 safety protocols.
 
While he was in police custody, the police allegedly forced him to agree to settle with his opponents, who were allowed to take over his interrogation and interview, and all the while dictating to the police and demanding documents from him. At age 61 and with underlying health conditions, Mr. Ayoola stated that he is scared for his health and that the police were deliberately surrendering their powers to his opponents to harass, intimidate and bully him into yielding his interests, investments and years of labour, to them.
