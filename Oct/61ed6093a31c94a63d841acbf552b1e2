A 48-year-old man, Charles Ekwe, has been arrested by officials of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corp (NSCDC) for sexually abusing his wife’s 13-year-old niece. He was arrested by the gender-based unit of the corps on October 12, in Lagos.
 
A statement by the spokesperson for the agency, Bada Kehinde Mary, said the suspect started abusing the 13-year-old before the COVID-19 lockdown and she was scared to report to her aunty.  She then took her for medical examination and it was confirmed that she has been defiled. The suspect admitted to committing the crime but insisted he only fondled her genitals and made her watch pornography on his phone.
 
The Lagos commandant, Mr. Ayeni Paul, said the suspect will face the full wrath of the law and will be handed over to the appropriate agency for further investigation and prosecution. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
