Nigerian Stock Exchange Analysts link market rebound to earnings, low interest rate
The ongoing civil unrest across the country weighed on investors’ sentiment, as activity levels remained weak with the value of trade falling 14.4% week-on-week (w/w). The Mid-week sell-offs resulted in the market recording its biggest loss since October 7th, as the ASI declined by 0.8.
Surprisingly, bargain-hunting in the last two trading sessions of the week (Thur: +0.4%; Fri: +0.5%) completely wiped off the week’s losses and pushed the market into the green. Consequently, the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) All-share index and market capitalisation both appreciated by 0.13% to close the week at 28,697.06, and N14.999 trillion, respectively. However, all other indices finished lower with the exception of NSE-Main Board, NSE 30, NSE MERI Growth, and NSE Consumer Goods, which appreciated by 0.79 per cent, 0.14 per cent, 0.68 per cent, and 2.86 per cent, while the NSE ASeM Index closed flat. Analysts linked the rebound to earnings expectations, as more companies are yet to release their numbers to enable investors and traders ascertain their status of each company and earnings power that will support full-year dividend pay-out. The market has, so far, reacted positively to the few numbers that beat expectation and forecast. In addition, they said the low interest rate regime and yields in the fixed income market has continued to support the equity price rally. Analysts at Codros Capital said: “Despite the heat in the socio-political landscape triggered by the degeneration of the #ENDSARS protests, we do not expect a material dent to investors’ appetite for stocks. “We reiterate that pent up system liquidity and the hunt for alpha-yielding opportunities in the face of increasingly negative real returns in the fixed income market remain positive for stocks. However, we advise investors to trade in only fundamentally justified stocks as the weak macro environment remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings.” Further analysis of last week’s transactions showed that a turnover of 1.505 billion shares worth N19.668 billion was recorded in 20,552 deals week by investors on the floor of the Exchange.
