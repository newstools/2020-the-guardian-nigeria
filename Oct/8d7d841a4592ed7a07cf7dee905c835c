Reactions As Man Sues Jack Dorsey Over His Support For #EndSARS Protests On Tuesday, a businessman, Adamu Garba, took to social media to post a video of him where he stated he has instituted a $1 billion suit against the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Founder of Twitter International Company, Jack Dorsey. This he did at the Federal High Court, Abuja, over alleged sponsorship of the ongoing #EndSARS Protest across the country. This comes after a series of tweets addressed to Jack, criticising him on his support for youths over their demand that the federal government should end police brutality. This act by Garba has led to different reactions on social media, most questioning his decisions and others requesting Twitter to pull down his account. Below are some: The Nigerian government is waging war on us on ALL fronts. Adamu Garba is in court asking Jack for 1 billion USD. Governors are imposing curfews. Thugs are getting paid to disrupt protests. All because we asked our own government to stop killing us #EndSARS — King Koko (@korie_tweets) October 20, 2020  The rules of my profession preclude me from making disparaging remarks about my colleagues but I find it curious that someone appended his signature and seal to this process.
