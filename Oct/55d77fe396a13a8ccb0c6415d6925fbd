The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)  on Saturday won the  Bauchi State council poll, clearing all 20 local government areas. Governor Bala Mohammed, who swore in the newly elected council bosses on Sunday, urged them to focus on development of the grassroots. Until Saturday, Bauchi had no elected council chairmen in the last 12 years.
The governor, who said their tenure,  is two years,  stressed that how far they would go in politics was dependent on their performances. He urged the new chairmen to manage the resources at their disposal to make life meaningful for rural dwellers. “It is historic because an election of the type we have just witnessed was last conducted in the state some 12 years ago,” Mohammed said. “I expect you to be very vigilant in the area of security and assist in reporting any act that is likely to cause security breach.” The governor,  who also sworn in the newly appointed acting Head of Civil Service, Alhaji Aliyu Jibo, told  him to assist the state government in repositioning the civil service for efficiency and productivity. The new  Chairman of Alkaleri Local Government Area, Alhaji Yusuf Garba,  who spoke on behalf of his colleagues, declared their readiness to defend democracy.
