He urged Senators to ensure they wear their face masks pointing out that “We also have to wear our face masks mandatorily. We are going to also abridge the entire event because we will be many there.” On the duration of the Budget presentation session, the Senate President said: “So the entire event will last for just about an hour. From the entry of the President into the chamber and addresses and the presentation and laying will be just an hour event” “This is done so that we would be able to comply with the requirements of the COvID-19 protocol. “Mr. President this time around will not be accompanied by many people on the entourage. “Only a few people – very key and relevant to the budget – will accompany Mr. President into the chamber.” He stressed. ” I think by the arrangement those of them that have little to do with the budget will join virtually what will happen,” Lawan explained.
