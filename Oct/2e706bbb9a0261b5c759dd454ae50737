Conference of Nigeria Political Parties (CNPP) has said that President Muhammadu Buhari’s nationwide broadcast on Thursday, October 22, 2020 was belated. In a reaction to the broadcast, the conference said it did not show sign of commitment to the plight of Nigerians and the nation in general. The CNPP, in a statement signed by its Secretary General, Chief Willy Ezugwu, said if the President had made the broadcast earlier, the carnage would have been averted. According to the CNPP, “we warned ahead of the carnage but the government never listened,” wondering why President Buhari did not address the open shooting by soldiers on protesting youths at the Lekki tollgate. “While we continue to condemn acts of violence under whatever circumstances, what is the use of the charmer after the snake had bitten?” The statement said, “right now, Nigerians are tied of propaganda and mere promises. We, therefore, urge President Muhammadu Buhari to ensure justice is done, by punishing, adequately, all SARS officers who extra-judicially killed citizens in the past and match words with actions by immediately reforming the Nigeria Police Force. “The government must ensure that there is no cover up in investigation of the Lekki shooting and other investigation by the state governments. This is the only way to assuaged the protesting youths.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
