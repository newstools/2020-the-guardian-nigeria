The Ministry of Youth and Sports Development has disclosed that the 2020 Edo National Sports Festival suspended by the Federal Government due to the COVID-19 pandemic may still hold this year as a staggered event, after the lifting of ban on contact sports last week by the Presidential Task Force on Covid-19. Speaking with The Guardian, the Special Adviser on Media to the Sports Minister, John Joshua Akanji, noted that the ministry was currently discussing with relevant agencies on planned modalities that would make the event hold this year. He said that the ministry was also working hard to get the nod for the event to hold, and also, put in mind, precautionary measures to protect participating athletes. He added that the sports minister would continue to do his best to lifting the standard of sports in the country. “Yes the festival may hold as a staggered event with minimal fans under adherence to COVID-19 guidelines. Discussions on a new date is ongoing among the sports ministry, PTF on COVID-19, Edo State and National Council on Sports,” he said.
