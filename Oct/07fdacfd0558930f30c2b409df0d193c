The Minister of State for Budget and National Planning, Mr. Clement Agba, has disclosed that Nigeria got a $26.942 billion development assistance fund from international donors between 2015 and 2020. The minister spoke when he appeared before the House of Representatives Committee on Civil Society and Development Partners on Donor Funds Receipts, Transfers and Disbursement to Government Agencies, Civil Society and Non-Governmental Organisations in Nigeria.
The breakdown, he explained are: $2.339 billion (2015)), $1.150 billion (2016), $774.933 million (2017), $22.016 billion (2018), $655.642 million (2019) and $5.639 million 2020. He further explained that the donations come from the European Development Fund (EDF), the United Nations Development Systems (UNDS), China through the Bilateral Agreement between the government of Nigeria and the People’s Republic of China signed in 1972 and Japan activities in Nigeria via the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). The other donors, he said, were Korean International Cooperation Agency (KOICA), Department for International Development (DFID), the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the German International Cooperation (GIZ). He disclosed that Nigeria was not qualified for budget support in view of the fact that it is not classified as a lower-income country.
He: “The implication of this is that donors do not give us the funds for management, rather they work with the sectoral stakeholders to fund the projects directly after identifying the needs by ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs) and states in line with the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. “ To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
