Sections of the road have not been graded for long let alone tarred. Added to that are the several craters that dot the road. Yet, the Mile 2-Badagry-Seme road is Nigeria’s gateway to the West African coast. Driving on it at any time of the day takes special driving skills. At night, it is a nightmare for motorists.  MEANWHILE, as youths in the country continue with their widespread #EndSARS protests, youths in the area have called for the redeployment of the Divisional Police Officer of encouraging police extortion. They have, therefore, said they would not leave the streets until all the checkpoints are dismantled in the axis.
 
According to a media and political activist, Ovi Manuel Kuponu, the DPO of Badagry division allegedly deploys policemen under his watch to extort money from motorists, thereby causing diplomatic embarrassment to Nigerians on the international highway and inflicting more pains on residents enduring the dilapidated road.
 
“Also, the DPO, Peter Gbesu, personally led policemen to disrupt, brutalise and arrest three of the #FixLagosBadagryExpressRoad protesters who embarked on a peaceful procession from Mowo Junction to Aradagun Bus Stop.”
 
But reacting to the allegations, the spokesman of the Lagos Police Command, Muyiwa Adejobi, simply said: “It is not true. Please ignore the rumours.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
