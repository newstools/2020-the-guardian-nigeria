• Take Umar’s warning seriously, groups tell FG The Southern and Middle Belt Leaders Forum (SMBLF) has charged President Muhammadu Buhari to confirm the National Judicial Council’s (NJC) nominee as substantive President of the Court of Appeal without going through another acting term. In statement issued yesterday, Spokesmen of the forum, Yinka Odumakin (South West), Guy Ikokwu (South East), Bassey Henshaw (South-South) and Dr. Isuwa Dogo (Middle Belt) said the group made the demand having read former Kaduna State military administrator, Col Abubakar Umar (rtd’s) open letter to President. “We are constrained to call on President Buhari to immediately confirm NJC nominee as the substantive President of the Court of Appeal without going through another acting term. “In this particular instance, it would manifest that the government is out to achieve some unfortunate goal if any attempt is made to jump to the next line,” the statement added. In a similar vein, the Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria (HURIWA) has urged the President to listen to the voice of God through Umar in which he asked the President to be for all Nigerians, especially in his appointments. HURIWA stated that the major crisis of mutual distrust, which weighs heavily against national harmony, was as a result of cumulative angst generated by the present administration’s consistent marginalisation of most segments of the society, especially in the allocation of resources and appointments. Its National Coordinator, Emmanuel Onwubiko and National Media Affairs Director, Zainab Yusuf, said President Buhari needed to amend his leadership style in line with the sound and qualitative counseling that Umar had offered on a platter of gold. Meanwhile, Campaign for Equity cautioned President Buhari against treating former military governor of Kaduna State, Col. Abubakar Umar (rtd’s) recent warning in which he asserted that the president’s “lopsided appointments” would ruin Nigeria with levity. Its National Coordinator, Oliver Akosa, stated that Umar’s position lent credence to the group’s campaign against the present administration’s Northern-bent appointments. Umar’s declaration was in line with the group’s earlier position, which drew attention to the constitution of the Board of Trustees (BoT) of the Police Trust Fund (PTF), an important security agency in the country, he said.
