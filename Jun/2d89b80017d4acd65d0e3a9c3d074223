Ahead of the October 10, 2020 governorship election in Ondo State, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has declared that the party will not adopt any zoning arrangement. National Chairman of the party, Uche Secondus, disclosed this in Abuja when one of the party’s top aspirants in the state, Eyitayo Jegede (SAN), visited the national secretariat to obtain his Expression of Interest Form. Secondus, who was represented by the Deputy National Chairman (South), Yemi Akinwonmi, said: “It is not our responsibility here to talk about zoning. “It is our responsibility to conduct integrity-based primary and give a level playing ground to all the aspirants.” On his part, Jegede said that all the aspirants were working to ensure that PDP emerges victorious in the forthcoming governorship poll. He noted that the opposition party was ready to wrestle power from the incumbent APC-led government in Ondo State. “The forthcoming governorship election is the project of all the residents of the state, not an individual project,” he said.
