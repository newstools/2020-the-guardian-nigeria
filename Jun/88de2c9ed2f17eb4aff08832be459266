Former senator representing Lagos Central Senatorial District at the Nigerian Senate, Muniru Muse, has died. A family source said Muse died at Ahmadiyya Hospital in Apapa on Tuesday morning. “I just lost a very caring and kind-hearted father, Senator Munirudeen Adekunle Muse,” his son, Sulaimon Muse, said on Tuesday. “I saw you last, right inside the Lagos Central Mosque.” I never knew that was the last time I would set my eyes on you alive.” Muse, a former Apapa Port Manager and former Chairman of Apapa Local Government, was succeeded in the Senate by the former First Lady of Lagos State Oluremi Tinubu.
