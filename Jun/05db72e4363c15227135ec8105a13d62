The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) and the Trade Union Congress of Nigeria have disagreed over the proposed June 29 strike action called by the former. The NLC Chairman, Comrade Benedict Ukpekpi had, in a bulletin, called out the workers on strike for June 29 after the expiration of the ultimatum given to government. The TUC said they are not participating in the strike, which Labour is accusing the state of not paying the agreed minimum wage, promotion, arrears and other issues. Briefing newsmen in their secretariat yesterday, the leadership of TUC in the state represented by the Vice-chairman, Comrade Gabriel Effiong and Secretary, Ken Bassey, said that, even though, all the points and issues raised by the NLC are of concern but “the times we are globally is also of huge concern to all.” They said this is not the time to embark on strike because the Coronavirus pandemic has affected nations’ economy, including Nigeria and Cross River State in particular. “We would rather continue negotiation with the state government on those issues. The TUC position against the strike called by the NLC is not to please the government, rather, taken out of conviction and as a matter of principles as the NLC leadership in the state did not build consensus among stakeholders before issuing the 14 days Ultimatum it gave to the state government,” they said.
