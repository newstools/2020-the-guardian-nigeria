Wretch 32 and his father, Millard Scott | Image: YouTube British rapper Wretch 32 has shared a video of his father being tasered at his home by the police. Wretch 32, whose birth name is Jermaine Scott Sinclair, posted a video on Twitter of his father Millard Scott stumbling down the stairs after being tasered by officers in north London, in April.  Mr Scott, 62, in an interview with ITV said he believed he would not have been tasered if he were white. However, the Met Police said a review had found “no indication of misconduct”.
A spokesman for the force said officers went to the property as part of “a long-running operation to tackle drugs supply linked to serious violence”. The Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has called for an urgent investigation by the police watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC). Describing the incident as “distressing”, Mr Khan said: “It is absolutely vital that our police service retains the trust of the communities it serves.” Wretch 32 told ITV that there has been “no progression” since he grew up watching his father and uncle “fight against police brutality”. This comes amid global protests against racism, inequality and police brutality, following the death of George Floyd, 46, in Minneapolis, in the US, after a white police officer was filmed kneeling on his neck. Last month, in his reaction to the video of Derek Chauvin kneeling on Floyd’s neck, Wretch 32 said: “This isn’t a film it’s reality. Have some compassion & accept that Some people are using their badge to transform into animals. The thing is most time they will get away with it as the law is above the law. However, you see God!!!”
