•  Drops Visuals For Nakupenda As a sequel to the release of his debut album, Afro RnB singer, Chike, has released a mixtape of remixes to his debut album, Boo of the Booless. The six-track playlist, which is dubbed Dance of the Booless Volume 1, is a hybrid of Electronic Dance Music (EDM) and experimental Afro-Pop/RnB. Chike deliberately stretches his vocal dexterity along these unfamiliar melodic terrains; he switches the original melancholic vibe of the album to an upbeat and danceable experience.
  
Created by industry professionals Sarmy Fire (Insecure Remix), Sigag Lauren (Nakupenda Remix), Sensei Lo (Insecure Remix Version 2), Dyslex (If You No Love Remix) and Lord Sky (Roju Remix), the entire playlist retains the original love-themed lyrics of the album, which generally expresses multiple perspectives on love and relationships.
  
More experimental playlists are also expected from the former Airtel’s The Voice and Project Fame runner-up, respectively, as this playlist remixes only a third of the original songs on the album.
  
Meanwhile, Chike recently released visuals for the album’s hit single, Nakupenda (featuring Ric Hassani). The video, which is gradually gaining attention, expresses a love story in colourful aesthetics and a dramatic storyline.
  
Directed by Ani James and Aje Film Works, the visual storyline showcases Chike as a rich client, who duels a photographer for the love of a female model. The visual imagery and interpretation from the Anambra-born singer, who also has significant experience in acting, combine to propel the video as a finesse-laden art piece.
