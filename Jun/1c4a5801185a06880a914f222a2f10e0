Beyonce | Image: Variety Beyonce has teased a new visual album “Black Is King”. Beyonce on Saturday teased her fans with a one-minute trailer for the Lion King-inspired visual album, which is also being described as a film, on her website. “Black Is King” will premiere globally through Disney Plus on July 31. It was written, directed and executive produced by Beyonce. The debut arrives approximately one year after the theatrical release of the Lion King remake, which featured Beyonce as the voice for Nala. The film is based on the music of The Lion King: The Gift, which Disney released along with The Lion King film last year. The album features Childish Gambino, Kendrick Lamar, Pharrell, 070 Shake, Tierra Whack, Jay-Z, Blue Ivy Carter and Jessie Reyez, as well as African artists including Wizkid, Shatta Wale, Burna Boy, Mr Eazi, Tiwa Savage, Tekno, Yemi Alade, Busiswa and Salatiel. The upcoming film, which has been in production for a year, aims to reimagine lessons from The Lion King for “today’s young kings and queens in search of their own crowns,” according to an announcement from Disney and Beyoncé’s Parkwood Entertainment. The visual album will highlight “the voyages of Black families, throughout time” and tell the story of “a young king’s transcendent journey through betrayal, love and self-identity,” the release added. “Black Is King is an affirmation of a grand purpose, with lush visuals that celebrate Black resilience and culture.” Black Is King will star Beyonce and feature appearances by other artists who contributed to The Lion King: The Gift.
