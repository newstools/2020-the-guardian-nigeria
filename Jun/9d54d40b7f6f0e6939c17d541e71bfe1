Understanding the root cause of your chid’s bad behaviour helps understand the situation better and how to handle it. Meet Negativity With Positivity What better way to combat negativity than to handle it with positivity. More often than not, children show negative behaviour as a way of getting attention especially when they are in a bad mood. If your child is being negative about everything, stay calm and polite as against snapping or yelling at him. If your child realises that he is not getting a rise out of you, he will soon get tired of it and may become positive. Ignore Instead of getting upset for every time your child displays bad behaviour, learn to ignore and let go. Trying to forcefully change a negative child can backfire as the child may become even more negative as a way of resistance. You can choose to ignore the negative instead. Teach them to Manage their Emotions
Children who do not know how to handle rejection or negative situations that arise will learn to react very badly to it. You can teach them how to handle their emotions by encouraging them to partake in their favourite hobby as a way of calming down. Promote Optimistic Thinking Help your child have an optimistic approach towards life versus a pessimistic one. When your child is an optimist, he finds it easier to find the positive in unfortunate circumstances.  With an optimistic mindset, it becomes hard to stay negative or dwell on the bad. Be Consistent
Freeing your child from negative thinking can be quite a challenge, but remaining consistent is the key. Children are less likely to act out if they have a consistent routine as knowing what to expect will give them a certain amount of security and make them less prone to acting out due to insecurity.
