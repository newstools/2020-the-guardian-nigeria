The coronavirus crisis is a new threat in the Amazon where a surge in deforestation under far-right President Jair Bolsonaro already threatens isolated tribes.

Floyd, 46, an unarmed African-American man, suffocated as a white police officer kneeled on his neck, sparking once-in-a-generation demonstrations against systemic racism and police brutality. The pope said he was praying for Floyd and “all those others who have lost their lives as a result of the sin of racism”. Protests have been held in cities across the country, mostly peaceful but many descending into mayhem. Both activists and officials have blamed rabble-rousers for the trouble and thousands of people have been arrested.
