As Nigeria continues to record a spike in the number of confirmed cases of the dreaded coronavirus, Lagos residents have been urged to take their personal safety seriously and reduce their exposure to COVID-19 by adhering to the safety protocols released by the government. This was made known by members of the Rotaract District 9110 during a presentation of COVID-19 intervention materials to Lagos Island Maternity Hospital at the weekend, in partnership with Revolution Plus Property. Rotaract is a member of Rotary International, a voluntary humanitarian organisation for young persons and undergraduates. The Rotaractors, led by the District Rotaract Representative, Constance Fifekemi Jaiyeola, donated items, including an automatic hand washing machine, nose masks, hand sanitisers, non-contact infrared thermometers, pulse oximeter, surgical gloves, and surgical facemasks to the medical facility.
Jaiyeola said: “There appears to be pandemic fatigue after months of lockdown and low-scale activities, but the daily figures of confirmed cases are a reality check that the community spread of coronavirus is not only real but is still very much with us, and we should not relax in protecting ourselves from contracting the virus.”A member of Revolution Plus Property said they are enthusiastic in joining hands with Rotaractors to help flatten the curve of the pandemic in Lagos.
