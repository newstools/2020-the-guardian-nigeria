In recognition of the huge role the telecommunication sector is playing especially during this coronavirus pandemic, players and other stakeholders in the industry have rallied the Federal Government for support, post-COVID-19.
  
According to the telcos, government’s support has become critical if the industry must sustain the efforts of ensuring that remote and virtual services remain, prices become more affordable and infrastructure becomes more ubiquitous, as the economy shrugs off the pains of the pandemic.
   
Gathered virtually, yesterday, under the auspices of the Association of Telecommunications Companies of Nigeria (ATCON), to discuss: “The Socio-Economic And Political Impact of COVID-19 on Telecom and ICT Sector in Nigeria,” the operators also urged the government to ensure right policy, protection for telecommunications infrastructure, access to funding for players.  The Country Manager, Avanti, Jane Egerton-Idehen, made case for faster implementation of the New National Broadband Plan 2020 to 2025. She stressed the need for collaboration, especially between the sector and states governments that will further see to reduction of Right of Ways, as “COVID-19 has further stretched the some of the timing for some aspect of the plan to be realised.”
