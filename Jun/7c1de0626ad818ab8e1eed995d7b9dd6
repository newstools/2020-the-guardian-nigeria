Renee Gracie Image Twitter Supercars driver Renee Gracie says she has no regrets over giving up the sport to selling X-rated content on adult site OnlyFans. The 25-year-old was active in her racing career between 2012-2017, taking part in competitions such as the Porsche Carerra Cup and the Dunlop Series. She was the first full-time female Supercars racer ever and teamed up with Swiss racer Simona de Silverstro at Bathurst 1000 in 2015. She has not participated in a race since 2017 and is now said to earn around £14,000-a-week through her work on OnlyFans, which ranges from nude photos to videos of her having sex. According to The Mirror, Gracie insisted she was happy with her new career, she says the new career-path has given her so much money than she ever imagined. She further said she has no care for what anyone might call her. When asked about what made her go for porn, she said: I got over it and realised I wasn’t good enough and moved on. I was then selling cars at a car yard, and a couple of fans suggested I do OnlyFans and it started from there. Believe it or not my Dad knows about it and supports it.
 I think you could say my Dad is actually proud because of the financial position I am in and what I have been able to do with the site. You look at what I have achieved not what I am doing, it has been a success. I pretty much do everything. I do whatever it is people request. I sell those photos and people tip me. I have been able to pay for a house. I have a 30-year loan that I am about to pay off in 12 months. Meanwhile, Supercars have distanced themselves from the 25-year-old saying they cannot comment on someone who is no longer part of their organisation.
