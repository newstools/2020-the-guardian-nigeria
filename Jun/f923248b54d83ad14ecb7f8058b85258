D.L. Hughley Image Stewart Cook/Shutterstock D.L. Hughley has tested positive for coronavirus after collapsing on stage during a live comedy set. The 57-year-old comedian and actor was in the middle of his comedy routine in front of an audience in Nashville, Tennessee when he fell to the ground on Friday night. After his speech became slurred and he dropped to the floor, an ambulance was rushed to the Zanies Comedy Club. He was hospitalized and was diagnosed with extreme exhaustion and dehydration. However, after doctors decided to run further tests for his safety, D.L. tested positive for COVID-19. Taking to Twitter to thank his loyal fans for their good wishes and prayers, the comedian admitted that he was beyond shocked to learn that he had contracted the virus. In a short video, he said: Thank you for your prayers and your well wishes. I was scared to death. When I came into the hospital I was being treated for extreme exhaustion and extreme dehydration. But after they ran a battery of tests, it turns out I tested positive for COVID-19 – which blew me away. I was what they call asymptomatic. I didn’t have any symptoms, the classic symptoms. The comedian’s set took place on Juneteeth and was part of a virtual fundraiser dubbed the “Juneteenth Social Awareness-Thon”. The event was to promote black empowerment and education while also raising money to help fight the coronavirus pandemic.
