• Says over 170 countries will be affected
• About $100 billion left emerging markets, developing countries
• Debt, deficits, unemployment, poverty levels to rise further
• Only 50% of African businesses, citizens have access to the Internet With the recent global economic crisis caused by the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned that 90 per cent of the world will be worse off with lower per capita income by year-end.
 
The latest projection is a reversal of IMF’s forecast in January, which predicted that about 160 countries would finish the year with larger economies, and positive per capita income growth.  Speaking at the ‘Great Lockdown to Great Transformation’ event organised by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Georgieva said an important lesson could be drawn from the fact that countries, which have built buffers and sound macroeconomic policies have weathered the crisis much better than those who have not.
 
She said: “Unfortunately, for countries in debt distress, affected by fragility and conflict or with bad underlying conditions, the crisis is terrible. The same way people with weaker immune systems are more at risk from the coronavirus, so weaker economies is at more risk from the economic shock.  On the risk side, Georgieva said the world would emerge from the current crisis with more debt, higher deficits, and in all likelihood a higher structural unemployment, and poverty levels.  “Currently, only 50 per cent of African businesses and citizens have access to the Internet. If this doesn’t change, we will miss a big opportunity and deepen inequality within countries and across countries, including in the United States.”
 
She maintained that there is a huge opportunity in going green; noting that a green economy would offer more employment opportunities, as low carbon energy and infrastructure is a big booster for jobs.
 
She said the IMF was interested in providing incentives for countries and companies to move faster in the direction of adopting a green economy, including by being clear around the risks to businesses during the transition to a low carbon economy.
