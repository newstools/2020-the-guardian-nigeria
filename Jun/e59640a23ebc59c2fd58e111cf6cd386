A Federal High Court in Kano has indicted four police officers for subjecting one AbdulKadir Nasiru to untold torture that led to his death in their custody, ordering them to pay the family a sum of N35 million. The court ordered the Nigerian Police Force to pay the sum as compensation to the family of the late Abdulkadir, who eventually died at Madobi divisional police office after seven police officers beat the young man to unconsciousness. In his judgment, Obiora Atuegwu Egwuatu held that the action of the officers leading to the death of AbdulKadir violated the fundamental right to life of the deceased as cited by section 33 of 1999 Constitution as amended. The court directed the Inspector General of Police to institute appropriate punitive measures to sanction the indicted officers in line with the force discipline act. When contacted, the police spokesman in Kano, DSP Abdullahi Haruna, sought for time to get detail of the judgment before responding on the matter. He, however, did not respond before press time. The Police Public Relations Officer had, in October 2019, confirmed the incident where he disclosed four of the officers involved had been arrested for necessary disciplinary action. On October 30, 2019, the case of extrajudicial killing of the late AbdulKadir was reported at Madobi divisional police station, in Madobi Local Government area of Kano.
