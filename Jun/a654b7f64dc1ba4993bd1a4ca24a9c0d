• He Remains Suspended, Ward Chairman Insists The Executive Committee of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Ward 10 Etsako-West Local Council, Edo State, yesterday, said it has lifted the suspension slammed on the party’s National Chairman, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole. The Ward Secretary, Mr. Emuakemeh Sule, who led the executive members to the party’s National Secretariat in Abuja, said the resolution followed a review of the circumstances that led to Oshiomhole’s suspension, stressing that there was no merit in the allegation, or processes employed. “We hereby lift the suspension placed on Comrade Adams Oshiomhole by the ward. We call on organs of our great party to restore all rights and privileges of membership to Oshiomhole.” The party’s acting National Chairman, Senator Abiola Ajimobi, thanked the ward officials for invalidating Oshiomhole’s suspension. Represented by the National Vice Chairman, South-South, Prince Hilliard Etta, he said: “Let me say 17 of the 27 members signed this resolution. Let me also say that in matters of this nature, our constitution provides for a simple majority and 17 out of 27 is indeed more than a simple majority. So, we want to use this opportunity to thank Etsako West Ward 10 for what they have done. History will be on your side.” But the APC Chairman in Etsako Ward 10, Mr. Oshawo Stephen, dismissed claims that Oshiomhole’s suspension as a party member has been lifted, insisting the ward executive stands by the suspension. According to him, contrary statements are false and should be disregarded. In a statement, Mr. Stephen said the ward executives who were elected into office in 2018 remain intact, and have not been displaced by anybody, describing the claims of the lifting of the suspension as a charade. “The suspension of Comrade Adams Oshiomhole by the ward executives remains valid. The statements to the contrary in the media are false and should be disregarded. We stand by our decision and have no reservation on the action as it is in the best interest of the party. “The ward executives, as well as our counterparts at the Etsako West Local Government level, stand by the suspension of Comrade Oshiomhole for his divisive role in the crisis rocking the APC in Edo State.” Meanwhile, the Chairman APC in Etsako West Local Council, Ezolomhe Rabiat, also affirmed that the council executives were still members of the party in the state, and stand by Oshiomhole’s suspension.
