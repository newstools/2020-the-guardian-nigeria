 Alexandre de Juniac  At least one in every two airlines is now at risk of collapse given the dearth of lifesaving financial supports, the International Air Transport Association (IATA), has said.
  
IATA, the clearing house for over 280 airlines globally, said time was running out on urgent and desperate measures to save the airlines before July month-end.
  
While airlines in Nigeria are not an exception in the dire financial crisis facing the global aviation industry, a local carrier, Ibom Air, yesterday, appeared to be heading for safety. The Akwa Ibom State Government moved to rescue the airlines with an undisclosed bailout package.  
  
The IATA’s Director of Advocacy and Strategy, Africa, Funke Adeyemi, at a webinar forum, said the Association is working hard to get African Heads of State and organisations to give the needed financial assistance to the airlines.  “Cabin air in HEPA equipped aircraft generally pass through the filters 20-30 times per hour, removing contaminants and greatly enhancing the quality of air in the cabin. Therefore, when the suspension on a domestic flight is lifted, Ibom Air will offer one of the safest, if not safest domestic travel option during COVID19 pandemic in addition to other personal and respiratory hygiene guidelines already prescribed globally,” he said.
  
IATA’s Director-General and Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Alexandre de Juniac, earlier said financially, 2020 would go down as the worst year in the history of aviation.
  
“On average, every day of this year will add $230million to industry losses. In total that’s a loss of $84.3billion. It means that—based on an estimate of 2.2 billion passengers this year—airlines will lose $37.54 per passenger. That’s why government financial relief was and remains crucial as airlines burn through cash,” de Juniac said.
