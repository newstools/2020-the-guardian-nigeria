The mother of late Nigerian football legend Sam Okwaraji, Janet is dead at 83 years old. Janeth Okwaraji’s death was confirmed Monday by her eldest son, Patrick. Patrick said Nigeria’s sports minister Sunday Dare and the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) have been informed Janeth’s death. Janet Okwaraji was a retired school teacher and proprietress. Patrick stated that the family is yet to meet to discuss when and how the burial of their mother would take place. He said there will also be a meeting with the people Umudioka Community, in Orlu, Imo State, to determine the next move for their late mother’s burial while the date is not yet fixed. Nigeria President Muhammadu Buhari condoled with the family. Buhari in a statement by presidential spokesman Femi Adesina said as a mother, who lost her son in an unexpected situation, he believed that Janeth deserved to be acknowledged for her resilience and nobility, despite the odds. Janeth’s son, Sam Okwaraji died of heart failure on 12 August 1999 while playing for the Nigerian national team. “The President believes Lady Okwaraji, whose son, Samuel, died in August 1989 while playing for the Super Eagles in a World Cup qualifier, will always be remembered for the sacrifices of the family for the nation,” Adesina said. “President Buhari affirms that the matriarch of the Okwaraji family, like her son, defined simplicity, loyalty, and patriotism in many ways as she remained steadfast, believing in Nigeria, despite the vicissitude of life.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
