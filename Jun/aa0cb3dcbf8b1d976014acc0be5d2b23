Ihekweazu, who described his visit to the state as an eye opening experience, and a surprise at the state-of-the-art facilities provided at the Emergency Operations Centre (EOC), said: “This is actually a joint mission with the WHO. Coming to Akwa Ibom today has really been such an eye opening experience both at Ibom Specialist Hospital and this EOC that will be opened on June 23.  We are jointly pleasantly surprised at the opportunity this has presented to the country. This will probably be the best EOC in the whole country by the time it’s fully operational.” He said that the facilities available and quality of personnel had given the team a good impression on the healthcare services enjoyed by the people of the state and gave assurance that the Federal Government through the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 will work towards deepening collaboration with the state as regards healthcare delivery.

She said: “It’s been very enlightening going around to see the isolation facilities and the capacities that are there, the lab capacity and how the state has used the opportunity of the COVID-19 response to build institutional capacity, not just for responding to this outbreak but thinking beyond.” Speaking on behalf of the state government, the Secretary to the State Government and Chairman, Akwa Ibom State COVID-19 Management Committee, Dr. Emmanuel Ekuwem, expressed the gratitude of the government and people of Akwa Ibom State to the NCDC and WHO team for the visit to the state and for painstakingly going round to appreciate the vision of Governor Udom Emmanuel-led administration in the state.
