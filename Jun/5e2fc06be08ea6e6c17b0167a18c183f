A special adviser to President Muhammadu Buhari on political matters, Babafemi Ojudu, has accused the Vice Chairman of the All Progressives Congress in Ado-Ekiti local government area of Ekiti State, Sola Elesin, of witch-hunting him. Ojudu in a statement issued on Monday said Elesin led the thugs to attack his guard and broke into his Ado-Ekiti home on Monday because he criticised the state governor, Kayode Fayemi, in an interview. “Fast forward to early June. I granted an interview criticizing the governor for running a single man government in our state and for underperforming. The next thing was pressure on my ward executive to remove me from the party,” Ojudu said. “Of course they resisted, saying I have not done anything to warrant it. They are still at it arm-twisting the poor folks in the ward who unfortunately are my kinsmen.” “At 10.30 am, thugs led by the Ekiti State Vice Chairman of the party, Mr Sola Elesin, arrived at my house, assaulted my guard, broke the lock to the premises and dumped 13 bags of 25 KG rice. Like that really represented what was given to an entire state in March.” He said the invasion was recorded by the assailants and celebrated on social media. The former senator further accused the governor of not wading into the issue which had been reported. “Is this what has become of our state under Governor Fayemi? A state where a contest of ideas must descend into a contest of foolery?” he asked. He said his aides in Ado Ekiti had reported the incident to the police and made statements.
