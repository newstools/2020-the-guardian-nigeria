To ensure sustainability in its waste management and disposal efforts, the Lagos Waste Management Authority (LAWMA) had begun rehabilitation of its five legal dumpsites. The exercise, which involves building 21 platforms on the sites will ensure the seeing off of wastes within 20 minutes, thereby increasing the PSP operatorsâ€™ daily trips from 500 to 850. Acting Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of LAWMA, Ibrahim Odumboni, who disclosed this at an interactive session with newsmen, said the move would reshape waste collection and disposal in the state. He stressed that the operations of the 14,000 street-sweepers will also be reviewed to make them carry out night operations and ensure that cleaner city will be a morning gift for Lagos residents. LAWMA, he said, has also set minimum standards and performance indicators for the PSP operators to ensure the sustainability of its objective, while plans are on to establish at least a recycler in each of the 57 local councils and create employment. According to him, the authority is poised to return to its core activity of waste management and engagement with relevant stakeholders to know the challenges and address their concerns. He also indicated plans to reposition the blue box programme launched last year by the governor to ensure in-depth spread. On medical waste, he said the authority is reviewing its operations to ensure that medical wastes are well segregated from others and well treated to avoid compliance that can result in health challenges.
