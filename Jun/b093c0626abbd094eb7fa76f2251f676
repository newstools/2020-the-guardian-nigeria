As part of efforts to ensure a cleaner state, the Lagos State government is set to launch a waste management academy. This was disclosed by the acting Managing Director of Lagos Waste Management Authority (LAWMA), Mr Ibrahim Odumboni, saying it would inculcate the tenets of effective waste management into the younger ones. Through the programme, pupils, students, corps members and interns would have the opportunity of being taught the best practices in waste disposal and management as part of a meticulous strategy to making Lagos cleaner and more livable for all residents, he said. Various initiatives had been taken by the authority to improve waste management across the metropolis, he added, and that drastic measures had been put in place to enhance operational efficiency by operators, with particular emphasis on ensuring effective turnaround time at various dumpsites. Odumbomi urged Lagos residents to shun all forms of indiscriminate waste disposal, as this could have negative consequences on the environment and the public health. The Lagos residents, he added, should imbibe the culture of recycling and waste sorting.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
