The 44-year-old Chandelier singer admitted she felt like a ‘buffoon’ as social media users started calling her out on Twitter over the mistake. In a now-deleted tweet, one fan sent Sia a picture of Minaj and asked if she’d like to collaborate with her. Sia replied: I love @iamcardib and although this isn’t a collaboration, I would love to COLLAB with her any day! Social media users immediately picked up on the mistake, with one of the fans tweeting: Girl move that hair out yo face AND LOOK. As fans vented their feelings, the hashtag ‘Siaisoverparty’ began trending on Twitter. In response, Sia tweeted: I totally misunderstood a tweet earlier that has resulted in me making a buffoon out of myself. Sorry, @NICKIMINAJ and @iamcardib if you hear about it. Can I just like you both? When fans pointed out that Nicki and Cardi have a long-running feud, Sia urged them to focus on the real news of the moment instead, she then diverted her tweets to the deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. She wrote: There was a time I used the term all lives matter when I was trying to advocate for the trans community whom I was working closely with. But growth is being able to understand that saying can be offensive to people who felt like their lives NEVER mattered and that’s why #BLM However, Nicki and Cardi ignored the mix-up on their own social media pages. The duo has been feuding for years with tensions between them coming to a head at a New York fashion party in 2018 where Cardi was seen being escorted from the bash by security with a shoe missing and a bump on her forehead.
