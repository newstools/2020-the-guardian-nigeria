The 47-year-old Leicester manager saw his Liverpool team lose out by just two points to Manchester City in the 2013/14 season. Rodgers said he knew how much the Premier League title would mean to the supporters and was delighted for them. The former Celtic boss said he had texted Klopp, captain Jordan Henderson and the club owners. “Having witnessed it first-hand (being Liverpool boss), it’s an incredible moment in their history,” Rodgers said ahead of Sunday’s FA Cup quarter-final against Chelsea. “Having felt it while I was there, the desire for it, I’m delighted for Jurgen, and in particular these last few years going so close. “I’m delighted for Jordan Henderson, and for the supporters. “Wherever you travel in the world as Liverpool manager, they are there in their thousands. I’m pleased for the owners too. They came into it new, they’re fantastic owners.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
