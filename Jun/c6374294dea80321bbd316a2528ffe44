The Lagos State government, at the weekend, sealed various lounges, bars, spas and nightclubs across the state for flouting the governor’s order on closure of social clubs in a bid to curb the spread of coronavirus. The Director-General, Safety Commission, Mr. Lanre Mojola, disclosed this yesterday when he led the commission’s compliance and enforcement team to Lagos Island, Surulere, Abule-Egba and environs. He declared that the state has zero-tolerance for breach of safety guidelines and protocols, as it was observed that from preliminary investigation, some bars, spas, lounges and nightclubs were not complying with the safety guidelines and closure order as directed by the governor. According to him, a mass gathering of people in social clubs, spas and nightclubs during this pandemic negates safety guidelines. The director-general stated that the commission has started issuing provisional safety compliance certificates to social clubs that have registered and have had their facilities verified. He, therefore, urged centres that are yet to comply with the register-to-open initiative to do so, adding that facilities that had been registered, verified and issued certificates are remained closed until the stipulated guidelines and pronouncements to open is made by the governor.
