Kaori Dominick | Daily Star Porn actress Kaori Dominick has been declared wanted by the Colombian police for allegedly filming a sex scene without wearing a face mask. The sex scene in which Dominick stared was filmed in a bus in Cali, Colombia. It was then uploaded to Pornhub before it was later deleted, after breaking Valle del Cauca regulations that require a mask to be worn at all times on public transport. Dominick is seen in gloves and a facemask when she is approached by a man as she is buying a ticket for the bus. The pair agree for her to use a vibrator which is controlled by an application on the man’s phone and he records her while she uses it on the bus. On one of the scenes she can be seen to have removed her face mask, and this meant she broke the country’s health rules. The woman then reportedly gave the man her underwear as a memory as the video ends. The video is said to have been widely popular before it was taken down and the authorities are now working to confirm the identity of the man and woman in the clip. The pair could face fines for breaking safety measures ordered during Colombia’s coronavirus lockdown, according to reports. Oscar Ortiz, the President of Metrocali, the company in charge of buses in the city, said: “The porn video on the bus will be sent to the authorities in order to identify the actors.” | Image: Twitter/OscarOrtizCali The company added in a statement that the video showed a lack of respect for other bus users. The police investigation is ongoing and no fines or sanctions have been reported. According to the latest figures from the Johns Hopkins University, Colombia has registered 91,995 cases of COVID-19 and 3,256 related deaths.
