The state is among the four top with high number of cases, with Lagos topping the table with 5,135 cases, while Kano and the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, follow with 958 and 674 cases, respectively. According to Governor Aminu Masari, less than half of the fatality cases died at the isolation centre, as most of the victims were tested and found to be positive after they had died at home or elsewhere. A total of 14 council areas that were initially locked down due to the virus, have been reversed leaving only Katsina and Daura where more than 80 percent of the cases were identified. The state recorded its index case more than two months ago, after a private medical practioner, Dr Aliyu Yakubu tested positive to the virus. Yakubu had checked into hospital in Daura, where he complained of not feeling well, but died some munites later while doctors were trying to attend to him.
