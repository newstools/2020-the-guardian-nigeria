..Analysts predict gloomy outlook, blame speculations on fresh COVID-19 outbreak Despite the one-day public holiday declared by the Federal Government to commemorate Democracy Day, investors renewed appetite in bellwether stocks buoyed transactions at the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) last week, as the NSE All-Share index, and market capitalisation both appreciated by 0.67 per cent to close the week at 25,182.67, and N13.137trillion, respectively. All other indices finished higher with the exception of NSE MERI Growth, NSE Consumer Goods, and NSE Oil/Gas Indices, which depreciated by 0.07 per cent, 0.20 per cent, and 2.62 per cent respectively, while NSE ASeM closed flat But analysts at the weekend predicted gloomy outlook, citing possible impact of the second wave of the coronavirus. For instance, analysts at Vetiva Dealing and Brokerage, said: “With speculations around the possible impact of the second wave of the coronavirus hitting countries around the world, as well as the decline in prices of crude oil due to weak demand, we expect some level of jittery and negative reaction at the start of next week. Barring any positive event that is capable of uplifting sentiment.” Codros Capital Limited, said: “In our opinion, risks remain on the horizon due to a combination of the increasing number of COVID-19 cases in Nigeria and weak economic conditions. Thus, we continue to advise investors to trade cautiously and seek trading opportunities in only fundamentally justified stocks.” The Chief Executive Officer, Investdata Consulting Limited, Ambrose Omordion, said: “The mixed trend is likely to continue, MACD crossing down the signal line to bearish region indicates pullback or sell down. This also implies that opportunities are still available as sectorial rotation continues ahead of the Q2 earnings reports start hitting the market. “Also, sectors that have suffered oversold, so far, offer attractive risk-reward buy-opportunities and outlook for consideration ahead of the Q2 economic and corporate data.” However, he argued that the current undervalued state of the market offers opportunities to position for the short, medium and long-term, urging investors to sound and dividend-paying stocks for possible capital appreciation going forward. A breakdown of activities last week showed that investors’ appetite in bellwethers lifted transactions on Monday, causing market capitalisation to appreciate N122billion.
