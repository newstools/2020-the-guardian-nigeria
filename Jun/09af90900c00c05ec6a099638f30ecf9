Health ministry spokeswoman Sima Sadat Lari said 2,238 new infections in the past 24 hours took the total to 180,156. She said 78 new deaths brought the overall toll to 8,584. Iran reported its first COVID-19 cases on February 19 — two deaths in the Shiite holy city of Qom. The government has struggled to contain what quickly became the Middle East’s deadliest coronavirus outbreak. Since April, however, it has gradually lifted health protocols in order to reopen its sanctions-hit economy. That has coincided with a fresh surge in cases, which the government denies amounts to a second wave, saying they are due to increased testing.
