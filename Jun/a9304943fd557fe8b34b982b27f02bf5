The Delta State Council of Traditional Rulers has called on the Federal Government and other relevant authorities to apply the maximum weight of the law on perpetrators of rape and other gender-based violence. The advice was contained in a four-point communiqué issued at the end of their quarterly meeting in Asaba, a copy of which was made available to The Guardian, yesterday. Chairman of the Council and Obi of Owa, Dr. Emmanuel Efeizomor 11, who read the communiqué, condemned in strongest terms the alarming rate of rape cases reported daily in the country. He pledged the body’s support to the fight against the act and called on the judiciary and law enforcement agencies to handle rape issues with a high sense of justice. He insisted that anyone caught in the dastardly act should face the full weight of the law. “We call on government at all levels to come out with more stringent measures to curtail the ugly trend. We encourage rape victims to speak out. We appeal to lawyers and Judges to exercise human face in handling rape-related issues, to enable perpetrators and their cohorts get a quick judgment as a deterrent to others,” he said. The Council also urged its members to adopt whistle-blowing measures to arrest and prosecute drug dealers, who sell hard drugs to rapists. The royal fathers cautioned against stigmatisation of victims, saying rape should be tackled with utmost seriousness and high sense of commitment. They expressed total support for all steps taken by Governor Ifeanyi Okowa to tackle security challenges and enjoined him to remain steadfast and focused. They also congratulated him for his developmental efforts in the last five years, promising their support to the actualisation of the ‘Stronger Delta Vision.’ To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
