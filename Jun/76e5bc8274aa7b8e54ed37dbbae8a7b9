The Chairman of National Hajj Commission of Nigeria, (NAHCON), Alhaji Zikirullah Olakunle Hassan, has met with contractors handling various hajj development levy projects to assess the level of work accomplished from time of award of a contract to date. In attendance at the meeting were project supervisors and other relevant officials from the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing. Also in attendance were the three permanent Commissioners and senior management staff of the Commission. The meeting was at the behest of the NAHCON Chairman and management in order to speed up work on the sites and to determine whether there are any circumstances hindering completion of the projects. The meeting was seen as necessary if Nigerian pilgrims are to start enjoying the utilities as soon as possible. The meeting, therefore, paved the way to hasten work at the sites with deadlines issued for completion. It would be recalled that NAHCON is constructing various amenities across the country for use by pilgrims and for revenue generation during non-Hajj operational periods. The constructions include hotel-like structures for camping of intending pilgrims before airlift, construction of clinics, event centres, mosques, and perimeter fencing among others. Works at the several sites in all the geopolitical zones are at advanced levels while some have been completed.
