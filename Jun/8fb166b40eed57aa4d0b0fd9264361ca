Also disqualified were Matthew Aigbuhuenze Iduoriyekemwen and Chris Ogiemwonyi from participating in the primaries aimed at selecting the standard-bearer of the party for the governorship poll. The Professor Ayuba Jonathan-led panel however cleared Osaro Obazee, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu and Dr Pius Odubu to vie in the primaries election. The panel said the decision by both Obaseki and Iduoriyekemwen to drag the APC and the national chairman of the party, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole to court in defiance to the provision of the APC constitution as the basis for the decision. The panel particularly picked holes with the National Youth Service Certificate (NYSC) and the testimonial of the Institute of Continuing Education Benin city submitted by Governor Obaseki. The panel further justified the decision to disqualify Ogiemwonyi on the basis that there was inconsistency in the names on the documents presented to the screening committee. Oshiomhole who received the report expressed gratitude to members of the committee adding that it behoves on aspirants dissatisfied with the findings of the committee to take their case to the appeal committee instituted by the party. Oshiomhole argued that the decision to screen the aspirants was in tandem with the resolve of the party to deepen the tenets of democracy in the country. Ogiemwonyi, who was sighted at the national secretariat of the party, was overheard saying that he would surely appeal the decision of the screening committee.
