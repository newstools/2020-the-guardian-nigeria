It will be the first time the 32-year-old has played since he scored the winner against Real Sociedad on March 7. That victory sent Barcelona back to the top of the table, two points ahead of Real Madrid. Messi has scored 24 goals in 31 appearances for Barca this term. La Liga returned on Thursday as Sevilla beat Real Betis 2-0, bringing an end to 93 days without matches while the coronavirus suspension was in place. Teams will play their remaining 11 fixtures in less than six weeks, with the season scheduled to finish on July 19.
