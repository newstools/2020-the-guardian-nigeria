It Reveals the life of an average prostitute and quest for survival, it was a combination of serious humour, empathy, and emotion. The veteran director and CEO of Zeb Ejiro Productions, Mr. Zeb Ejiro said: When we first made Domitilla, it was a story inspired by societal challenges that have over time, proven to not only be akin to the ’90s, but trans-generational; and so, in recognition of its relevance in these times, we have decided to make a sequel to the story, factoring recent socio-cultural advancements.

In Domitilla, we have identified an entertaining and artistic masterpiece that would appeal to different generations of film lovers; and to know we are partnering with great professionals in Zeb Ejiro and Omoni Oboli is soothing. Thus, we look forward to a phenomenal accomplishment. The initial Domitilla released in 1996 starred A-list actors such as Anne Njemanze, Sandra Achums, Kate Henshaw, Adah Ameh, and Enebeli Elebuwa, to mention a few. However, the sequel will be a showcase of an artistic harmony between veterans and younger actors. Speaking about the project, ace Nollywood actress and director Omoni Oboli said: When I was a teenager, I auditioned for Domitilla but I didn’t get any part; perhaps, I was too tiny.
