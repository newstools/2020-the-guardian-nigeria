It was a relief for five communities in Ijebu-Igbo area of Ogun State as Dangote Granite Mines Limited, a subsidiary of Dangote Group, provided palliatives and awarded scholarships to students in the communities as part of efforts to give back and ameliorate the suffering of the people. The palliatives were handed over to residents while the cheques for the scholarship awards were handed over to the Ijebu-Igbo traditional leader in his palace, who in turn gave them to the community heads for onward distribution to their children. Leading the management team of Dangote Projects to the Ijebu-Igbo palace, Mr. Fola Ebenezer Ali, the Group General Manager, Human Resources, said the company would continue to do whatever would promote progress and development in the communities where it mines granite. He explained that the management would have loved to gather the awardees together in an elaborate ceremony, but the global safety protocols to follow in view of the COVID-19 pandemic would not permit that, and the management decided to present the cheques to the ruler. According to him, the cheques for the secondary school beneficiaries were made out in the names of individual students while those of the higher institutions across the country were drawn in the name of institutions where the students are studying. Ali explained further that the food palliatives had earlier been distributed to the families before the ease of the lockdown in Lagos, Ogun and FCT, and that various food items were given out to cushion the effect of the lockdown on the people. The Sopelukale of Ijebu-Igbo, Oba Mufutau Yusuf, Erinkiola 1, expressed appreciation to Aliko Dangote for the good gestures in alleviating the hardship faced by the people. He assured the management team that the people would not disappoint the company and would do all to maintain peace, saying his people are peace-loving.
