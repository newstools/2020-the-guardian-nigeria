This is coming after an earlier report we made about her announcement of their upcoming marriage. She announced she is engaged to her 20-year-old boyfriend Vladimir, having split from his father Alexey, 45, whom she was married to for 10 years. In an Instagram video, she shared the happy news with Vladimir by handing him the positive pregnancy stick, after which they shared an emotional embrace. She explained she is only four weeks gone and admitted they had decided to tie the knot due to the baby. In the post alongside some pictures, she said: I’m tired of hiding. Everything is possible in this world. We are four weeks and yes. That is why we decided to get married. Marina, who hails from the western Russian region of Krasnodar Krai, reportedly adopted her ex’s five children while they were together. Last month she sparked outrage after sharing a photo of herself with Vladimir 13 years ago when he was aged seven. Marina added she is very much in love with Vladimir, and the couple is helping to raise three of his siblings. Last month in the post where they announced their marriage, she said: You never know how life will turn out and when you will meet a person who makes you smile. I know that some will judge us, others will support us, but we are happy and wish you to be as well. Many were left outraged following the post and said it was immoral to start a relationship with the child that she had helped to raise.
