Stockbrokers at the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), have described the recent oversubscription of the Sukuk Ijarsh, as a confirmation of the market’s absorptive capacity, urging the Federal Government to float more fixed income securities to finance infrastructure deficit.
 
Recently, the Federal Government floated an N150 billion Sukuk Ijarah, a financial instrument for ethical investors that provides regular bi-annual tax-free payment with a seven-year maturity, and it was oversubscribed in excess of 400 percent.
 
Appraising the historic subscription of the instrument at the weekend, despite the inclement operating environment, securities dealers at the Exchange ascribed the success to factors such as investor confidence, as the instrument is project-tied, and assurance of ease of redemption being backed by the full weight of the government.  “The FGN Sukuk was oversubscribed by over 400%, which has never happened in any public offer in Nigeria both in equity and bonds. This confirmed the confidence people have in Sukuk. It can be attributed to the underlying structure of Sukuk, which is based on the existing projects, and people can see across the country as shown on the road network.
 
“Therefore, the investors are living testimonies of the projects, unlike a bond, which cannot be directly attached to a project. Osun State started it, but now FGN has taken it up, and this is the third Sukuk despite lower rates compared with first and second, which were 16.47% and 15.74%, respectively.
 
“Although the rate has crashed to 11.20 per cent, a reduction of 5.27 per cent or by 33 per cent, yet it was over-subscribed. It shows that FGN and states can employ this instrument for infrastructure development as done in other jurisdictions,” Kurfi said.
