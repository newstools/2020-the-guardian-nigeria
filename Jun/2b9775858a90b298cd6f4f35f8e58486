A rights activist, Dr. Joe Okei-Odumakin, has advocated the disbandment of the COVID-19 task force along the Ojodu-Abiodun area of Lagos State. She also sought stiffer penalty against the officer who allegedly brutalised a female motorist recently. There had been a viral video on social media of a case of assault on a lady at Ojodu Abiodun area of Ifo Local Council where an officer punctured a female motorist’s tyre while another kicked her while trying to record the officer’s action. The Transition Chairman of the council, Fola Salami, had ordered the suspension of all officials involved without pay until further notice. But speaking on the development, yesterday, Okei-Odumakin said that the suspension was not enough punishment for the bestiality displayed on camera by those officials, stressing that those who assaulted the woman in question must be dismissed from office and be made to face the full wrath of the law to serve as deterrence unto others. She said: “It is like the officials of that office have been specially selected and specifically trained and commanded to brutalise and oppress motorists. “They do not behave like public servants at all as they usually see themselves as above the law. Their impunity rankles. Whatever remorse they show now will not last. That office should be disbanded. The apology of the council boss is okay but is not enough.” She, therefore, advised conscionable Nigerians to take note of Ojodu-Abiodun and constantly put the workers there under watch.
