Due to the impact of COVID-19, and challenges many Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are currently facing, the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA), and the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), United Kingdom, have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) targeted at ensuring SMEs remain afloat.
 
The MoU sees ACCA joining forces with ICC in its, “Save Our SMEs” (SOS) global campaign, as well as sharing professional insights research.  These businesses form the backbone of the economy and governments globally must give them the support they need throughout the crisis, or they risk incurring long-term economic damage.” During the period, both organisations noted that options would be explored to work together on co-branded research projects, policy development and co-hosted events around critical issues for businesses.
 
These, according to them, would leverage the diverse and complementary know-how of “our networks to support SMEs globally, and drive inclusive growth and prosperity.”
 
“ACCA and ICC will work together to share with their respective memberships’ insights and guidance to sustain SMEs and the SMPs that support them throughout the current crisis and beyond. They will also invite their stakeholders to take part in each other’s events and research initiatives,” ACCA said.
