Governor Gboyega Oyetola of Osun State yesterday warned erring worship centres and traders in markets in the state to be prepared for shutdown if they continue to flout COVID-19  regulations. Besides, the governor has extended the relaxation of curfew imposed to curb the spread of the virus in the state by another two weeks, effective from today. This follows the expiration of the initial two-week relaxation ordered by the governor on June 5, 2020. The curfew now runs from 9:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m. daily. Oyetola, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Ismail Omipidan, urged all citizens to comply with Coronavirus guidelines, saying that erring individuals would be sanctioned while worship centres and markets in the state risk being shut down. The governor, who expressed displeasure at the level of compliance with some of the relaxation guidelines, especially the wearing of face-masks in public places, warned that worship centres and markets that fail to adhere to the guidelines would be shut down by the state government. “COVID-19 is real and Osun State is not out of the woods yet. “The government will not fold its hands while a few people jeopardise the mileage we have recorded so far in this fight. It is not yet uhuru and strict enforcement will commence immediately. Any worship centre, market or motor-park where people do not wear face-mask or maintain physical distancing will be shut down,” the governor said. He also reminded the citizens that the an on inter-state travels remains in force, noting that any motor-park that fails to comply with the directive will be shut down as well.
