Ekiti State All Progressives Congress (APC) and the state’s former Governor, Mr Ayodele Fayose, have traded words over crisis rocking the party, which led to four people laying claim to the party’s chairmanship. Fayose had described the crisis in APC as a show of God’s anger against the party for its role in impoverishing Nigerians, promoting election rigging and looking the other way, when Nigerians were being killed in thousands. In a statement, Ekiti APC Director, Media and Publicity, Elder Sam Oluwalana, noted that the same Fayose has been hobnobbing with the party’s leaders across the country seeking favours. He stated that during Fayose’s alleged four years misrule in the state, he was the executive, legislature and judiciary, crippling the other arms of government. In a statement by Fayose’s Spokesperson, Lere Olayinka, the former governor had said no one could lay claim to the office of APC National Chairman in whatever capacity, adding that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) must be mindful of being seen as helping APC to uphold illegalities.
