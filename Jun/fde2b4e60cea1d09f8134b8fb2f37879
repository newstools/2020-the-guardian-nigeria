The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has been urged to interrogate the financial misappropriation crisis rocking Lagos State House of Assembly, as allegations and counter-allegations are now in the public domain.
   
A Lagos-based political activist/social critic, Chief Adesumbo Onitiri, who made the appeal yesterday, in Lagos, said the step becomes necessary due to the “odious noise from the House of Assembly, which is becoming very disturbing and distasteful” on daily basis.
 
He also urged Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu and Lagos State Government to give an account of all monies received as donations for the COVID-19 palliatives and how the money was spent. “Lagosians are now interested in knowing if it is true the Speaker is spending the taxpayer’s money judiciously or not. Moreso, when President Muhammadu Buhari has just signed Presidential Order 10, total freedom for financial autonomy for the State Assemblies and National Judiciary into law.
   
“This gives all State Assemblies and our Judiciary freedom and direct access to monies from Federal Allocation,” Onitiri said.He pointed out that there is therefore need for State Assemblies to be prudent and transparent in public spending. Onitiri explained that the allegations against the Lagos State Assembly were that the Speaker is misusing public money for himself and his wife.
 
“The EFCC or any Police authority in charge of fraud should probe these allegations in the interest of the public and moreso, that the APC government’s cardinal campaign issue was based on anti-corruption….” “This probe will be necessary in the interest of the public and the Speaker himself. No allegations should be swept under the carpet or be overlooked,” he stated. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
