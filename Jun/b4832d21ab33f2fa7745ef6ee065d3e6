The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) has raised an alarm over the possibility of over 47 million women losing access to modern contraceptives, should the ongoing restrictions necessitated by COVID-19 continues for the next six months. The situation, if not urgently addressed, it said, could lead to about seven million unwanted pregnancies. The Director, Reproductive Health Unit, Federal Ministry of Health, Dr. Kayode Afolabi, speaking at a media parley by Network of Reproductive Health Journalists Nigeria (NRHJN), in collaboration with Marie Stopes Nigeria (MSION), said the ministry is leaving no stone unturned to ensure that women have access to modern contraceptives amidst the ongoing lockdown. Speaking via a webinar conference, on ‘sustaining family planning and sexual Reproductive health services delivery amidst Covid-19,’ the federal government, according to him, is strengthening community-based family planning programmes, which would ensure that family planning clients receive services and commodities within their communities, including humanitarian settings. Urging members of the Network not to relent in their efforts in promoting reprisal health, the ministry, he said, is working tirelessly to ensure that maternity units have isolation equipped for delivery. Also speaking, the Country Director, Marie Stopes, Effiom Nyong Effiom, said despite the lockdown and restriction, her organisation has continued to provide sexual and reproductive health services across the country.
