Kim Kardashian and Kanye West | Yahoo Sports Kanye West is known for making gnomic statements on social media so it comes as no surprise that he is celebrating his wife Kim Kardashian’s new billionaire status in an unusual way. It appears that reality TV star and entrepreneur Kim Kardashian is the latest member of the exclusive billionaire club after Coty bought a $200m (£162m) stake in her KKW Beauty brand. Coty, the US cosmetics giant, has bought a 20% stake in KKW Beauty, valuing the reality TV star’s three-year-old business at $1bn (£815m). Upon learning of his wife’s billionaire status, West he posted a tweet featuring a bizarre message, flowers and vegetables. The rapper cum designer wrote: “I am so proud of my beautiful wife Kim Kardashian West for officially becoming a billionaire. “You’ve weathered the craziest storms and now God is shining on you and our family So blessed this is still life So I made you this still life We love you so much.” The message, which some described as a poem, was accompanied by a picture of a pepper, a cherry tomato, a green tomato and a couple of flowers, one of which appeared to be a pink rose. Speaking about her deal with Coty, Kim who is also an aspiring lawyer told TMZ: “This relationship will allow me to focus on the creative elements that I’m so passionate about while benefiting from the incredible resources of Coty, and launching my products around the world.” Kim’s deal with Coty is not a new one to the Kardashian-Jenner clan as Coty also invested in sister Kylie Jenner’s line in 2019. This is not the only deal in the family as 43-year-old West struck a 10 year deal to work together with Gap. West will now have his designer Yeezy line at the retailer. The partnership will have Gap introduce the hitmaker’s merchandise in the first half of 2021.
