With a recent offer for its 57 marginal oil fields to investors after 17 years gathering momentum, the Federal Government, through the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) has said plans are underway to commercialise its 96 gas flare points in a bid to generate revenue and ensure domestic consumption of gas.
 
With unstable oil prices, the Federal Government has continued to explore measures to generate revenue, including sourcing for loans from multilateral agencies to finance its 2020 budget.
  
According to the DPR, the move was part of plans to reduce gas flaring in the country and in line with the first phase of the National Gas Flare Commercialisation Programme (NGFCP).
 
Besides, the agency addressed concerns about its marginal oil field bid rounds, stating that fields that are under litigation were not included in the 57 fields being offered to investors.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
