Lagos State Government Tuesday said it has not granted approval for the hosting of any entertainment show in the State, regardless of nature or modification given to such shows or concerts. “I am saying it emphatically that there is no “drive-in-concert” or any show in that respect allowed in Lagos for now, we have not granted any approval for such,” Commissioner for Tourism, Arts and Culture, Uzamat AkinbiIe-Yusuf said in a statement on Tuesday. “We just want those in this sector to register their facilities with the State Safety Commission in preparation for the ease of the lockdown presently on their operations.” The Commissioner also clarified that the records are being set straight to properly guide stakeholders in the industry, especially those in the entertainment and show business. She advised those in the entertainment industry to only prepare their facilities and put necessary measures in place, pending when Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu will approve the resumption of their operations. Akinbile-Yusuf also maintained that since the safety of individuals cannot be guaranteed, there is no point organising any entertainment or musical concert. She emphasised that the State government would not apply emotions to issues bordering on the safety of the residents. Akinbile-Yusuf urged those spreading the misleading information on shows and concerts to desist from increasing tension in the sector. “Our position in the Ministry of Tourism, Arts and Culture is ‘no safety, no activity’,” Akinbile-Yusuf said. “We hope that when the COVID-19 curve gets flattened, activities will resume to the sector.” Lagos State is currently the epic centre of coronavirus in Nigeria. Out of 16,658 confirmed cases in Nigeria as at July 16, the state has recorded 7,319 cases of coronavirus with 1,137 recoveries and 82 deaths.
