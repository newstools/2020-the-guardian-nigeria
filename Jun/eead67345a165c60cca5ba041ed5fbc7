With many producers deploying their backward integration plan programmes, daily milk collection from farmers has hit all-time high record of 40 tons (40,000 litres) in the country. Specifically, FrieslandCampina WAMCO, stated that fresh milk collection in the country through its Dairy Development Programme (DDP) has hit 40,000 litres. The Managing Director, FrieslandCampina WAMCO Nigeria, Ben Langat, made the announcement as part of the company’s celebration of the World Milk Day 2020 in line with its grass to glass philosophy. He said, “We have been making steady progress in our commitment to the development of Nigeria’s dairy sector through our Dairy Development Programme and our efforts are yielding good results as we continue to keep our promise of providing nourishing dairy nutrition to millions of Nigerians.” As the first dairy company to collect over 40,000 litres of fresh milk per day from local farmers, FrieslandCampina WAMCO has taken its thriving DDP, which it started with pastoralists in local communities in Oyo State, and replicated it across other states, according to Ore Famurewa, the Executive Director, Corporate Affairs, FrieslandCampina WAMCO. She said, “In addition to Oyo State where we started the Dairy Development Programme 10 years ago, we have expanded our investments and operations to Ogun, Osun, Kwara and Niger states, especially in the last three years and have networked over 7000 dairy farmers.” “We remain committed to the goals of sustainable development, including poverty reduction, women empowerment, in the dairy sector and beyond as envisioned by the Federal Government.” “Our crossbreeding programme is yielding good results with over 400 F1 cows born to farms of local dairy farmers. We have developed dairy farms feeds to ensure all year round pasture for the cows and continued with our biannual Farmer2Farmer programme, facilitated by Dutch dairy experts ” Famurewa said. Under its Dairy Development Programme, FrieslandCampina WAMCO has transformed the mindset, productivity and livelihood of both male and female dairy farmers across five states where it operates the DDP. In its response to the scourge of the COVID-19 global pandemic, especially among its DDP volunteers and extension workers, FrieslandCampina WAMCO’s mitigation strategy has been to consistently create awareness about the pandemic and what to do. “We have sensitized our farmers on the hazards and symptoms of the coronavirus disease, what to do to keep safe and healthy, and the fact that it is a personal responsibility to protect themselves and family against the virus” explained John Adekunle, DDP Manager, FrieslandCampina WAMCO.
