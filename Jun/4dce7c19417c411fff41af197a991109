Nigeria President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday expressed his displeasure on the recent rape and violence against women in the country “I am particularly upset at recent incidents of rape, especially of very young girls,” Buhari said in his televised Democracy Day address. Buhari’s comment was against the backdrop of rape and murder of a University of Benin nursing student Uwaila Vera Omozuwa and another 18-year-old lady, Barakat Bello, in her home in Ibadan. Omozuwa was studying near her home at a Redeem Christian Church of God at Amadasun Street, Ohovbe, Ikpoba Hill, Benin City on Wednesday the 27th of May, 2020, Edo State when she was reportedly raped and murdered by unknown persons. She died in the hospital three days after the attack. Less than 72 than hours after the Omozuwa’s death, Bello had gone to the bathroom, bathing when she heard a noise close to their house, and subsequently, she left the bathroom built separately from the house to check what was happening. It was while walking towards the house she realised it was robbers that broke into the compound. The robbers attacked and strangled her, then took turn to rape her after which she was stabbed to death. Nigerians took to social media to protest the violence against these two ladies and some other rape victims shared their experience and also named their molesters. Buhari said his administration was aware of the violent crimes against the women and that his government would fight Gender-Based violence and make sure the perpetrators of this heinous crime are brought to justice. “I wish to assure all our women of this administration’s determination to fight Gender-Based Violence through the instrumentality of the law and awareness creation,” Buhari said. “The Police are pursuing these cases with a view to bringing perpetrators of these heinous crimes to swift justice,” he added.
