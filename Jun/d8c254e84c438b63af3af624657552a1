The Federal Capital Territory Ministerial Enforcement Task Force on COVID-19 Restrictions on Sunday sealed Jabi Lake Mall indefinitely for violating the government’s directive on ban on public gathering. “The FCT Ministerial Task Team on #COVID19 seals up Jabi Lake Mall indefinitely for violating Presidential Task Force’s directives on the ban on public gatherings as part of measures to contain the spread of the dreaded pandemic in the territory,” the Federal Capital Territory Authority said on Twitter on Sunday. The mall was used by PlayNetwork Africa and Traffic Bar for a music concert, meant to be a ‘drive-in-concert’, which featured Nigerian musician, Azeez Fashola, popularly known as Naira Marley. Naira Marley might also be arrested for being recalcitrant. He was arrested for violating lockdown orders in April. Apart from being at the concert, Naira Marley also reportedly flew from Lagos to Abuja despite the ban on interstate movement and non-essential flights. On April 6, 2020, the artiste was picked up by the police for violating the lockdown rules in Lagos State by attending a house party organised by actress, Funke Akindele, and her husband Abdul Rasheed Bello. He was later released after tendering a written apology to the Lagos State Government and signing an undertaking that he would henceforth comply with the government’s stay-at-home and social distancing directives; and that he would go into 14-day self-isolation, having attended a crowded birthday party.
