The Nigerian chapter of the International Lawyers Assisting Workers (ILAW) network has urged the Federal Government to speedily ratify the International Labour Organisation (ILO) Convention No. 190 on violence and harassment in the world of work, as one of the most effective ways to mark this year’s International Day for the elimination of sexual violence in conflict. Speaking during a virtual meeting held yesterday, a Human Rights lawyer, Dr. Femi Aborisade for ILAW said Nigeria would be making history if the ILO Convention No. 190 is promptly ratified. 
 
Listing some of the benefits Nigeria would derive if it promptly ratifies the ILO convention, Aboridade said: “It would protect the right of everyone to a world of work free from violence and harassment. The Convention recognises that behaviours that subject the other person to violence and harassment constitute human rights violation issues. It thus provides a framework to prevent, remedy and eliminate violence and harassment in the world of work, including gender-based violence and harassment.” He noted that the benefits are necessary, given the phenomenally rising rate of conflicts, crises, violence, multiple forms of socio-economic and political tensions, Boko Haram insurgency, abuses in Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) camps, wanton and arbitrary police killings, and particularly the alarming incidents of rape and killing of rape victims.
 
He added that on account of the foregoing judicial pronouncement, ILAW (Nigeria) urges the Federal Government to ratify ILO Convention No. 190, by Executive action, without any further delay. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
