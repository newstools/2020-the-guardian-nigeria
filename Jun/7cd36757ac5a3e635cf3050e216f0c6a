Experts yesterday advocated collective action to cushion the negative effects of COVID-19 on the nation’s economy in 2020 and beyond, stressing that the scourge presents challenges and opportunities in all sectors. They stated this during a webinar hosted by the Tokunbo Orimobi Foundation with the theme: “Nigeria in 2020, The COVID-19 Effect.” The session was moderated by Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer of Kairos Capital, Sam Chidoka and featured a panel discussion by thought leaders in the hospitality, banking, insurance, aviation and healthcare sectors. Also, former Managing Director, SunTrust Bank Nigeria Limited, Ayo Babatunde, Managing Director, Anchor Insurance Company Limited, Augustine Ebose, Chief Finance Officer, Arik Air, Ayodeji Ilesanmi, Managing Director, Paelon Memorial Hospital, Dr. Ngozi Onyia and Managing Director, KFA Rentals, Kemi Adeleke attended the session. However, the panellists raised concerns over the number of patients that have tested positive for coronavirus in the country. Onyia, a paediatrician, made a strong case for the existence of COVID-19 in Nigeria by citing cases of patients who had tested positive for the virus. She expressed concern that some Nigerians still believed the pandemic was not real, while the panellists agreed that while the crisis remained first and foremost a public health issue, the economic fallouts have been overwhelming in various sectors. President, Tokunbo Orimobi Foundation, Michael Orimobi, who noted that webinar was one of the foundation’s corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives, said the topic was apt for the period.
