Kanye West Image Insider Kanye West has decided to expand his Yeezy clothing and sneaker line into beauty and skincare products and he has filed legal documents for trademarks in make-up, face masks, nail polish, shaving cream, deodorants, aromatherapy pillows, and more. His new business expansion will be in direct competition with his wife Kim Kardashian and his half sister-in-law Kylie Jenner. Kim Kardashian West founded both KKW Beauty and KKW Fragrance in 2017, which are carried in Ulta and Sephora stores while Kylie launched Kylie Cosmetics in 2015 and Kylie Skin in 2019, which are also carried in Ulta and Sephora stores. Kanye West also recently joined the Billionaires club when he told Forbes magazine his net worth is registered as $1.3billion (£1.05billion). Recently, the “Ye” singer has been actively involved in the BLM movement. He reportedly donated $2M to George Floyd causes even setting up a 529 college savings fund for his six-year-old daughter Gianna after he was murdered May 25 by four Minneapolis cops. Kanye has been a frequent source of controversy for his conduct at award shows, on social media, and in other public settings, as well as for his comments on the music and fashion industries, U.S. politics, and race. His Christian faith, as well as his marriage to television personality Kim Kardashian, have also been a source of media attention. As a fashion designer, he has collaborated with Nike, Louis Vuitton, and A.P.C. on both clothing and footwear, and have most prominently resulted in the Yeezy collaboration with Adidas beginning in 2013. He is the founder and head of the creative content company DONDA. He has won a total of 21 Grammy Awards, making him one of the most awarded artists of all time. Kim is yet to say anything regarding the news.
