It was commendation galore and a reflection on life at the eight day fidau prayers held at the weekend for the deceased monarch, the Oniba of Iba land, Oba Yushau Goriola Oseni, who joined his ancestors at the age of 77. He was largely described as a peace-loving detribalized Nigerian who brought development to Iba in the nearly 45 years he spent on the throne. His daughter and chairman of Iba LCDA, Princess Ramot Rachel Adedayo Oseni, said: “I will miss everything about my father. Nobody can fill that void. He has been a good leader to the people, especially the way he administered justice within the community and the role he played to foster development. “Before his death, he assisted the local government to acquire a plot of land for the establishment of a secondary school in Iba. He was so passionate about development and would say Iba as the head of communities in Iba LCDA should have a secondary school of its own. He would be sorely missed. He was always fostering peace between indigenes and non-indigenes, always reminding anyone that we are all strangers on earth and we should live together in peace for the few years God spares our lives.” Also speaking, the chairman of Iru-Victoria Island LCDA, Princess Rasheedat Abiodun Adu, said he was a father to all. “He always harped on the fact that we should put our community first as council chairmen because it is the people that gave us the mandate. This has helped me as a person to grow and paddle the canoe in my service to the people at our local government. He was always saying he looks forward to see us reach our heights even beyond being a council chairman. God is higher and greater than everyone of us, he proposed that but today, he is no more.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
