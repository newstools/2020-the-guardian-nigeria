The Ministerial Council of African Petroleum Producersâ€™ Organisation (APPO) decided at its 38th session on the 15th June 2020 to move the temporary headquarters of the organisation from Abuja, Nigeria to the permanent headquarters in Brazzaville, Republic of Congo. Apart from ratifying the movement to its headquarters to Congo, APPO also approved the new Host Country Agreement between the Republic of Congo and APPO, and directed the secretary-general of the organisation, Dr Omar Farouk Ibrahim to sign it on behalf of APPO. According to a statement issued by Bakary Traore, who is of APPO Secretariat in Abuja, the Council said global lockdowns and restrictions in travels, directed the secretary-general to liaise with the authorities of Congo on a mutually acceptable date for the effective date of the relocation. It will be recalled that APPO headquarters was temporarily moved to Abuja in 2018 when Nigeria assumed the Presidency of the Organisation with a mandate to execute the approved reform programme of the organisation.
