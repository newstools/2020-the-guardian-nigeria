Canadian singer The Weeknd has donated $500,000 to various organizations in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement amid protests demanding justice for George Floyd. The Weeknd shared a series of receipts of the donations along with ‘thank you’ messages from recipients after making his donations on June 1st. In the accompanying caption, he wrote: “keep supporting our brothers and sisters out there risking everything to push for actual change for our black lives. Urging everyone with big pockets to give and give big and if you have less please give what you can even if it’s a small amount.”   A post shared by The Weeknd (@theweeknd) on Jun 1, 2020 at 9:18pm PDT  The singer’s accompanying posts show he donated $200,000 to the Black Lives Matter Global Network, a further $200,000 to American football quarterback Colin Kaepernick’s Know Your Rights campaign, and $100,000 to National Bail Out, a black-led collective of abolitionist organisers. A ‘thank you’ message from Know Your Rights reads: “Dear Abel, thank you very much for your generous contribution in support of the Know Your Rights camp. Your gift will help the liberation and well-being of Black and Brown communities.” This is coming after Drake donated $100,000 to the National Bail Out on Monday. In his Instagram stories, Drake shared a receipt for his $100,000 donation to the charity after songwriter Mustafa the Poet urged him to exceed his own contribution. The donations come as racial tension continues to boil over across the United States, sparked by the senseless killing of black man George Floyd by white police officer Derek Chauvin in Minneapolis on May 25th.
