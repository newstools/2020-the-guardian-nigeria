Gov. Simon Lalong of Plateau has congratulated the newly elected Chairman of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) Plateau State Chapter, Rev. Fr. Polycarp Lubo. The governor also congratulated other members of Lubo’s executive following their election on Saturday, June 6. Lalong, in a congratulatory message, by his Director of Press and Public Affairs, Dr Makut Macham, on Sunday in Jos, said the peaceful elections demonstrated the unity and oneness within the Church in Plateau. He said this peace should be sustained by the new CAN Executive. “You should see your election as another affirmation of your calling in the Lord’s vineyard as you serve not only those of the Christian faith, but the society at large. “You should always remember that the society today is in need of love, healing, truth and justice. Use your new offices to propagate these and other tenets of Christianity,” he said. Lalong also advised the new CAN leadership to work toward strengthening unity among different denominations and reaching out to people of other faiths, to foster understanding, tolerance and peaceful coexistence. He assured the chairman and other executives that his administration would appreciate their counsel and prayers for God’s guidance in their discharge of duties. Lalong also thanked the outgoing CAN Chairman, Rev. Soja Bewarang and members of his executive committee for their support and prayers for the state and his administration.
