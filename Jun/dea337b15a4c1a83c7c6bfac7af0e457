Some Commissioners of police have also been tipped for elevation to AIG to fill up the vacancies occasioned by the creation of new zonal commands by President Muhammadu Buhari. Also, 36 deputy commissioners of Police have been tipped for elevation to Commissioners of Police. Attempt to speak with the spokesman of the Police Service Commission (PSC) was unsuccessful as his phone was switched off. However, a top official in PSC who confided in The Guardian noted that such proposal was on the table but has not been finalized. “No one can tell you anything concrete until tomorrow when the PSC Commissioners must have concluded their plenary. I can tell you there was a proposal for such, but it has not been concluded. “Remember the PSC chairman lost his wife, so everything is on hold. We would be able to tell you something after tomorrow’s sitting of the Commission. But there was such proposal,” the source said.
