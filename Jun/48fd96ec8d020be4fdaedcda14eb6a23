IMF chief economist Gita Gopinath said under current forecasts, the crisis will destroy $12 trillion over two years, and cautioned, “we are not out of the woods.”  She warned governments against withdrawing the stimulus too quickly.

The fund “will help address Myanmar’s urgent financing needs related to COVID-19 shock, and catalyze support from development partners.” The money comes from two programs put into place to ensure rapid disbursement of funding without the need for lengthy negotiations over a reform program by Myanmar. Some $118.8 million will come from the Rapid Credit Facility and the remaining $237.7 million will draw from the Rapid Financing Instrument. It was the 72nd request for emergency financial assistance approved by the fund’s executive board to address the impact of the pandemic. The funding will help Myanmar’s government as it boosts health spending, expands food distribution and cash transfer programs to the most vulnerable, as well as businesses and farmers, the IMF said.
