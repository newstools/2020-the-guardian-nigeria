One of the key leaders in the Black Lives Matter movement, Opal Tometi has just released her breath-taking visuals for “Beyond African Liberation Day”. In the short video footage, shot by acclaimed filmmaker Wael Gozly, we are given an image of Opal in Accra, Ghana for the Year of Return festivities in early 2020. This message is a celebration of African Liberation Day (May 25, 1963) which highlights African-Unity which was founded on freedom,
sacrifice, and activism. This movement was a signal for progress and liberation from the people of Africa and around the world. Speaking reflectively on the meaning of African Liberation Day and the ongoing efforts of social justice movements, which are an ever-present necessity following recent events of further social inequalities against the African-American community, Opal once again uses her voice to remind us of the courage, effort and resilience displayed by the black community.  Speaking of her inspiration to inspire change, Opal states: “There was a time when my uncle was in an immigration detention center, and members of our community would take turns visiting him each weekend. That instilled in me the value of taking care of each other even if the systems aren’t working in your favor.” (Time Magazine) “I have always felt like I want to change the course of history. I was in awe of previous Black
liberation struggle leaders” (Taken from an article in Time Magazine)
