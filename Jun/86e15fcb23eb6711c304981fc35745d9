The All progressives Congress (APC) says the decision by Governor Godwin Obaseki to defect to the opposition People’s Democratic Party (PDP) did not come to it as a surprising development. Spokesperson of the APC, Malam Lanre Issa-Onilu gave the reaction while speaking with journalists in Abuja. “It has not come to us as a surprise. We knew he had defected long ago because he resigned his membership of the party which we have accepted,” Issa-Onilu said. “So you can’t defect twice. So if he is defecting again, we don’t know whether what he has just done now is news any longer.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
