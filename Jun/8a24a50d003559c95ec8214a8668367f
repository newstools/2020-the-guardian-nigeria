Peruzzi responds to rape allegations Nigerian singer-songwriter Tobechukwu Victor Okoh better known as Peruzzi has denied the rape allegations made against him by a twitter user. A twitter user identified as Princess Jayamah on Wednesday, June 3, 2020,  accused  Peruzzi of raping her. According to the lady, the “Only One” singer raped her about eight years ago when she accompanied a friend to his house in Lagos. Peruzzi has now refuted the claims made by Princess Jayamah according to a statement released on his Instagram page. “I have never and will never rape or sexually assault anybody. The claim is false and has also been refuted by a witness who was present at the time of the allegation.” Peruzzi response to rape allegations | Image: Instagram/peruzzi_vibes Following the accusations by Jayamah, twitter users dug up old tweets in which the singer endorsed rape as well as called himself a rapist. In one of those tweets, Peruzzi wrote: “MAKE I CALL BUKKY SAY I WAN CHOP..MAKE SHE TALK ANYHOW FIRST…I GO RAPE AM”. In another tweet from 2012, he wrote: “We plan to go c a movie,n u bring 6 oda babes, iPay, buy chao after movie, take u sumwere else, call 6 of my guys, we rape all of you. Na bad.” In his recent statement, Peruzzi apologised for the “stupid” tweets and admitted that he was naive at the time he made them and thereby did not know the implications: “I’m ashamed and deeply apologetic for a series of tweets posted on social media 8 years ago. Those tweets were irresponsible and ill-informed. I was younger and didn’t fully grasp the implications of making such statements. They are neither a reflection of who I am then, or now. “I can’t forgive myself for those dumb tweets. I am sorry. That’s not me!” the singer said in a tweet following the press release. [Ad unit=2]
