The technical crew of the Super Eagles of Nigeria has admitted newly appointed assistant coach of the team, Joseph Yobo, into its fold. The Media Officer of the team, Toyin Ibitoye, confirmed the development in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Monday. Ibitoye said the former captain of the team was admitted into the crew during a meeting via video conferencing on Sunday. “Joseph Yobo was welcomed officially to the team at the meeting. “The scouts and assistant coaches were able to provide the head coach with information about all our players in Europe and draw up a plan to keeping monitoring them,” Ibitoye said. He said this was the first meeting since Gernot Rohr was handed a contract extension, adding that this offered him the opportunity to enforce his philosophy and the need for the team to stay focused and hungry for greater success. NAN reports that Nigeria re-signed Rohr to a new two-year contract extension in May that would see the German finish as the longest-serving coach in Super Eagles history by the end of his tenure. NAN also reports that those that took part in the video conferencing alongside the head coach and Yobo included Nabil Trabelsi, video analyst and Jean Luc Royer, fitness coach. Others were Tunde Adelakun, chief scout; Alloy Agu, goalkeeper coach; Ibrahim Gyaran, team doctor and Anaemeka Anozie, team physiotherapist.
