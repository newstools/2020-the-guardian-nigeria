The United Nations (UN) Humanitarian Coordinator in Nigeria, Edward Kallon, has condemned non-state armed groups’ massacre in Faduma Kolomdi community of Borno State. The herding community, located 120 kilometres north of Maiduguri, the state capital, was attacked on Tuesday by Boko Haram. In a statement, on Friday, in Maiduguri, Kallon said: “I am outraged and incensed by incoming reports of violent incidents against civilians, carried out by non-state armed groups in Borno State. Eighty-one civilians were ruthlessly killed and many others wounded in an attack that lasted for over six hours on Tuesday night and Wednesday morning.” “On the afternoon of June 9, 2020, armed actors aboard motorcycles mounted a brutal attack on Felo community in Gubio Local Council, 80 kilometres away from the state capital, Maiduguri. “I am also receiving worrying reports that civilians were shot while trying to escape and that assailants set ablaze homes with civilians still inside. They stole more than 1,000 heads of cattle.” “I am also troubled by the widespread practice by non-state armed groups of setting up illegal checkpoints along main supply routes. “I urge all actors on the ground to protect civilians and aid workers, and ensure unimpeded delivery of humanitarian aid to the most vulnerable women, children and men, who desperately need relief.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
