To enhance checks on the importation of fake and substandard products into Nigeria in line with established protocols, plans are underway to operationalise the National Single Window (NSW) project as well as deploy scanners at the nation’s seaports before year-end.
   
The Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Adeniyi Adebayo, stated this at an investigative hearing on the incessant influx of fake, substandard and counterfeit products into Nigeria, organized by the House of Representatives Joint Committee on Commerce; Industry; Information; National Orientation; Ethics and Values. 
   
The Minister said there is an implementation committee at work, of which he is a member, to ensure the single window and scanners are deployed appropriately.  With the Single Window, port community portal and functional scanners at the ports, PEBEC aims to ensure that save the exception of the lead agencies – Nigerian Customs Service, Nigerian Ports Authority and Nigerian Police Force, there will be little or no need for routine physical examination of cargo by additional agencies at the ports.
