Taking to his Instagram on Monday, the actor said to his fans: This my kid. One of the happiest, well-adjusted individuals I’ve ever known. My son, Karter. Karter with a K because it reminded him of my name. He chose it. You see, he was born female but has always identified as a boy. He thought it would be cool if I announced it on social media. I told him there would be a lot of supporters as well as jerks who would be harsh. ‘Yeah, I know about trolls dad, I can handle trolls. Man, there is nothing more beautiful than watching your child feel the joy of exploring what it means to be true to themselves. This is his journey, and I am here for it. I hope you all have the opportunity to feel the unquenchable love that I am feeling right now. Payton, 48, wrote the caption alongside a picture of his son who looked to be skateboarding, as he was wearing a helmet, elbow pads, and wrist guard. Sometimes in March last year, Payton’s wife, Stacy Reed Payton, filed for divorce from the actor after nine years of marriage. They have two children together, 11-year-old son Karter and 8-year-old daughter Maya. Payton’s post came the same day that the Supreme Court in the US announced a major victory to the LGBTQ+ community, with a landmark civil rights ruling that is set to protect gay and trans people from workplace discrimination. Khary Payton is an American actor and voice actor, best known for his voice role of the DC Comics character Cyborg across various films, cartoons, and video games.
