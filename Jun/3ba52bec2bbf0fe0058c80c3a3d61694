The maiden edition of the 2020 MGI International Scrabble Classics earlier slated to take place in September have been postponed till next year due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, the organisers have announced. The scrabble championship, which has elicited interest from many of the top players around the world, is rated as one of the big competitions in the country this year. Nigeria is the current world number one nation in scrabble. Speaking on the competition, MGI Scrabble League organiser, Lukman Owolabi, also disclosed that the Week Three of the competition billed to hold on July 18 in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, has been postponed, saying a new date for the league would be announced on August 31. “We are hoping there will still be a chance to complete the 2020 Scrabble league season before the end of the year. This is provided the safety and well-being of players will not be compromised in any way or form. “Such possibility will also be dependent on authorities lifting restrictions on public gatherings and inter-state travels. As much as we all want to be back on the scrabble board face to face, it is imperative we do it at the right time and not at the detriment of our health. “We want to use this opportunity to reiterate that MGI events will be back on the calendar only when it is SAFE to do so,” he said.
