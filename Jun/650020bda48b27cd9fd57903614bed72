 Inoyo  Interestingly, the year 2013 was very key to this annual sports programme in our State.  A certain Aniekeme Alphonsus of Community Secondary School, Ikot Abia Idem, Ikot Ekpene, emerged overall best athlete with three golds in 100, 200, 4×100 girls. That same year, Mobil Producing approved the taking of the winners to Calabar for a two-week holiday training programme and invited the best coaches in the nation including, Amelia Edet, Solomon Abari, Onuagaluchi Kerechukwu, Sule Oluyomi, Gabriel Okon, Stephen Nuhu, Utitofon Uko-Nkantah, Obajimi Lucas, etc. They were all recruited to help train and raise Akwa Ibom talented youths to fame and prominence in sports. The impact was wonderful, as Akwa Ibom State left the Calabar camp for the 1st Nigeria Junior Sports Festival in Abuja and won the Athletics event with six gold, five silver and seven bronze medals.
