Ghanaian President Nana Akufo-Addo on Tuesday  apologised to Nigeria’s president Muhammadu Buhari for the demolition of a building on the premises of Nigerian High Commission in Accra, Ghana. “In a telephone call, the Ghanaian leader told President Buhari that he has directed full investigation into the incident,” President Buhari’s spokesman, Garba Shehu, said on Twitter on Tuesday. Ghanaian-based JoyNews had reported that armed men stormed the Nigerian High Commissioner’ residence in Accra with bulldozers to demolish a block of apartments in the diplomatic building on Friday night. The building which was still undergoing construction was being built to house staff and visiting diplomats to the Nigeria High Commission in Ghana. JoyNews editor Fred Smith said the armed men threatened to shoot staff of the Nigerian embassy who were present at the scene if they interfere in their operations. According to the head of security at the High Commission Emmanuel Kabutey, the leader of the team that came to demolish the building told them that they had the backing of National Security and that “if any of us try, he will clear us off.” Insistent that the demolition being backed by authorities in the Ghanaian Government, Kabutey complained about the lacklustre attitude of the police in handling the situation. Shehu, however, stated that some suspects have been arrested, and will be arraigned in court.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
