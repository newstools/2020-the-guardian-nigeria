 Coach Godwin Izilien wants the NFF to employ indigenous coaches for the Super Falcons.  Izilien wondered why the NFF would be going for a foreign coach when Nigerian coaches had been successful with the team in different competitions over the years. He also tasked the NFF to get a local coach for the women’s team as soon as possible, stressing that the delay in appointing a manager for the Super Falcons would affect the progress and building process of the team. “I don’t know why the NFF is still focused on getting a foreign coach for the Super Falcons. We have quality coaches in Nigeria that can build the team. Spending money to hire a foreign coach during this COVID-19 period, that the economy is not friendly is not necessary. “If a domestic coach had abandoned the Falcons the way the foreign coach did, the NFF would have been working towards arresting and prosecuting the coach. “There are good coaches experienced enough to lead the Falcons. As for me, I cannot apply for Falcons job after my experience with the team. “Winning a gold medal in South Africa 2014 Africa Women Championship with my team scoring goals and conceding less throughout the championship is a great achievement for me. But if I am called to assist in any capacity, I will oblige. Nigeria is my country,” he said  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
