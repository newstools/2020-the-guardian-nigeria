Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) has seized a multi-million naira property belonging to Bauchi State Governor Bala Mohammed, who was minister of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). ICPC spokesperson, Rasheedat Okoduwa, who disclosed this yesterday in Abuja, added that the action was pursuant to the commission’s powers contained in Section 45 (4) (a-c) of the Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Act, 2000. According to Okoduwa, the property, which houses Zinaria International School, is located at Plot 298, Wuye District, Cadastral Zone B3, Abuja. She explained: “ICPC’s intelligence-led investigation revealed that Mohammed in his official capacity as the FCT minister, had allocated the said property to a school that had himself and family members as directors and shareholders, despite an existing right of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture over the land. “To this end, the commission will issue notices of seizure and shall cause them to be served on the appropriate land registry, ministry and department where the property is situated as required by law. “Mohammed had earlier been charged for using his office to confer a corrupt advantage upon himself and relations under Section 19 of ICPC law, but could not be arraigned before he was sworn in as governor of Bauchi State.” Following the notice of seizure, the commission, The Guardian gathered, will apply for an order of forfeiture under Section 48 of the ICPC Act in line with the Federal Government Policy focusing on the recovery of proceeds of crime, pending the expiration of Mohammed’s tenure as governor.
