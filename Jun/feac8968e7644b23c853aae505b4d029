Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike has revealed that the Real Madrid Football Academy in the state would be completed in August and start full academic activities in September. The new deadline was predicated on the fact that the contractors claimed to have lost  28 days because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Wike extended the completion date when he visited the project site at the Yakubu Gowon Stadium in Elekahia,  Port Harcourt, to inspect the extent of work done. The governor emphasised that the contractors would have no reason to delay completion of the project beyond August 2020 because the government would fulfil its financial obligation. Wike noted that the pitches and the administrative offices were ready, adding that the academy would not commence activities if the hostels and classrooms were not ready. He said combining academic activities with football training would give Rivers youths admitted into the institution a more holistic career path.
 Speaking on behalf of the contractor, Project Manager, SPG Construction Nig. Ltd, Mr. Julien Kan, assured the governor that the project would be delivered on schedule.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
