The Monkey is known as Kalua and was formerly the pet of an occultist who fed him hard liquor at his home in Mirzapur, Uttar Pradesh. However, after its owner died, the bereft animal stopped getting its supply of spirits and began prowling the streets in a furious rage. It targeted women and girls in particular, with dozens of children left needing plastic surgery after it ripped open their faces with his fangs. One of its victims died from the attack. The animal has since been caught and will now be kept in captivity for the rest of its life. The six-year-old monkey was eventually captured and hauled into Kanpur Zoo where zoologists discovered that it was not only an alcoholic but that he refused to eat vegetables. The scientists believe that the occultist must have also fed the monkey meat, another possible cause for its indefatigable anger. It was also noted that the monkey had a propensity for attacking female zookeepers and would also attack other monkeys if put in the same cage. It has therefore been decided that Kalua will remain locked in a cage at the zoo for the rest of his days.
