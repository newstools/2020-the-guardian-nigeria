He said the pilots had been discussing the coronavirus pandemic as they attempted to land the Airbus A320. “The pilot and co-pilot were not focused and throughout the conversation was about coronavirus,” Khan said. The Pakistani investigation team, which included officials from the French government and the aviation industry, analysed data and voice recorders. The minister said the plane was “100 percent fit for flying, there was no technical fault”. The county’s deadliest aviation accident in eight years came days after domestic commercial flights resumed following a two-month coronavirus lockdown. Many passengers were on their way to spend the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr with loved ones. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
