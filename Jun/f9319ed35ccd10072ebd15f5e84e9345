• As Service blames service providers Operations of importers and clearing agents at the Tin-Can Island `Port, in Lagos, are being frustrated following the collapse of the Nigeria Customs Integration System (NICIS2) server in the past fortnight. The server failure, which has crippled business activities at the Port, has led to high demurrage and storage charges for importers, as documentation for Customs clearance by clearing agents have become tedious.
 
The Tin-Can Island Port is the second busiest seaport in Nigeria after Apapa. The port has five terminal operators with different concession agreements.
   
Under the NICIS 2 platform, importers and clearing agents are expected to process their clearance documents from the comfort of their homes and offices, to reduce overcrowding into the ports and various Customs commands.  Public Relations Officer of the Command, Uche Ejesieme, confirmed the server failure even as he said that the Customs server was being managed by Webfontaine in partnership with Interswitch – technical partners to the NCS.
   
Ejesieme noted that the Command is also losing revenue to the server failure, and therefore more worried about the development than the operators.
Ejesieme said: “On the issue of server failure, kindly note that the technical hitches are usually being handled by Webfontaine in partnership with Interswitch. They were contracted by government to provide technical assistance for our NICIS2 operations.
   
“We have a good working relationship with the technical providers to the extent that once we receive reports from stakeholders about difficulties in their e-transaction; we immediately get in touch with the technical team for resolution.
   
“Don’t also forget that each time there is server failure, it also affects our revenue, and so we are even more worried than the stakeholders. While we regret the inconvenience which the situation may have caused all of us, I would like to assure everyone that the situation is being handled by the technical team.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
