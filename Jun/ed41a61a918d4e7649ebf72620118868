Members of Public Transport Owners of Nigeria Association (PTONA), have lamented the loss of about N200 billion following the 12-week ban on inter-state travels by the Federal Government.
 
Indeed, the Association also decried additional loss of about 400 human lives, and another 35 per cent recorded cases of now collapsed businesses due to the ban. President of PTONA, Isaac Uhunmwagho, who gave the figures at a press conference in Lagos, pleaded that the ban on inter- state transportation be lifted as soon as possible.
 
According to Uhunmwagho, the issue of ban on inter-state transportation is something that affects everyone, and called on the government to come to the aid of the transportation industry.
   
The President informed that PTONA had already written their plea for financial assistance and palliatives to the Economic Sustainability Committee (ESC), headed by Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osibanjo.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
