For fear of being suspected to have contracted Coronavirus, malaria patients, especially those living in rural areas of Taraba State, have stopped accessing health facilities. Also, the inability of relevant authorities to equip health workers, who have not come in contact with COVID-19 cases, with adequate Personal Protection Equipment (PPEs), have had negative effect on malaria intervention. The leadership of the Civil Society in Malaria Control, Immunisation and Nutrition (ACCOMIN), yesterday, made the observations during the state media briefing on Global Fund Malaria Accountable and Advocacy Project, which took place in Jalingo. Led by its Programme Manager,  Gofwen Wubunna Ishaku,  the group advocated adequate supplies of PPEs to health workers, training and retraining, as this would change the mindset of the staff towards malaria patients willing to access health facilities. He urged government, at all levels, to intervene by increasing funds for malaria intervention. He said dilapidated structures and ill-equipped facilities also attributed to why patients were dragging their feet, and emphasised the need for the structures to be renovated and well-equipped, for the fight against malaria to be effective. Also, the Chairman of the organisation, Alhaji Mohammed Danburam, said for the fight against malaria to be achieved, all hands must be on deck.  He called on the media to join in the fight.
