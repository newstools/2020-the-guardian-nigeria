Lagos State Chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has charged the Governor’s Advisory Council (GAC) of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and former governor of the state, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, who is also the leader and founder of the council, to be courageous enough to proscribe all militant and extortionist groups being used to achieve selfish political motive in the state. In a statement yesterday through its state’s Publicity Secretary, Mr. Taofik Gani, the PDP, while reacting to the recent banning of all groupings in Lagos APC by the GAC after a meeting last week, described the ban as an admission of a long-standing error, which had indeed stalled development in Lagos State over the years. The PDP added that the belated ban was not even in the consideration of the state “but because of the political ambitions of the APC chieftains.”
It also accused the ruling party of running other groupings, which have also contributed to the grossly mal-administered and unsafe Lagos State. According to the PDP, “Such groupings and others secretly operating have been long-term clogs in the wheels of development of the state.“Those groups are in the forefront of collecting free Lagos funds, abandoning development projects, diverting palliatives meant for the vulnerable, imposing very mediocre incompetent office holders, attacking and coercing opposition interests in all walks of life. Citizens of the state will always remember the APC allegations against the immediate past governor, Mr. Akinwunmi Ambode, that he stopped the funding of their chieftains and party. Hence, they went ahead to deny him (Ambode) a second term.” The PDP, however, boasted that it would defeat APC in the next governorship poll.
