Nigeria Police Force have arrested the suspect linked to murder of University of Benin student Vera Omozuwa. According to the spokesman of Edo Police Command, Chidi Nwabuzor, the suspect was arrested after the fingerprint on the fire extinguisher she was attacked with was examined. Omozuwa was attacked while studying inside the church of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, in Benin city, according to Nigerian police. The 22-year-old university student was taken to hospital where doctors battled to save her, but Omozuwa died three days later, the church spokesman Olaitan Olubiyi said. Police spokesman described Omozuwa’s death as a “brutal attack” in a statement and said the force would “bring the perpetrators of the callous act to book in the shortest possible time.” Olubiyi said Omozuwa was a member of the choir who had studied privately at the church since lockdown measures due to the coronavirus pandemic were put in place in Nigeria in March. “We are all devastated by her death. She decided to do some private studies during the lockdown because the church was peaceful. She’s been taking the key from the parish pastor and returning it after her studies. “But that day she didn’t return it and the night guard who resumed duty found her in a pool of her own blood and half-naked in the church hall,” Olubiyi added.
