Oyo State Commissioner for Youth and Sports, Seun Fakorede has tested positive for coronavirus. “I tested positive for COVID-19 and I want you to know that there’s no cause for any panic as I’m very well, safe and sound without any symptoms/breakdown,” Fakorode, who’s the youngest cabinet member in Oyo State, tweeted on Friday. “Before the test result came in, I had no inkling that I was going to test positive. This was because, despite the demands of the office I occupy, I have been careful since COVID-19 crept into our world — I took the test just like others and didn’t nurse any fear. “I was asymptomatic, I still am, and I remain fearless. “I have immediately followed and adhered strictly to the directives of the Incident Management for the Oyo State Response to the Coronavirus Pandemic. “COVID-19 is not in anyway a death sentence — So, while I acknowledge my Principal, Governor Seyi Makinde, for the efforts he has put in place to tackle the pandemic, I want to further urge us all to continue to do everything to minimize the spread of this virus. “I will remain in isolation till I fully recover, I will fight this, victoriously — please continue to comply with all the directives of the COVID-19 Task Force. Stay safe!” His result is coming less than 24 hours after ex-Governor of the state, Abiola Ajimobi died of COVID-19 in a private hospital in Lagos. The state governor Seyi Makinde had also tested for the virus but he recovered days after.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
