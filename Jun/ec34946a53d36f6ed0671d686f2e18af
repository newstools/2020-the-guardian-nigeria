A business mogul and philanthropist, Valentine Ozigbo has said that democracy has come to stay in Nigeria and called on the citizens to deepen their engagement and investment in its preservation in the country. Ozigbo, in a statement on Friday to mark the democracy day celebration, also called on leaders at all levels to take a  second look at the various calls for the restructuring of the country’s economic model to create a more inclusive economy that could work for every Nigerian irrespective of tribe, gender, or religion. He, however, acknowledged certain imperfections in democratic practices in the country but quickly added that certain aspects of it ought to be celebrated by all and sundry. He said: “As we celebrate another year in this democratic journey, it is only proper that we take a moment to ponder on our recent past, evaluate the present, and strategize on the future of our dear country. “In several ways, and on several fronts, we have overcome adversities and challenges. We have come out of these challenges stronger and determined to build a secure, stable, equitable, prosperous, and democratic Nigeria”, he said Ozigbo, who is the immediate past President and CEO of Transcorp Plc, also urged Nigerians to “look and think deeply” towards rebuilding “our nation community by community”. He noted that one of the biggest challenges facing the country presently was the economic injustice which according to him was “threatening the foundation of our existence as one country”. Calling for leaders to take another look on calls for restructuring to create a more conducive economy, he stated “That would be one right step in forging a strong, indivisible nation based on equity, fairness, and justice” Ozigbo, who is the founder of Chineto Ozigbo Foundation, a philanthropic endeavour that has provided social, community, and youth development interventions in Anambra State, said he decided to resign from Transcorp to focus on a career in public service.
