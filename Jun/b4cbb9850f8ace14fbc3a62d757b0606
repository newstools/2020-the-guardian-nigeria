The singer featured Davido in one of the tracks “Wonder”. In a recent interview, he talks about his experience working with the “Assurance” hitmaker and his impact on the song “Wonder”. In his words: Davido is so talented. He listened to the song and knew the exact and perfect bounce and vibe. The delivery was top notch. I don’t need to say much, just listen to the song make you see “Cruise”. Big shout out to OBO for coming through for me. Video coming soon. Watch out. I dropped “Wonder” in 2019 and it was amazing and my label, Tycoon Entertainment thought that Davido would be amazing on the remix. So, we hit him up and he loved it and jumped on it and we made a classic. His verse was amazing and since the release of the song this morning (June 11, 2020) everyone has been on it and it’s trending right now. I’m excited and grateful. Since Evih signed a record deal with Tycoon Entertainment in 2017, things have been turning out great for the singer. He started music professionally in 2015, things took flight for him under the wings of Tycoon Entertainment. Speaking about his journey with the record label, he said: I signed a record deal with Tycoon Entertainment in 2017 and since then everything has been amazing and beautiful. I never had a better year than last year. I recorded my first ever single “For You” in 2015. I dropped a couple of mixtapes in 2017 before signing with Tycoon Entertainment. I have already shot two videos under the label and this is my first project, the “Cruise” EP. They are willing to push and see my growth and when the cake is sliced everyone gets bread. God bless Tycoon Entertainment. Shout out to everyone. He further expressed how confident he is in his new EP. He stated his certainty about the success of the EP. He said he seeks to achieve nothing but happiness with “Cruise” EP. “Cruise” was made to bring happiness and joy to people’s hearts, loved ones, and family during and after lockdown. You know when you are in a boat or ship at the ocean and you on “Cruise”. The best feeling is when holding the edge of the ship and looking into the sea and the beauty of nature with the soothing breeze blowing your hair backward. The way you feel is the dream I have for The EP “Cruise” when people listen to it. I hope they feel like that. My EP is all about “Cruise”. Happiness is a choice. Choose it.
