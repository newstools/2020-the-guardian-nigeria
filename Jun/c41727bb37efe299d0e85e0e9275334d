The talented designer has also taken to Instagram to share the news. Kanye shared the news about the Gap partnership on Friday, hashtagging his announcement #WESTDAYEVER. The Yeezy Gap line’s anticipated 2021 launch will include men, women, and kids pieces. Ye’s deal is for 10 years, with a choice to renew after five years. The new clothing line will be introduced in the first half of 2021, the companies said on Friday. Yeezy’s design studio, under Kanye West’s creative direction, plans to create “modern, elevated basics for men, women, and kids at accessible price points.” Ogunlesi previously attended Central Saint Martins and had her London Fashion Week debut in 2019, where her aesthetic was typified by leather, cutout tops, and vibrant patterns. She has in the past, worked with Kelela, Steve Lacy, and Solange, and collaborated with Skepta on his “Pure Water” music video. Her fashion history can be traced to both of her parents who are also fashion designers. Also, her Scottish grandmother falls into the same category. She moved to Nigeria in the 1960s after marrying Ogunlesi’s grandfather and launched a fashion label that used textiles produced locally. Even though Ogunlesi was not brought up in Nigeria, she maintained a close affinity with the country and this serves as a form of inspiration for her designs. Kanye West has been making waves since he joined the fashion industry. He has successfully worked since 2013 with Adidas, where his brand is positioned as its own category and he earns royalties on net sales of his shoes and apparel according to The New York Times. Also, Yeezy shoes, which can cost hundreds of dollars and even more on secondary markets, were expected to top $1.3 billion in sales last year.
