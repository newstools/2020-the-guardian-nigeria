The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has described the claim by Gov. Yahaya Bello of Kogi, that some PDP governors were planning to defect to All Progressives Congress (APC), as childish, laughable and pathetic. The party in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Mr Kola Ologbondiyan,  on Saturday in Abuja said nobody could take such “peddling of falsehood” seriously. Ologbondiyan described Bello’s claim as a desperate attempt to divert public attention from the imminent exodus from the APC. “Moreover, Gov. Bello has no relationship of any sorts with any governor elected on the platform of the PDP, ” he said. Ologbondiyan said that nobody abandoned a cruising liner, which the PDP represents, to jump into the APC.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
