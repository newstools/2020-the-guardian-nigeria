• Nigeria has no reason to fail to win AFCON, qualify for World Cup
Youth and Sports Development Minister, Sunday Dare, has reminded Super Eagles Coach, Gernot Rohr that Nigerians expect much from him following the new contract he got recently from the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF). The minister, who said he was not averse to the contract extension, insisted that Nigerians must get results if the German coach must stay as the country’s head football coach. Speaking at the weekend, Dare said: “The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) is statutorily in charge of the growth and development of football in Nigeria; of course under the supervision of the Ministry of Youth and Sports. Even before I became minister, there were processes and procedures that were followed to bring on a new national coach or renew the contract of a coach, who is already in the house and I think it was important for us to follow the processes and procedures in place. “For Rohr, because he had been signed on earlier, he deserved to be given the right of first refusal, that was what the NFF did and that was what I also allowed to happen. It is best practice, it is global practice, but the NFF also had a review of his performance in the last three to four years and based on that review, his new contract had new conditions that never existed before. Some of them bordering on mode of payment, some of them bordering on technical issues regarding the development of our football and that to me, is fundamental.” Dare warned that it would not be business as usual, insisting that the coach would be held to a higher depth of responsibility, where he could have his contract reviewed if he fell short of the direction outlined in the terms of his contract. Also speaking on Rohr’s new deal at the weekend, former Super Eagles Assistant Coach, Joe Erico, said the target the NFF set for Rohr, including to win the Cameroun 2021 Africa Nations Cup, is attainable if the team worked hard for it. Erico said Rohr now has the best opportunity to assemble a formidable squad that will not only win the Nations cup, but excel at the Qatar 2022 World Cup, adding that the only way that could be possible if by picking the best Nigerian players for matches without sentiments and interference from any quarter. He argued that Rohr German has enough pool of talents to build one of the best teams in the world, adding, “I am delighted that he has renewed his contract because it gives him the chance to build on the foundation he has already laid for the team.” Erico added: “I believe Rohr must have really reflected on his past performance with the Super Eagles before he accepted the target given to him by the NFF to win next year AFCON and also do well at the Qatar 2022 World Cup. “Rohr is in a better place to excel to any level with Super Eagles at this moment based on the abundant young talents within and outside the country aspiring to play for the Eagles. “When Rohr was dropping and selecting players in different games to get the best for the Super Eagles, some people castigated him that he did not have a team yet. This is not right because Rohr is close to the team and if dropping and picking new players for particular positions works for him, there is no need to attack him. “The NFF and football loving Nigerians should give Rohr the best support to succeed. He, in turn, should be focused to redeem Nigeria’s image in world football.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
