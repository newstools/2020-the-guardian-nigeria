The National Association of Resident Doctors (NARD) is to begin a nationwide strike next Monday. Its National President, Dr Aliyu Sokomba, made the disclosure in an official circular to members. According to him, the body found it necessary to “take this decision following the inability of the government to meet our demands upon the 14 days ultimatum duly given to the Federal Government for indefinite strike action.” He advised that alternative arrangements should be made to care for patients, as the “strike shall be total and indefinite. No service of any kind, be it emergency, care at COVID-19 isolation, and treatment centres shall be exempted.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
