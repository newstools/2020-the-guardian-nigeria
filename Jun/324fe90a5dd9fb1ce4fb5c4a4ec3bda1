RUPTURED BLADDER | NEW YORK POST According to multiple reports, a Chinese man suffered three bladder tears after drinking ten beers and holding his pee for 18 hours. It is gathered that the 40-year-old man identified only as Mr Hu reportedly consumed 10 beers during a night out in town and crashed into a deep sleep on his return home. He didn’t pee for a total of 18 hours and doctors explained this could be tied to alcohol’s capacity to suppress the nervous system. In a report published on June 18, doctors at Zhuji People’s Hospital in Zhejiang wrote that the patient had said that when he woke up from his sleep, he started experiencing sharp pain in his abdomen. He was rushed to the hospital in an ambulance and was in so much pain that he couldn’t even lie down. An emergency MRI quickly revealed the source of this excruciating pain – the man’s bladder had ruptured in three places. It was discovered that one of the tears had opened up towards his abdominal cavity and had caused one of his intestines to enter the bladder. This would have led to tissue death if left unfixed, so Hu was prepared for emergency surgery and a team of surgeons managed to repair the bladder, preventing other complications. Although now in a stable condition, doctors have warned that Mr Hu’s case is extremely rare, it could theoretically happen to anyone. It is recommended to pee regularly because even though the human bladder is flexible and can increase in size as fluids are consumed, it has limited capacity of around 450 to 500 milliliters. It is advisable to pee regularly especially when consuming lots of fluids. Alcohol makes one pee more often than if one was drinking the same quantity of water. However, in Hu’s case, the alcohol seems to have also suppressed the nervous system from conveying the need to empty the bladder to the brain.
