The decision by the Lagos State government to suspend indefinitely the planned re-opening of schools, places of worship and entertainment centres should be simply regarded as a judicious move in the light of the rising cases of the coronavirus disease. Despite pressure from various quarters persuading the state government to re-open schools and religious places, this bold pronouncement of the Lagos State government is a clear demonstration of authority and thoughtful leadership amid crisis. 
 
As new cases of the disease are being established and escalation detected with increased testing nationwide, other states of the federation should emulate the Lagos State government by maintaining the lockdown on schools, worship centres and schools where it is so, and effect a lockdown where schools and worship places have resumed activities.
 
Undoubtedly, the suspension of those social services in Lagos State is justified since Lagos has become the epicentre of the viral infection. With about 18,000 cases nationwide and Lagos carrying no fewer than 8,000 of such cases, it is instructive that utmost precaution be taken by the state government. Yet, it stands to reason that the overwhelming workload of health professionals and care-givers, the non-availability of testing centres and the gross violation of the COVID-19 protocols and indiscipline displayed by Nigerians, have made such an action imperative for other states of the federation.  With the benefit of hindsight, it is now clear that the initial plan for staggered classes for students was going to be a precarious adventure. Whilst we empathise with parents, students, proprietors that schools cannot resume as of yet, the government must not be put under any pressure to resume the usual academic activities. How could we have controlled and managed the interaction of students with peers and teachers? How ready would have been teachers and school workers to commit themselves to effect COVID-19 protocol? In simple precautions as washing with soap and water, how many schools would have been able to provide potable water let alone the provision of soaps? How would the ministries of education nationwide have coped? 
This same situation applies to churches, mosques and other religious places, many of whose leaders had criticised governments for locking down religious places whilst opening markets and working places.
 
Nigerians, government and all, should give thoughtful consideration to the unpredictable situation and overwhelming task befalling those at the front-line. In news reports, the chair of the Lagos State chapter of the Nigeria Medical Association COVID-19 task force, Dr. Japheth Olugbogi, was alleged to have stated that there were not enough testing going on. He blamed this on the lack of capacity in our healthcare system, the overwhelming work situation caused by the escalation in new cases, and the inaccessibility to testing by many others. Only a few days ago, the Nigeria Association of Resident Doctors (NARD) embarked on a nationwide industrial action over unfavourable working condition. Had students and teachers, congregation and worshippers been caught up in this, how would the country have managed the calamity?
