The Edo 2020 Sports Festival Committee set up to review Edo state readiness to host the event in the wake of the postponement due to the outbreak of COVID-19 has submitted its report to Youth and Sports Development Minister Mr. Sunday Dare. Speaking while submitting its report to the Minister in Abuja, Chairman of the Committee, Tonobok Okowa said the committee did a thorough job, which according to him would help the government decide on the best possible date to host the festival. Okowa, who is the chairman of Delta State Sports Commission, later told The Guardian that all submissions made by the committee were recommendations to help the Sports Ministry and the Federal Government on best possible ways to go about the hosting of the sports festival. Meanwhile, the Sports Minister has expressed his gratitude to the Committee for the speedy job saying: “Exactly a month ago, this committee was set up. I thank you for keeping to the schedule of your mandate. We shall study your report, sit down with relevant agencies of government to examine the recommendations there-in. The Ministry is properly guided by Covid-19 protocol and will not shy away from making decisions based on the reality on the ground.” Dare further said: “This is a milestone to determine when to start sporting activities, but we would not jeorpadise the health and wellbeing of our sportsmen and women.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
