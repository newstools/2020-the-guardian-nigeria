The Lagos State Waste Management Authority (LAWMA) highway sweepers have embarked on strike over non-payment of their three-month salaries. The sweepers also took to social media to protest the non-payment on Tuesday afternoon. A Twitter user, identified as Postsubman, noted that the sweepers, who worked all through the lockdown period, are yet to receive payment for the work done. He alleged that the Lagos State government decided to sack them despite non-payment of their salaries. In a video posted on Twitter, the sweepers were seen removing their uniforms and dumping them on the floor, which formed a huge pile. They said they got fed up and that the government should retrieve their uniforms.The LAWMA agency was yet to react to the protest as of the press time yesterday.
