The rapper spoke out about the late King of Pop in an interview with Pharrell Williams for the i-d magazine. In the chat, West expresses his admiration for Jackson and the way he lived his life and changed music, saying: Michael Jackson was doing covert, super gangsta stuff like he’d just pop the needles off. He kissed Elvis Presley’s daughter on MTV. Black culture used to be, we used to be fronting all night, but Michael was doing stuff that was different from what we were programmed to understand as being what we should do. He bought The Beatles’ back catalogue. That was Mike Jackson, right there. The hip-hop star went on to seemingly address the 2019 documentary Leaving Neverland, in which Jackson was accused of child sex abuse. In his words: We should have something that says we can’t allow any company to tear down our heroes. Not on The Shade Room [website], not on social media, and especially not in documentaries. He then went ahead to compare himself with Michael Jackson. He said: I’m like every time the media isn’t happy with me it’s like; Here they go. They’re gonna come and Wacko Jacko me.’ Which in some ways, they’ve tried to do. Wacko-Jacko is the nickname given to Jackson over his bizarre antics. In Leaving Neverland, Wade Robson and James Safechuck alleged Jackson had abused them from the ages of 10 and seven respectively after they were befriended by the King of Pop. The superstar, who was tried on child molestation charges and acquitted, died in 2009 at the age of 50. The controversy surrounding his relationship with young boys reignited with the broadcast of controversial Channel 4 documentary Leaving Neverland. The film featured allegations from Safechuck and Robson that they were both sexually abused by Jackson as youngsters. Michael Jackson’s family, however, denied all allegations and compared the allegations to a public lynching since the star is not alive to defend himself.
