Bowen University, Iwo, Osun State, a Baptist Convention institution has attributed the sacking of over 100 workers and attendant re-organisation to the adoption of a Modified Collegiate System.
 
Public Relations Officer of Bowen, Toba Adaramola, said in a statement that the decision became necessary due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, and had affected about eight to 10 per cent of the entire workforce, including the academic and non-academic staff.
 
“In 2018, it was discovered that the University is heading toward inflection point, and the management deliberated on the reasons for the inflection. It was discovered that the culture was part of the problem, hence, we embraced technology, and so many staffers were no longer needed to perform certain duties.
 
“Although, it is a painful decision, but one that is necessary to sustain the university since it is not a public institution that can rely on any subvention apart from the fees it charges the students,” he said.
 
In the disengagement letter of one of the top employees, The Guardian gathered that the university may consider the services should the economy improve, even as the decision is already generating tension on the campus, as some of the disengaged employees are threatening to protest.
