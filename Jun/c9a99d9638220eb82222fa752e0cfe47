The Nigeria Labour Congress NLC, Benue Chapter, has condemned the Benue government for failing to provide Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), for public sector workers resuming duties. In a telephone interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), on Wednesday in Makurdi, the NLC Chairman, Mr Godwin Anya, said that the state government had promised to provide face masks and hand sanitisers for the returning workers. Anya said that to the amazement of the workers, who resumed on Monday, none of the necessary things promised to prevent the spread of the virus was in place. The Chairman, however, commended the workers for resuming work as ordered by the government but advised them to make the necessary arrangements to protect themselves. “It is about their lives, so they should try and provide the face masks and hand sanitisers for themselves even if the government fails to keep to its promise”, Anya said.
