The animated film director, animation artist, and occasional voice actor was 60-years-old when he passed away on Friday. Kelly’s spokesperson Nancy Newhouse Porter of Newhouse Porter Hubbard confirmed the news, revealing he passed away at his home in Encino, California. She said: He was one of the most admired and beloved people in the industry. It’s heartbreaking for everyone. Kelly directed the 2004 film Shrek 2, featuring the voice work of Mike Myers and Cameron Diaz about trolls living in a fairy tale world. Kelly himself also provided “additional voices” in the hit cartoon comedy. His helming and voicing characters on Shrek 2 helped make the sequel a massive blockbuster, raking in $919.8 million on a $150 million budget, while garnering Oscar and Annie Award nominations. His other two Annie Award nominations came when he directed and co-wrote the animated fantasy-comedy Gnomeo & Juliet (2011) with Sir. Elton John. The versatile artist also provided the voices of the tiny Red Goon Gnomes in the film. The Texas-born director worked as a visual development artist on Disney’s The Little Mermaid in 1989, as an assistant art director on Tim Burton’s The Nightmare Before Christmas in 1993, and as a Story Artist on Disney’s Toy Story in 1995. Asbury also wrote a non-fiction book titled Dummy Days (2003), a biography that focused on 20th-century ventriloquists Jeff Dunham, Shari Lewis, Jimmy Nelson, Edgar Bergen, and Paul Winchell.
