The police have arrested 58-year-old Mallam Aminu Ado for allegedly impersonating the widow of Abba Kyari, former Chief of Staff (CoS) to President Muhammadu Buhari, to dupe the public. Ado, also known as Al Amin Yerima, whe was paraded by the Force Public Relations Officer (FPRO), DCP Frank Mba, in Abuja yesterday, intends to contest Kano State gubernatorial seat in 2023, The Guardian gathered. Mba said after the death of the former CoS, Ado started impersonating the widow, asking prominent Nigerians for donations to enable him organise special prayers for the soul of the deceased. “In the course of doing that, some of the prominent Nigerians became suspicious and reached out to us. He has been cooperative with the investigation and held back no facts. He is 58 years old. He had also had a stint with the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) in 2019. He was charged to an Abuja High Court and was convicted and imprisoned for three months as a result of the plea bargain successfully initiated by his lawyers,” Mba said. The FPRO said the suspect had an app on his phone that changed his voice to a woman’s, which he used to perpetuate the criminal act. But Ado claimed he was a family friend and was trying to organise a prayer for the soul of the departed, without the consent of the family. He however could not explain why he had to pretend to be a woman to solicit assistance. According to him, among those he contacted to solicit support were Governor Simon Lalong of Plateau State; House of Representatives Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila; and Minister of Information, Lai Mohammed.
