Enugu State isolation centre PHOTO: Twitter Enugu State government said it would soon discharge the six remaining cases of coronavirus still being treated at the various Isolation and treatment centres in the state, stressing that it was working hard to ensure zero casualties from the virus. Commissioner for health, Dr Ikechukwu Obi stated during the commissioning of permanent wash station donated to one of the Isolation centres in the state by the South Saharan Social Development Organization (SSDO) that patients were doing very well. He stated that five COVID-19 patients were discharged last week after they tested negative to the virus bringing the total to 13 cases that have so far been discharged in the state. Obi said that his ministry with the massive support of Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi “have continued to provide treatment for the existing cases, respond to emergency alerts as well as carry out contact tracing and follow up on suspects.” He described as “social media rumours” reports that certain persons have been declared wanted for their alleged contact with one of the cases of the virus in Igboetiti local government council of the state, stressing that, “we don’t declare patients wanted”. He urged all hands to be on deck to contain the spread of the virus, even as he commended the SSDO for the intervention, which he said would go a long way in supporting services at the Isolation centre. The permanent wash point was the number 10 in the state. SSDO’s Executive Director, Dr Stanley Ilechukwu, said the permanent wash station had been installed at the four isolation centres and six high volume markets in the state. He said that hand washing was a good measure to check the spread of the virus and encouraged people to always wash their hands, keep safe and ensure they observe the necessary hygiene at all times, irrespective of where they are.
