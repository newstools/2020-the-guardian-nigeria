The Lagos State police command has denied reports of a robbery incident at Ikoyi area of the state on Wednesday night.
 
The state police spokesman, Bala Elkana, in a statement made available to The Guardian said the speculation on the arrest of six armed robbery suspects in Ikoyi was untrue. 
 
He said: “The attention of Lagos State Police Command was drawn to a viral video and reports on social media claiming that there was a robbery incident in Ikoyi on June 17, and six armed robbers were arrested.
 
“The report is completely false, mischievous and misleading. What actually happened was that some LAWMA officials used their truck to block another vehicle that they earlier had misunderstanding with thereby causing gridlock.
