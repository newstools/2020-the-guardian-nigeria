4 Essential Morning Practices To Start Your Day With Image Neri The morning is the most important part of the day. It’s the beginning of your journey daily. The quality of your mornings will reflect in the day. If productivity is what you’re seeking, a thorough morning routine that includes healthy habits and effective planning is important. Below are some essential morning practices you can start your day with: Avoid Technology
If the first thing you do when you wake up is to check your smartphone for messages or work email, you are doing yourself a disservice. Instead, try remaining detached from technology for the first hour of your day so you can begin your day with present-moment awareness and a positive focus. Hydrate
Drinking a glass of water in the morning after going hours without a sip is a good way to hydrate your body. Also, if lemon is added to warm water and taken first thing in the morning, it removes toxins from your digestive tract that may have built up overnight. Exercise
Movement and nourishment are key to a healthy body, which in turn affects your overall wellbeing. Set aside time to do some exercise, this could be stretching, yoga or a workout to get your heart racing. Make sure to follow it with something to eat and plenty of water. Meditate
Incorporating some type of mindfulness practice like meditation into your daily morning routine can help ground and train your mind and emotions, which then influences how you react to challenges throughout your day. During your meditation, set your intention for the day. When you get clear on how you want your day to go, you can make clear decisions that create the life you truly want to live. Write down what you aim to achieve for the day and what steps you need to take. Your goals do not have to be large; it could be as simple as not allowing anyone to upset you on that day. Always start your day on a fresh note and work towards achieving your goal daily.
