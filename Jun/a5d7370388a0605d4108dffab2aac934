Medical doctors and other health workers in Rivers State have become apprehensive, as 22 doctors test positive for COVID-19. This was why the state chapter of the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) has implored the state government to provide the needed support for health workers. NMA chairperson, Obelebra Adebiyi, explained that besides the 22 doctors, about 60 other health workers have been infected by Coronavirus across the state. She regretted that doctors and other health workers battling lethal disease have had to grapple with inadequate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Concerned that the infection among medical health workers and doctors might spike further, she called on the state government to support medical practitioners to effectively tackle the pandemic. “The state has also recorded the death of a health worker, due to Coronavirus. This clearly calls for more action from the government, and private health facilities in the state, and indeed the general public,” she said. A doctor at the Rivers State University Teaching Hospital, who pleaded anonymity, said several doctors have become apprehensive, as there were inadequate PPE for them and complaints have not yielded much result.
