Nigeria’s Super Eagles striker Victor Osimhen has been named the best African player in the French League 1 for the 2019/2020 season. The Lille forward won the award after spending a season (not completed due to coronavirus outbreak). The 21-year old scored 18 goals and provided eight assists in all competitions for the French Ligue 1 side. Osimhen was picked ahead of his compatriot Moses Simon, Habib Diallo of Metz, Idrissa Gueye of Paris Saint Germain, Islam Slimani of Monaco, and Yunis Abdelhamid of Reims. The annual award is named after Marc-Vivien Foe, the late Cameroon and Olympique Lyonnais midfielder — twice an Africa Cup of Nations winner with the Indomitable Lions — who passed away on the field during the 2003 Confederations Cup. Osimhen in early June was named Lille’s player of the year. The stellar performances in his first season have linked him with a move away from the Les Dogues (The Mastiffs). Top European clubs – Liverpool, Napoli and Chelsea are reportedly hustling to sign Osimhen who was 2015 FIFA U-17 World Cup highest goal scorer to their ranks. Osimhen joined the Great Danes last summer from Sporting Charleroi after his impressive performances for the Belgian side, where he scored 19 league goals. The best African player of the Year Award is the third award Osimhen has won since teaming up with Christophe Galtier’s men. So far, Osimhen had won the Ligue 1 Player of the Month for October in 2019, Lille player of the Year Award and the best African player in the 2019/2020 season.
