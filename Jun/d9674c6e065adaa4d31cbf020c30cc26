Travellers’ apathy has welcomed long-distance international travels, as more foreign airlines resume operations globally.
 
The development is not unconnected with fears of coronavirus infections, the luxury of leisure travel during the recession, and tedious safety protocols like mandatory 14-day quarantine still in place at many destinations. 
 
The International Air Transport Association (IATA), however, urged governments to embrace the International Civil Aviation Organisation’s (ICAO) harmonised safety guidelines that include the use of face masks as a better alternative to quarantine and physical distancing onboard the airplane.  Connectivity within Africa will also expand, pending government’s approval, with the resumption of service from New York-JFK to Accra, as well as service from Atlanta to Lagos.
 
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines will further expand its route network in July. Compared to June, the number of flights will increase by more than 60 per cent. KLM will operate 25 to 30 per cent of the normal number of flights.
 
IATA’s Director General and Chief Executive Officer, Alexandre de Juniac, said the slow restart was anything but a normal situation for airline planning or passenger demand.
 
He said the public sentiment had seen “a significant shift from April 2020 when 61 per cent said that they would return to travel within a few months of the pandemic subsiding, and 21 per cent responded that they would wait about six months.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
