Robert S. Trump, the president’s younger brother, asked a court in the New York borough of Queens to block the book’s publication, alleging that Mary Trump was violating a nondisclosure agreement related to the settlement of the estate of Fred Trump, her grandfather — and Donald Trump’s father. “Her attempt to sensationalize and mischaracterize our family relationship after all of these years for her own financial gain is both a travesty and injustice to the memory of… our beloved parents,” Robert S. Trump said in a statement cited by the newspaper. “I and the rest of my entire family are so proud of my wonderful brother, the president, and feel that Mary’s actions are truly a disgrace,” he said in the statement. According to Simon & Schuster, the memoir “shines a bright light on the dark history” of the president’s family. The 240-page book will detail events Mary Trump witnessed as a child while spending time at her grandparents’ house in Queens, where her uncle and his four siblings grew up. “She describes a nightmare of traumas, destructive relationships and a tragic combination of neglect and abuse,” Simon & Schuster said in a blurb about the book. According to the news site Daily Beast, Mary Trump is also expected to reveal that she is the main source in a major investigation conducted by The New York Times into Donald Trump’s finances.
