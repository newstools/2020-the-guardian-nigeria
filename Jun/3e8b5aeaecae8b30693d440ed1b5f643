Most Nigerians may not be aware of government’s exports of electricity to some West African countries. As a matter of fact, many can swear that the government will not engage in such an export given the poor state of electricity across the country. The reality, however, is that the government of Nigeria has some international customers that import electricity from the country. According to Nigeria Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC), the country exports electricity to the Republics of Benin, Niger and Togo, Nigeria’s neighbours.
 
Ordinarily, there is nothing wrong with a country getting involved in international or cross-border business especially if there is comparative advantage from the business. Furthermore, a country will also not be considered to be sacrificing the well being of her citizens in venturing into exports of goods and services if the domestic demand and needs have been reasonably, if not wholly, taken care of.
