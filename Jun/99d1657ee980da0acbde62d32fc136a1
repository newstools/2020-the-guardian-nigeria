Activist and lawyer, Femi Falana (SAN), has requested a coroner’s investigation into the death of an Ibadan-based artisan, Olaoluwa Bolarinwa (41), in the custody of the Inspector General of Police’ (IGP’s) Special Tactical Squad (STS) in Ayobo, Lagos State. He made the request yesterday in a letter addressed to the Chief Coroner, High Court of Lagos State, signed on behalf of his chambers by Taiwo Olawanle. National dailies had reported the outcry by Bolarinwa’s family following his controversial death in the squad’s custody about six weeks after his alleged arrest by proxy. The deceased, according to the family, was arrested by the police from his residence in Ibadan on the grounds that they needed him to get his friend, alleged to be an armed robber, only for him to be smuggled into STS cell where he was allegedly tortured to death. In the letter to the Chief Coroner, Falana said the family instructed the chamber to report Bolarinwa’s death under controversial circumstances.
