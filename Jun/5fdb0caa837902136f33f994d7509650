It was praised galore for retiring Lagos Passport Office boss of the Nigeria Immigration Service, Comptroller Anne Agbim, as officers and friends held a special valedictory session to honour her after 35 years of service. Agbim became the Comptroller, Passport Command, Lagos on July 3, 2019. She joined the service in 1985 and served in many states, including Cross River, Ekiti, Sokoto, Ogun, Kano and Seme Border commands. The Comptroller-General of Immigration (CGI), Mohammed Babandede, at the valedictory service in Lagos, described her as “wisdom personified official that served in NIS without any blemish.” According to Babandede, Agbim was committed to work and never compromised the values of the service while in the service. Babandede, who was represented by the Assistant Comptroller-General (ACG) in charge of Zone A, Mohammed Alfa, urged other officers to imbibe the good legacies left behind by Agbim, by displaying good work ethics. He said: “She ensured that the activities of touts, all forms of indiscipline and sharp practices in Passport Commands were stopped,” he said.	Also, the Passport Control Officer (PCO) in charge of Ikoyi Passport office, Mr. Manir Yari, commended the outgoing passport boss for giving the Lagos command a good image. According to Yari, Agbim gave all necessary support to Ikoyi Passport Office to enable it to migrate to the new system that was launched by President Muhammadu Buhari in 2019. Agbim, in her vote of thanks, commended Babandede for repositioning NIS for maximum performance. “I am humbled to have served 35 years meritoriously in NIS. These years have been the best of my life. I have been trained, enjoyed loyalty and collaborations. The CGI remains my mentor. I thank him so much for giving me the opportunity to serve.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
