Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has indefinitely suspended the planned reopening of worship centres across the state, saying it is not a decision that was taken lightly, as it is simply in line with government ongoing evaluation of evolving scenarios regarding the course of the infection in Lagos State and the corresponding public health advisory guidelines issued by the experts. Speaking at the fifteenth update on Coronavirus management in the state, the governor said: “So, let me say this again: we are now hereby suspending, with immediate effect, the plan to re-open religious houses and places of worship in Lagos State, until further notice. “We will continue to monitor the situation closely, and continue to base our decision-making on data modelling; as well as on the responsibility we have to act in a manner that ensures the protection of all of you the people of Lagos State.” “Let me make this clear, that we are now fully in the phase of personal responsibility, regarding this pandemic. This means that, while the Government maintains its responsibility to take protective decisions for the common good, what will ultimately save us all and defeat this virus are the sensible personal decisions that we take on a daily basis. “Decisions to use masks anytime you are out of your house, to avoid non-essential travel, to stay at home when we don’t have any business being outside, to wash or sanitize our hands regularly – these are the simple but necessary steps that will save and protect us all.” He said as a government, his team will continue to do everything in its power to safeguard the health and wellbeing of the people, but that can only be effective when the people themselves act responsibly and do not behave in a manner that undermines public health guidelines and puts the society at risk.
