As some retail and e-commerce firms are increasing operations to meet customers’ necessities and home deliveries, there is now a surge in demand for warehouse space.
 
The industry is benefitting from the dislocation of commercial and social activities resulting in increasing demand for goods bought online. It also fuels the need for distribution facilities at a pace that’s higher than the market has seen previously and high demands in warehousing due to increasing demand for delivery service. Although there is less construction of new warehouses, people are presently converting their properties to mid-sized warehouses. Before now, when there is no high demand for warehouses, some people converted their warehouses to churches as some churches today are occupying warehouses but now reverse is the case as people are converting from other uses to warehouses because of the high demands.
 
The new development has resulted to high rental prices of warehouse space. Some owners are taking advantages of the new prices, depending on the location. For instance, Airport road and environs, it goes for between N25, 000 and N50, 000 and per square metre depending on other issues and location, while in some cases it goes up to N100, 000 per square metres.  President, International Real Estate Federation (FIABCI), Nigerian Chapter, Adeniji Adele, said the high demand for warehouses triggered by the pandemic has made courier services to thrive. He said courier services need mid-sized warehouses to stockpile their goods and deliver from there. According to him, most Nigerians are still scared of going to their offices because of social distancing and prefer to order their goods.
   
Adele, an estate surveyor and valuer, said warehouses within areas like Apapa, Isolo and Gbagada, Oshodi- Apapa, that were hitherto empty have been taken up. “So we have now more of online businesses that are now in vogue. Most people are still scared. People are no longer going to big stores such as shoprite and malls due to the coronavirus pandemic.
    
Affirming this, the Chairman, Abuja Chapter, Nigerian Institution of Estate Surveyors and Valuers (NIESV), Mr. Charles Ebai said a lot of trade is now based on e-commerce, while most families and individuals are now more comfortable with purchases that can be delivered straight in their apartments.  “They therefore are shooting up the demand for such warehouses to stockpile larger bags from where they cut into sizes. Again a lot of wines are coming into the country and the importers of such will require space”, he said.
 
Former NIESV Chairman, Lagos State chapter, Elias Ovesuor, said the pandemic is a period where people are trying to stockpile because of uncertainty of what will happen tomorrow.  “ For real estate, where there is high demand in one area, people will be forced to do some conversion here and there, real estate is an inelastic commodity. It is not something you can just increase within a short period; you cannot really increase when there is high demand. “Definitely where there is high demand of any item, their price must increase but the rate of the increase might not be too pronounced but it must definitely increase.  There are two major forms of increase in real estate. The increase can be by the number of years you pay for the rent per square metre, because if you are looking for a year and somebody is ready to pay for three years, invariably that is an increase, because if you have the money now, you will know what to do with it.   “From the economic point of view that is an increase for the person receiving it”, he added.  “This would continue to place demand for midsized warehousing and we shall continue to have conversions and remodelling of spaces of larger units of warehouses to incorporate and meet such trendy requests|”, he said.
