There is a lot of talk, stories, news and so on about coronavirus in all media at this time. Newspapers, social media, television and various other media full of one story or the other daily about coronavirus pandemic. As an individual, I have decided never to be shaken by these stories and more so as a minister of the gospel, it is what GOD says about this scourge that is of more importance to me. The word of GOD says in the book of Psalms, Chapter 91 and verses 9 and 10: Because thou hast made the Lord, which is my refuge, even the Most High, thy habitation; There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague (including coronavirus) come nigh thy dwelling. GOD is in control, there is nothing to afraid of or be worried about. Remain prayerful and read the Bible always. Having said the above, the issue of Vitamin D deficiency and its impact on those who are deficient in it needs to be looked into. From daily records, being kept all over the world, it has been confirmed that dark skinned individuals like African Americans and Latinos in Europe and in the United States are infected the most and the number of deaths is highest in the same population. Blood samples taken and tested among patients in these countries have shown that almost all the patients who have tested positive for coronavirus are also deficient in Vitamin D. In Africa the home of the dark skin people in the world, the story is not exactly the same. The death rate in this continent may not be in agreement to the Vitamin D deficiency theory. However, there has been some correlation between death rate and Vitamin D deficiency. Sources of Vitamin D: it is the only vitamin that can be produced by exposure of the skin to direct sunlight. Vitamin D is produced from cholesterol when sunlight shines directly on the skin. This is the commonest source of vitamin D. other sources of Vitamin D are cold water fish such as tuna, salmon and cod. Vitamin D can also be gotten from fish oils like cod liver oil and omega 3 fatty acids from fish oils and flaxseed oil.

Viral respiratory tract infections like the common cold, flu; sinusitis, cough etc. arise frequently as a result of Vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D is found in every cell of the body where it functions as a hormone and there are receptors for Vitamin D in all the cells of the body.
