The remains of former governor of Oyo State, Senator Abiola Ajimobi has been laid to rest at his residence, Oluyole Estate on Sunday. Ajimobi was buried at about 10 a.m. on Sunday. His burial was attended by prominent Islamic clerics including Kunle Saani, Muideen Bello, and the Chief Imam of Ibadan, Abubakri Abdulganiyu. The burial came four days after he died of coronavirus at a Lagos hospital. The deceased family alleged that the former governor’s burial was delayed due to the disagreement between the Ajimobi family and the state government. The family said the state government declined them the access to bury their patriarch in Agodi GRA. But the Oyo government has swiftly countered the claim by the Ajimobi family, saying the allegations were “spread to give the state government a bad name and to play undue politics with the dead.” “The truth of the matter is that the family, through a proxy, approached the state government and sought approval to bury the late governor on a plot of land at Agodi GRA, which is currently under litigation,” a statement by Taiwo Adisa, the chief press secretary to Governor Seyi Makinde, said. “Incidentally, it was the same former Governor Ajimobi who instituted the legal action,” he said. “Governor Seyi Makinde had no choice than to state the facts as they are to the emissaries and turn down the request. “Governor Makinde, however, against the established land use rule in Oyo State, gave approval that the family can bury the late governor in his Oluyole Estate residence. “It is to be noted that the rules guiding land use in Government Reservation Areas (GRA) forbid the burial of bodies in such locations as Oluyole Estate and Agodi GRA.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
