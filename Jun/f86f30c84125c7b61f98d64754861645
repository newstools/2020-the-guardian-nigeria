Nigeria Police on Tuesday denied media reports that it sealed the secretariat of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in Abuja. The police, however, said the presence of its personnel at the secretariat was to “maintain peace and ensure there is no breakdown of law and order at the Secretariat” and not for sealing. “The presence of police personnel at the Secretariat is not to seal-up the Complex as has been reported in some quarters but rather to prevent any untoward situation within and around the APC National Secretariat,” the police in a statement. “Members of the APC as well as staff of the Secretariat are therefore at liberty to conduct their legitimate businesses, in and around the Secretariat as always.” The heavy security presence at the ruling party’s secretariat may be connected to the ongoing leadership tussle in the APC. On Tuesday, June 17, the court of appeal affirmed the sacking of APC chairman Adams Oshiomhole, barring him from leading the affairs in the ruling party. APC’s national working committee on the same day appointed former Oyo State Governor Abiola Ajimobi as the acting chairman. The choice of Ajimobi as the acting head of the party, APC spokesman Lanre Issa-Onilu in a statement said, was according to the constitution of the party. But in a twist of events, the APC ended up producing four acting chairmen on Wednesday with different factions refusing to submit to one leadership.
