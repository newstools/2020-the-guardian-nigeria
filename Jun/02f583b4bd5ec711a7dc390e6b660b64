Nigerian Senate PHOTO: Twitter Two senators from Akwa Ibom State Albert Bassey Akpan and Christopher Ekpenyong have expressed their disappointment over non confirmation of Mary Uduk who has been the acting Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) director general. They made their position known in a petition they jointly sent to the senate over what they termed as injustice to Akwa Ibom State.
This was comming after the senate  recieved an executive communication for the confirmation of Mr. Lamido Yuguda as Director General of SEC, Reginald Karawusa, IbrahimBoyi and Obisan Joseph as full-time commissioners. The petitioners indicated that apart from her long years of service in the commission she has also been acting in that capacity for two and half years and was recommended by the honourable minister of finance to the presidency. However they said to their chargrin the name that came to the floor of the senate as SEC DG was that of Lamido Yuguda. They indicated that the person so nominated has no experience on the workings of SEC in comparison with Uduk. They therefore appealed for the indulgence of the senate to do justice to Akwa Ibom state. In defense of President Buhari’s mandate senator Danjuma Goje said,
“This is something I don’t understand because it is not this senate that nominated Ibrahim Yuguda. It was Mr president in his own wisdom pursuant to the powers conferred on him by the constitution. The Senate President in his comment said, “My understanding is that those who signed the petition will be invited by the Senate committee on ethics and privileges to come and explain what they mean.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
