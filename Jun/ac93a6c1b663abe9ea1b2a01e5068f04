• Development exposes rot in aviation, stakeholders say Embattled local charter operator, Executive Jet, yesterday, apologised for carrying out illegal operations, saying it was tricked into the prohibited flight.
 
The carrier, which has been suspended indefinitely, airlifted a popular musician, Naira Marley, to a concert in Abuja.  The Federal Government had on Monday, suspended Executive Jets Services for flying the musician contrary to the approval it was granted. The musician was flown from Lagos to Abuja in breach of COVID-19 restrictions.
 
But the Federal Government explained the flight was meant to fly in Hon. Justice Adefope Okojie from Lagos to Abuja, and back to Lagos and not the musician.  Aviation security consultant, Group Capt. John Ojikutu (rtd.), said no unscheduled international flight or domestic flight in the type of emergency as we have now would file a flight plan without flight approved by the responsible authority. 
 
“The controller must ensure that the flight approval accompanied the flight plan. If that is not done, not only is the procedure breached, the national security is compromised. The situation where these occur is not normal.
 
“There are things I did not know before now, which I still believe the controller must take responsibility for. The approval was given for a particular day or date but the flight was conducted on another date. Did the controller check that? That to me is where his own verification starts. Many things happen at MMA, which bother on the national security; the absence of normal and the presence of abnormal. It a matter of the more you look, the more you see, except you are blind.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
