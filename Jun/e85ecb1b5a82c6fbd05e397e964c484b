The Federal Medical Centre (FMC), Ebute-Meta, in partnership with PharmAccess Foundation and Luscii, has launched a COVID-19  digital screening that will help in the fight against the pandemic in Nigeria. The digital service, Luscii, screens for symptoms of the deadly virus and connects users to dedicated medical responders for advice on how to manage their care, while it also triggers users to conduct daily checks and monitor the symptoms based on the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) guidelines via the digital service platform. The Country Director, PharmAccess Foundation, Njide Ndili, said the COVID-19 Connect digital service would help users to self-monitor and connect those who fall within the high-risk category to trained medical responders at FMC Ebute Meta for counseling and admission into Lagos COVID-19 response system. According to her, benefits derived by use of the digital service include early detection of suspected cases for testing and containment, home isolation and care for mild cases, thus freeing up healthcare capacity for high-risk patients and allowing the state to maximise its resources for patients with more acute symptoms. Chief Medical Director of the FMC, Dr Adedamola Dada, expressed enthusiasm to support the stateâ€™s response to contain the spread of COVID-19.
