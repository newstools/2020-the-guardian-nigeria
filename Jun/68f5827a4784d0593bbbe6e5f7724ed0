The Criterion, an Association of Muslim Women in Business and Professions, has condemned the spate of rape and murder in the country in recent times. The Association also called for justice and a comprehensive investigation into the gruesome murders of Barakat in Ibadan, Uwaila Omozuwa in Benin and Azeezat, who was also brutally murdered in Ibadan. A statement by its National Ameerah (President), Hajia Fatymah Yewande Oyefeso, called on relevant authorities to bring perpetrators to book and ensure they do not go unpunished. Oyefeso lamented the incessant incidents of rape and murder of girl-child and young women in Nigeria. She said: “Violence against women in any form is against Islamic injunctions. Barakat was a decent woman that adorned hijab according to Islam dictate. It is pathetic that despite dressing decently, Barakat was raped and gruesomely murdered. We are yet to overcome the shock of the recent gruesome rape and murder of Uwavera Omozuwa, a 22- year-old Microbiology Student of University of Benin and this one happened again. “We appeal to the Inspector General of Police to bring perpetrators of this heinous crime to justice immediately. The increasing incidents of rape and murder of girl-child is worrisome. Violence against women must stop.
