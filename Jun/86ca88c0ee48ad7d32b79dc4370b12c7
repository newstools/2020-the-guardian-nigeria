 ECOWAS.  This was disclosed in a statement to celebrate 45 years of the organisation, with the theme, ‘Promoting socio-economic and human development together through regional integration and Combating Covid-19 together in West Africa’. The President of the ECOWAS Commission, H.E. Jean-Claude Kassi Brou in his statement to commemorate the 45th anniversary highlighted that ECOWAS member states have shown resilience in going through political, economic, social and health challenges together and coming out stronger in the past 45 years. According to Brou, efforts of ECOWAS were compromised by insecurity and threat of terrorism in the central Sahel region and North Eastern Nigeria., which led to a counter-reaction of the creation of a Regional Action Plan adopted in December 2019 by the ECOWAS Heads of State and Government. According to Brou, The ECOWAS Commission and WAHO have been working to support Member States since the first case of COVID-19 was reported in the Region by providing essential medical supplies and equipment as well as capacity building. “The Community continues to build on the on the core elements of the integration project, including free movement of persons and goods and the right of establishment. Progress has also been made in the area of democracy and good governance in the Region with the ECOWAS Electoral assistance programme, and also peace keeping and Regional security through the ECOWAS Standby Force and Mediation,” he said.
