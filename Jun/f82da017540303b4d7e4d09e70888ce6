A 17-year-old-boy, popularly known as Kim, and four other persons have been consumed by the renewed violent clash between two rival cult groups, Iceland and Bobos, in Amarata, a suburb of Yenagoa, Bayelsa State capital. The boy’s death threw the entire community into mourning, with residents lamenting the incessant cult war in the state capital. The bloody cult war, which began two weeks ago, according to some residents, made a mockery of the attempts by the state government through the office of the State Vigilante Service to promote peace among cult groups in the state. Tariebi, who was caught between the cult clash when he went to buy foodstuff for his family, was not linked with any of the outlawed groups. A resident who pleaded anonymity, explained, “A commercial tricycle was sighted entering the street about 7.30 p.m. with three boys inside. We heard gunshots. By the time the dust settled, the boy was found lifeless. “If you visit the Apex Academy road, we are in mourning. Most residents have contributed some money to assist in the boy’s burial. Though the police came for the corpse, they later brought it back for the family to bury him properly.” While residents claimed that five persons died in the mayhem, spokesman of the state’s police command, Asimin Butswat, said reports available showed that only two deaths were recorded. However, he added that the police command had commenced investigations into the cult clash at Amarata and some other places in the state capital. “The leaders of the cult groups have been identified and efforts are underway to arrest and prosecute the perpetrators,” he said.
