While other federations have cancelled or postponed their activities this year due to the raging COVID-19 pandemic, the Nigerian Wrestling Federation (NWF) are still optimistic that they would fulfill some of the events listed in their calendar this year. NWF President, Daniel Igali, said on Tuesday that the NWF would wait for the outcome of the International Wrestling Federation (IWF) meeting to fit in their programmes for the rest of the year, as the COVID-19 pandemic eases out. 
 
Major international competitions were cancelled due to the scourge of the coronavirus pandemic, which has ravaged sporting activities across the globe. Among them are the Tokyo 2020 Olympics earlier scheduled for August this year and also various leagues globally suspended because of the pandemic.  It is not all gloom as Igali revealed that the lockdown has helped some of the athletes to recover from injuries.
 
“Athletes hardly get two to three months to fully recover from injuries they sustained. A lot of times athletes compete with injuries all year round and they don’t have enough time to allow the injuries to heal. But the COVID-19 pandemic has allowed total healing to take place.
 
“I have told all of them that this is the time to allow their injuries to heal fully so that when they return for competition, they will return hungry, and straight for the trainings and their eyes set on goals for next year’s events,” he stated.
