Local airlines have urged the Federal Government and the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19 to reopen the airspace for airlines and airports that have satisfied safety protocol to begin operations.
 
The carriers, under the aegis of Airlines Operators of Nigeria (AON), said more days were bound to be wasted and revenues lost should the system wait for every stakeholder to be ready.
