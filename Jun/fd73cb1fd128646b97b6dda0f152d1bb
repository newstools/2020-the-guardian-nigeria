  "It is clear that the protests have been sadly hijacked by extremists intent on violence," Johnson said in a statement issued on Twitter. Police have boarded up prominent statues around London ahead of a new wave of demonstrations and rallies this weekend. A famous statue of Winston Churchill outside parliament was defaced last weekend during "Black Lives Matter" rallies sparked by George Floyd's death during a police arrest in Minnesota on May 25. Johnson called the targeting of Churchill "absurd and shameful". "The statue of Winston Churchill in Parliament Square is a permanent reminder of his achievement in saving this country -- and the whole of Europe -- from a fascist and racist tyranny," said Johnson, who lists the war-time leader as one of his personal heroes. "Yes, he sometimes expressed opinions that were and are unacceptable to us today, but he was a hero, and he fully deserves his memorial," Johnson wrote. Protesters blame Churchill for policies that led to the death of millions during a famine in the Indian state of Bengal in 1943. "We cannot now try to edit or censor our past. We cannot pretend to have a different history," said Johnson. "The statues in our cities and towns were put up by previous generations."
