Official portrait of President Donald J. Trump Image Wikipedia Snapchat has disclosed that they will no longer promote President Trump’s account on its Discover media platform according to a report by Hollywood Reporter. Evan Spiegel-led Snap said it made the decision after determining that Trump’s comments could incite violence. The company pointed to tweets from Trump over the weekend in which he threatened to send “vicious dogs” and “ominous weapons” to stop the protests that have been taking place across the country in response to the death of George Floyd at the hands of the police. In the words of a company spokeswoman according to a statement: Racial violence and injustice have no place in our society and we stand together with all who seek peace, love, equality, and justice in America. Snap’s decision comes as social media platforms weigh their role in disseminating the comments of the president that threaten violence or contain misinformation. Last week, Twitter began labeling tweets from the president that violate its policies. Facebook, meanwhile, has said it would not take action on Trump’s posts, this led employees to stage a virtual walkout on Monday. In reaction to twitter’s action, Trump denounced the move and signed an executive order that charged federal regulators with pulling back the legal protections that shield social media companies from liability in what is posted to their platforms. Trump’s account will remain public on Snapchat, and users will be able to continue to search for and subscribe to it. Snapchat has long maintained that Discover is a curated feed and not a public “town square.” Snapchat is a popular messaging app that lets users exchange pictures and videos (called snaps) that are meant to disappear after they’re viewed. It’s advertised as a “new type of camera” because the essential function is to take a picture or video, add filters, lenses, or other effects and share them with friends.
