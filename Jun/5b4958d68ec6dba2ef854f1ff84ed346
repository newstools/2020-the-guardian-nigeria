Rebuilding Nigeria into a nation where citizens can lead a good life and poverty reduced significantly is not just a task for the leaders, but every well-meaning groups and individuals. That was the submission made during the first year anniversary of the Olusoji Akinwande Development Foundation (OADF) by the founder, Olusoji Akinwande. Akinwande, who said the birth of the foundation a year ago was based on his conviction on the need for more conscious leaders, stressed that when the giant in every Nigerian is awakened, the quest to reduce poverty among the population would become easily achievable. He said: “There is a need for more conscientious leaders who would understand the urgent need to rebrand our nation, Africa and indeed, our people. That is when potholes will become history on our roads, when needless accidents can be avoided; when no family would go to bed hungry, and when entrepreneurs would stop closing shops due to high cost of operations.” OADF has a three-prong focus on Humanitarian, Entrepreneurship interventions, and National Development (HEND), which are critical to achieving the foundation’s desired impact and resonates with its vision of ‘Building a people and the African of our dream.’ In line with this, within its one year, it has given various categories of scholarships to students, it is offering mentorship to a number of start-ups, it has given cash grants to entrepreneurs. It has made food donations to the needy across the country under its Food-for-1200-Family initiative.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
