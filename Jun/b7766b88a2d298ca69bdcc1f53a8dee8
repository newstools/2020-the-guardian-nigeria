The power play between the Minister of Power, Sale Mamman and the Managing Director of Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading, PLC (NBET) Dr. Marilyn Amobi yesterday took a new twist as the minister again sacked the director and appointed a new head. While the minister blamed the new development on re-engineering of the sector, he had in December ordered suspension of the Managing Director of the Rural Electrification Agency (REA), Damilola Ogunbiyi and asked for the immediate stepping down of the Amobi. But Sale’s decision was overruled by the Presidency while it approved the constitution of NBET’s new board naming minister of finance as the chairman of the board. NBET, created in 2020 as the manager and administrator of the electricity pool in the Nigerian electricity supply industry (NESI), pursuant to section eight and licensed by section 68 of the Electric Power Sector Reform Act (EPSRA), 2005 to provide services to the power sector. While it has remained under the Power Ministry, President Muhammadu Buhari recently had approved that the agency is moved to the Ministry of Finance, a development, which has created criticism in the sector. Mamman’s Special Adviser, Media & Communications Aaron Artimas however stated that   Dr. Nnaemeka Eweluka, who was NBET’s General Counsel and Secretary has been appointed to replace Amobi. He said that the decision has been approved by Buhari, adding that Amobi would proceed on a terminal leave with immediate effect. “Dr. Eweluka, a lawyer comes to this position with over twenty years’ experience, spanning private practice, academics and the Power sector. “He is a specialist on privatization and legal energy reforms as well as a member of the Chartered Institute of Arbitration,” Artimas said.
