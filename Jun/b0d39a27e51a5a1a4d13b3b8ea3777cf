Despite the further easing of lockdown across the country, negative sentiments dominated Nigeria’s equities market at the close of trading last week. The development caused the NSE All-share index and market capitalisation to depreciate by 1.00 per cent and 0.90 per cent, to close the week at 25,016.30 and N13.050trillion, respectively. Also, all other indices finished lower with the exception of NSE AFR Div Yield and NSE Consumer Goods, which appreciated by 1.20 per cent and 0.26 per cent, respectively, while NSE ASeM closed flat. Analysts linked the downturn to the rising COVID-19 crisis, currently ravaging the entire domestic and foreign economies. It is noteworthy that Nigeria has recorded about 12,233 cases with 342 deaths in the last four months.

The uptrend was impacted by gains recorded in large and medium value stocks, amongst which were; Dangote Sugar Refinery, Nigerian Breweries, Guaranty Trust Bank, Vitafoam Nigeria, and BUA Cement. Analysts at Imperial Asset Managers Limited had envisaged “a measure of profit-taking, as some active traders may likely cash in on the profit,” while those at Afrinvest Research anticipated “a mixed performance.” “Nonetheless, we reiterated that investors with long-term investment goal should continue to build their portfolios given the current attractive valuation of most fundamentally viable stocks,” they added. Transactions on the equities sector continued on a positive note on Tuesday, as more bellwether stocks appreciated at price, resulting in a further rise in market capitalisation by N47billion.

Analysts at Codros Capital said: “Our opinion, risks remain on the horizon due to a combination of the increasing number of COVID-19 cases in Nigeria, and weak economic conditions. Thus, we continue to advise investors to trade cautiously and seek trading opportunities in only fundamentally justified stocks.” Analysts at InvestData Securities Limited, said: "We expect profit-taking to continue, as breakout or breakdown at this consolidation level will confirm next market direction despite profit-taking, as investors positioning reveals confidence among market players, implying that opportunities are still available before the Q2-driven earnings expectation. "Also, sectors that have suffered oversold, so far, offer attractive risk-reward buy-opportunities and outlook for consideration ahead of the Q2 economic and corporate data."
