Worried by the huge housing deficit estimated at over 17 million, the Group Chief Executive Officer, Oxford Group Nigeria, Teni Adesanya, has tasked the country’s economic managers to pass a law that would make land documentation seamless.
 
Specifically, he said if a bill that will make land documentation as easy as opening an email is passed into law, the country’s housing deficit would be addressed quickly.
   
Adesanya, who stated this at the grand opening of its member companies, Oxford Group Limited in Lagos, said plans are ongoing to make housing available for more than 100,000 families in the next five years. He called on the Lagos State government to join hands with the private sector to address the nation’s housing deficit. “What we did in the area of real estate is to develop a software that will help us know the number of clients that we have, the number of people that need housing and we have also invested in infotech to help us address quite a number of issues we have in Nigeria,” he stressed.
