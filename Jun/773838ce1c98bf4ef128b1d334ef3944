Former Deputy Chief Whip of the House of Representatives, Pally Iriase, on Sunday cited reasons why the All Progressives Congress should be consider direct primaries in Edo State due to covid-19 pandemic. APC governorship primary election in Edo state slated for June 22 but model to be adopted for the exercise has generated debates among party stakeholders. While Edo APC supports the indirect mode of primaries, the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party insisted on direct primaries. Indirect mode means that delegates alone elect the party’s flag-bearer, while in direct mode, all registered party members do the election. In his view, Iriase said, “most agitators for indirect primaries in Edo State have ironically based their arguments on the need to ensure that the exercise does not lead to an increase in Covid-19 cases in the state.” “However a study of the processes involved in indirect Primaries as contained in the APC Constitution shows that it is the Indirect method that must be avoided to safeguard the health of our people under this pandemic,” Iriase a think tank and strategist of the party in 2015 in a chat with journalists late Sunday evening said. Edo State has 284 confirmed cases of coronavirus out of Nigeria’s 10,162 cases. Iriase, a former Secretary to the Edo State Government, SSG, said the party’s constitution “provides that Indirect primaries shall be done at a designated venue by an Electoral College of DELEGATES who shall be democratically elected by members of the Party at their various Ward Congresses.” “It is clear that without ulterior motive, Direct Primaries is better than Indirect Primaries which requires two tedious stages with huge but avoidable health challenges,” Iriase stated.
