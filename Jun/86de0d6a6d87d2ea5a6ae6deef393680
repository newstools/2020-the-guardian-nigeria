The new round of talks in Brussels will be the first to be held face-to-face since the coronavirus shutdown combined with the two sides’ entrenched positions to stall progress.

Michel Barnier, the EU’s negotiator for future relations with the UK, said Britain was trying to preserve the benefits of membership for its big banks and investors. “I will be blunt: its proposals are unacceptable,” Barnier said in a virtual speech to the Eurofi financial conference. January 1, when a post-Brexit transition period ends, will “bring big changes” to London-based financial companies, he said. “This should not come as a surprise to you. We have been warning about this for the past three years,” he said. Barnier made his comments as the EU and Britain were holding talks in Brussels on forging their future ties after four months of fruitless negotiations. Global banks from Wall Street and Asia are hoping to maintain their vast operations in London as much as possible. Barnier said that Britain “would like to make it easy to continue to run EU businesses from London, with minimal operations and staff on the continent.” “There is no way member states or the European Parliament would accept this.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
