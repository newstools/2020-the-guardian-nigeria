Nigeria’s ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) on Thursday appointed Yobe State governor Mala Buni as the chairman of its caretaker committee. “Governor of Yobe State, H.E Mai Mala Buni has just been appointed as the chairman, All Progressives Congress (APC)’s caretaker committee and extraordinary national convention,” presidential aide Bashir Ahmad tweeted. Buni’s appointment came after the APC dissolved the national working committee of the party during its national executive council meeting on Thursday. The meeting convened by  Victor Giadom whom President Muhammadu Buhari recognised as the acting chairman of the party, also had vice president Yemi Osinbajo in attendance. Others at the meeting were Senate president Ahmad Lawan, the speaker of the house of representatives Femi Gbajabiamila and 15 APC governors from Nasarawa, Niger, Jigawa, Yobe, Plateau, Kogi, Imo, Gombe, Osun, Ogun, Lagos, Kwara, Ekiti, Kano and Kebbi State. Speaking after his emergence as chairman of the caretaker committee, Buni assured APC members of the justice in managing the ongoing crisis in the party. “As a former 2-term National Secretary, I know the party very well, and it’s all about doing justice to every member of the party,” Buni said. “Without justice there won’t be peace.” “If you don’t manage crisis obviously crisis will manage you.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
