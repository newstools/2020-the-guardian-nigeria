The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) yesterday said that the leadership of the Lagos State House of Assembly had irredeemably lost the rectitude to preside over legislations or make appropriation for Lagosians. The party, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, alleged that the Lagos Assembly had become “incurably smeared with issues of corruption, misappropriation and allegations of embezzlement of funds meant for the welfare of the people of Lagos State.” He said: “Our party notes that the revelations at the fact-finding panel of the Lagos Assembly on corruption allegations against the leadership of the state legislature is incorrigible.” The party, which insisted that the Speaker should clear his name by surrendering himself to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) for investigation instead of limiting his defence to an in-house committee of the legislature, over which he presides, said: “Nigerians are shocked by revelations at the panel of how funds meant for the welfare of Lagosians were dissipated on luxurious SUVs, frivolous foreign trips and funding of expensive and wasteful lifestyles of certain lawmakers and their relations, while the people are neglected and abandoned to a life of squalor.” The PDP, therefore, challenged the Speaker to show Nigerians how much he had approved for hardworking Lagosians, especially the youths, who had continued to be denied opportunities for scholarships, economic empowerment, employment and sponsorship to excel in various fields of endeavour. It also challenged the Speaker to show what steps his legislature had taken to uplift the living standard of downtrodden Lagos women who had continued to bear the weight of poverty and heavy taxes imposed by the APC administration in the state.
