He added that the app would address the medical brain drain in Nigeria as well as strengthen healthcare delivery in the country. He explained, “MyDokita app provides Nigerians affordable instant access to a second opinion on their diagnosis and medical prescriptions thereby reducing the risk of misdiagnosis or wrong prescription. At the moment, there is no platform that allows collaboration and knowledge transfer between all the great Nigerian medical practitioners outside the country and those within the country. We have developed the MyDokita app to make this happen. “The platform allows for mentoring, knowledge transfer and collaboration between medical practitioners at home and abroad. The app, created in partnership with Pius Akanni Akintola Foundation, is live on Google Play Store.” Akintola stressed that most Nigerians were facing tough health care decisions and have had hard times knowing what to do.
