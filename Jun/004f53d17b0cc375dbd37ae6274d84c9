The journey to the disqualification of Edo State Governor Godwin Obaseki from the June 22 governorship primary of the governing All Progressives Congress (APC) preceded the verdict of the Prof. Ayuba Jonathan-led screening committee.
 
The crisis of confidence between the governor and his former political benefactor and predecessor, as well as National Chairman of the party, Adams Oshiomhole, started during the Edo State delegate congress of APC in 2018.
 
While the former governor, who had just resumed office as national chairman, used the opportunity to reward his loyalists and all those that worked for his emergence, Obaseki was not allowed to input his own loyalists.
 
Stung by Oshiomhole’s apparent attempt to maintain control of the levers of political power in the state, the governor, who had just been in office for two years, decided to take his pound of flesh last year when it was time to proclaim the 8th Edo State House of Assembly. He played a fast one by dribbling Oshiomhole’s loyalists to ensure the emergence of Francis Okiye as Speaker, instead of Francis Ederor, preferred by the national chairman.  The implications of excluding the governor from further participation in the candidate selection exercise are many and varied. One, the ruling party would remain embattled, seeing that it appears the decision to debar the governor had the blessing of President Muhammadu Buhari and Asiwaju Bola Tinubu.
 
Two, given the general perception that Obaseki gave a good account of his mandate as governor, he might be tempted to contest the primary election on an alternative platform to test his popularity.
 
More importantly, first term governors in the party might interpret the development as a gradually emerging pattern and decide to show solidarity with Obaseki and insist on his participation or moving out en masse from APC.
 
Alternatively, Obaseki might stay put in the party and work against the APC candidate in the main election, especially given his boast that he can do just one term to ensure the end of godfathering. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
