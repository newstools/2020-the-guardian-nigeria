The former champion of the Liberia Open, Kabiru Mohammed Haruna believes that new captain of the Kano Golf Club, Ali Magashi, is on a mission to change the fortune of the club such that it would become the playground of the best golfers in the country. Magashi became the captain of Kano Golf Club in February.
 
Attesting to Magashi’s determination to turn the club around, Haruna, who is a professional at the Kano Club, said the new captain had been hampered by the COVID-19 pandemic, adding, however, “members of Kano Golf Club have great respect and belief in what Ali Magashi can do. “Kano Golf Club has witnessed some setbacks, including in greening the entire golf course, but we have the confidence Magashi will surely address it in his tenure. In fact, before the end of this year.”
 
Magashi, who was elected unopposed, on assuming office, pledged to upgrade the club established in 1908 to a modern and international standard. The 18-hole course is still brown with only three greens.
 
The former aeronautic engineer and communications mogul also pledged to ensure the hosting of quality and international tournaments that would attract interests from investors and grassroots participation.
 
Haruna affirmed that there could not have been a worse time for Magashi to take over the captaincy than the Coronavirus pandemic period. “There are many programmes already lined up and as soon as the COVID-19 pandemic is over, Kano Golf Club will surely bubble again for the delight of every member and all golfers in general,” he said.Magashi (handicap 11) took over the captaincy from Habibu Abdullahi.
