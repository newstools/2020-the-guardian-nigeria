Govt imposes 24-hour curfew on two chiefdoms Isaac Auta, representing Kauru Constituency, has emerged the new Deputy Speaker of Kaduna State House of Assembly amidst a rowdy session. He was appointed after 24 members of the house passed a vote of no confidence in the former deputy speaker, Mukhtar Hazo, and impeached him. They reportedly accused him of plotting to oust the Speaker, Yusuf Zelaini, from office. Auta was immediately sworn in by the Clerk of the Assembly.
Auta’s emergence and swearing-in preceded a rowdy session, as Liman Dahiru, representing Makera Constituency, stormed the floor and went for the mace. However, before he could make his way out of the chamber, he was grabbed by the Sergeant-at-Arms, while other members quickly rushed and retrieved the mace from him. The plenary ended in a rowdy session, while Liman was dragged out of the chamber. Liman, who had his dress in shreds and beaten to pulp, was later seen outside the assembly chamber expressing anger over the impeachment of Hazo. But attempts by the lawmakers to impeach the speaker failed. MEANWHILE, the state government has imposed a 24-hour curfew on Atyap Chiefdom of Zangon Kataf Council and Chawai Chiefdom in Kauru Council, following tension arising from a clash over farmland. According to the state government, the curfew takes immediate effect. This was contained in a statement issued yesterday by the Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan. Aruwan added, “Security agencies are containing the tension arising from a clash last week over a farmland in Zangon-Kataf.” According to the commissioner, community leaders had tried to ease the tension, which seemed to have escalated.
