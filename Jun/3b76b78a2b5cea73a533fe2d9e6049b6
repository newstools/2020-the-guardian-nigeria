Former British Prime Minister, David Cameron, has called for the replacement of the World Health Organisation (WHO), citing the organisation’s alleged failure to give swift coronavirus reports.
  
He called for the United Nations (UN) agency’s current role to be given to a new body, saying it had been too concerned about upsetting China in the early stage of the crisis, and too slow to warn the rest of the world.
  
“The World Health Organisation should be stripped of its responsibilities to warn about future pandemics after its failures over coronavirus,” the ex-premier said.  The Asian nation appears to have tamed a new occurrence in its capital, once again demonstrating health officials’ ability to quickly mobilise vast resources by testing nearly 2.5 million people in 11 days.
