Dipping figures of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases in Kano State is generating mixed feelings amid growing concern on the credibility of the results being released by the authorities. Against the astronomic rise of active cases of the deadly virus across 34 states and Federal Capital Territory, Kano is incidentally witnessing unprecedented fall in the COVID-19 curve, at least in the last two weeks. Considering Kano’s population, there are worries on whether the sudden drop in the cases is a brighter signal of relief or sign of another danger looming. The Guardian learnt that one of the most celebrated mobile modular laboratories donated for COVID-19 testing has failed to activate any sample. Kano recorded its index case on Saturday, April 11, 2020, when a retired ambassador who had visited Abuja, Lagos and Kaduna, tested positive for COVID-19. Few days after the first case, record of positive cases from Kano shot up astronomically. At some point, Kano became the epicentre after displacing several states on the chart, only next to Lagos. But Governor Abdullahi Ganduje has attributed the decline to fast acceptance of residents to the reality of the virus. Ganduje, who expressed satisfaction on the sudden drop during a recent public function at the Government House, claimed that residents were adapting to health protocols and culture of social distancing, despite the inconvenience of persistent lockdown in the state. “We understand the reality of the virus and the danger attached, but the fact is that people have taken their destiny in their own hands. People are now taking the preventive safe measures seriously and it is now becoming a way of life. “Observing the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) protocols like use of face mask, washing of hands with soap, use of sanitiser, social distancing in the public places are now taken like culture.
