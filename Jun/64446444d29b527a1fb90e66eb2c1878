–says 300,00 indigenes have been screened for COVID-19 Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo state on Monday visited the Presidential Villa, Abuja, where he presented his interest form, seeking re-election under All Progressive Congress (APC), to President Mohammadu Buhari. The visit is coming ahead of the party’s governorship primary election scheduled for June 22. There has been a power tussle between the party national chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, and Obaseki which has created factions within the state branch of the party. Amidst this feud, the party has slated June 22 for its direct primary election, a method the Obaseki-led faction chairman in the state, Anselm Ojezua, earlier kicked against. Briefing State House Correspondents on the purpose of the visit to the Presidency, Obaseki said though President Buhari was a father to all, it will be morally wrong to take things for granted, hence his decision to formally inform him. The governor also said over 300,000 of the Edo indigenes have been screen for COVID-19 out of the 500,000 targets set by the government. Further, Obaseki vowed to ensure the killers of the 100-level student of the University of Benin, Uwaila Omozuwa, are tracked and brought to justice, describing the crime as heinous.
