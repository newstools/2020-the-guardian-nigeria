Beyonce has released a new single titled “Black Parade” in honour of the Juneteenth holiday. “Black Parade” was released on Friday, the Juneteenth – a holiday which celebrates the emancipation of those who had been enslaved in the United States in 1865. Originating in Texas, it is now celebrated annually on the 19th of June throughout the United States, with varying official recognition. “Happy Juneteenth Weekend! I hope we continue to share joy and celebrate each other, even in the midst of struggle. Please continue to remember our beauty, strength and power,” Beyonce said as she announces the song on her Instagram page. Listen to “Black Parade” below: Black Parade is Beyoncé’s first solo release since last year’s Homecoming, a live album and documentary covering her blockbuster performance at Coachella in 2018; and The Lion King: The Gift, which accompanied Disney’s live-action remake of its classic animation. Beyonce also announced the launch of the Black Parade project which provides an online directory of black-owned businesses ranging from fashion and art to food and drink. “BLACK PARADE” celebrates you, your voice and your joy and will benefit Black-owned small businesses,” the singer wrote on her Instagram page.
