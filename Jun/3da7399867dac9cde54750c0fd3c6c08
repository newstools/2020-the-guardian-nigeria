As the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic continues to present challenges to businesses and economies globally, FMDQ Holdings PLC, Financial Sector Deepening (FSD) Africa, and Climate Bonds Initiative (CBI), have partnered in facilitating a stakeholder engagement to boost Nigeria’s agricultural sector through green financing.
 
According to the organisations, it was imperative that creative and proactive solutions are proffered to ensure the continued sustenance of key sectors of economies, and the Nigerian agribusiness sector is not left behind. 
 
They maintained that it was vital for market participants in Nigeria’s financial market space to join the conversation in the implementation of the Nigerian Green Bond Market Development Programme.
