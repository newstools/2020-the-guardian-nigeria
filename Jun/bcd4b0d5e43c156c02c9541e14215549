It is healthy to relieve your bladder, however, if it becomes too frequent, you might have to visit your doctor. Below are some medical reasons you are urinating frequently according to The Healthy. Urinary Tract Infection
Frequent urination can be a symptom of many different problems from kidney disease to simply drinking too much fluid. However, when frequent urination is accompanied by fever, an urgent need to urinate, and pain or discomfort in the abdomen, you may have a urinary tract infection. A urinary tract infection can hit when bacteria makes its way into the bladder, but this can be treated with medication. Pregnancy
During the early stages of pregnancy, hormonal changes can lead to an increased frequency of urination, so it’s common to urinate a lot, especially during the first trimester. These causes of frequent urination during pregnancy are very common, and they are not harmful to the mother or baby. Overactive Bladder Syndrome
People with overactive bladder syndrome might experience involuntary bladder contractions that lead to frequent and often urgent urination, meaning you get that urge even when your bladder is empty. According to Dr.Nnadi: Bladder retraining can help in this situation which involves increasing the intervals between using the bathroom over the course of about 12 weeks. This helps retrain your bladder to hold urine longer and to urinate less frequently. Some people also find success with Botox. Botox can be injected into the bladder muscle, causing the bladder to relax, increasing its storage capacity, and reducing episodes of leakage, and several types of surgery are also available. Anxiety
Being nervous or having anxiety can lead to frequent urination according to Dr. Landry. Typically, the bladder continues to expand until it is full. Then, the bladder sends a signal to the brain that it’s time to urinate. And usually, we can suppress the sensation until it is convenient to void, but when people are anxious, the bladder can become more active. To tackle this, some options include stress reduction, meditation or relaxation techniques, yoga, and pelvic floor physical therapy. Stroke
According to Dr. Nandi, having a stroke can sometimes damage nerves in the bladder and lead to excess urination. Since the muscles used to urinate may be affected, which can cause bladder control issues, a urinary catheter may be needed to resolve the frequent urge. Strokes can also affect cognition which can also cause excessive urination as well as incontinence. The medical information provided in this article is provided as an information resource only.
