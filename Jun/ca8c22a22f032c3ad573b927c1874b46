As Nigeria marks 21 years anniversary of uninterrupted democracy today, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has accused the President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration of violating and raping the nation’s democracy. It lamented that the present administration violated the legacies of June 12 and the core values the late Moshood Kashimawo Olawale (MKO) Abiola stood for. Its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, said at a media briefing in Abuja yesterday that Abiola stood for credible electoral process, respect for rule of law, constitutional separation of powers, unity and national cohesion and sensibility of Nigerians. He also fostered respect for citizens’ rights, freedom of speech and tolerance, free press, respect for principle of federal character, transparency, accountability and productivity in governance, fairness, equity and justice. The party also berated President Buhari for what it described as democratic infractions Nigerians have witnessed under his government in the last five years. “The infractions include, electoral malpractices at the highest levels, political intolerance, violence and vicious propaganda, violation of constitutional provisions, disregard for the principle of federal character and democratic sensibilities of Nigerians. “He also violated constitutional principle of separation of powers through brazen invasion, intimidation, coercion and arm-twisting of the judiciary and legislative arms of government. “Others are financial recklessness and lack of accountability including razing of government buildings to cover fraud, harassment and hounding of opposition members, disobedience of court orders, abuse of constitutionally guaranteed human rights and personal liberty of citizens,” it stated. The PDP also listed suppression of free speech, harassment of journalists and curtailing of press freedom, unlawful arrests and detention, particularly of dissenting voices and perceived antagonists of government, extra-judicial killings and brutality of citizens, concealment of corruption and official cover for corrupt officials, nepotism and willful erosion of national cohesion, among others, as some the infractions. The party saluted Nigerians for their resilience in protecting the nation’s democracy in spite of the violations, coercions and abuse of democratic tenets by the APC-led administration. It lamented that the PDP was saddened that the country was currently presided over by persons whose actions showed that they do not believe in, or have any regard for democracy or national wellbeing. “Such persons have emasculated democratic principles and desecrated all that MKO Abiola stood for, fought for and eventually died for. “At the foundation of every genuine democracy is a credible electoral process. Painfully, the Buhari Presidency and the APC have continued to suppress every genuine effort for reforms that will improve our electoral processes. “It is instructive to note that President Buhari and APC came to power in 2015 as a result of electoral reform carried out by PDP administration.
“But sadly, Mr. President has frustrated every move to ensure more credible election, particularly by refusing to sign the Electoral Act Amendment Bill sent to him by the National Assembly,” it added. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
