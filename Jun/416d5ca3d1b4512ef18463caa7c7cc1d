Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki has been accused of violating the guidelines of the Presidential Task-Force on COVID-19 on social gathering during his defection to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Friday. Prince John Mayaki, Director of Communication and Media, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu Campaign Organisation, in a statement in Benin, yesterday, accused the governor and his supporters of making mockery of the Presidential Task-Force on COVID-19 on social gathering and his ill-conceived gazette which, among other things, held that no gathering of more than 20 persons is allowed. He said: “Governor Godwin Obaseki exercised his right of assembly to join a political party by completing his defection to the PDP today. However, we observed with great concern the dangerous and reckless actions of the Governor and his supporters at the venue of his defection. “Without any observance of the social distancing rules, or the use of face masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19, Mr. Godwin Obaseki assembled hundreds of Edo youths that his administration failed to gainfully engage, following his failure to create 200,000 jobs as promised, and assigned them the demeaning task of singing his praises at great risk to their health during a pandemic…” Mayaki called on the Nigeria Police Force and other relevant security agencies to aid the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) in the commencement of an immediate identification, tracing, and arrest of everyone present at the event for immediate quarantine at nearby isolation centres.
 
He said failure to do this might jeopardise the integrity of the fight against COVID-19 and make a mockery of the efforts and sacrifice of frontline health workers and other important stakeholders.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
