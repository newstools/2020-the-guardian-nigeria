Nigeria’s weak economic situation exacerbated by the increasing number of COVID-19 cases, has continued to trigger negative sentiments on the equities market. Specifically, at the close of trading last week on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), the All-Share index and market capitalisation fell by 0.99 per cent to close the week at 24,826.75, and N12.951 trillion respectively. All other indices finished lower with the exception of NSE-Main Board, NSE MERI Growth, NSE Consumer Goods, NSE Lotus II and NSE Industrial Goods Indices, which appreciated by 1.00 per cent. Analysts at the weekend, linked the negative sentiments to increasing number of COVID-19 cases in Nigeria and weak economic state of the country. However, they expressed optimism of imminent rebound, noting that the current low prices of stocks may spur bargain-hunting this week. Precisely, analyst at Afrinvest said: “Our opinion is that risks remain on the horizon due to a combination of the increasing number of COVID-19 cases in Nigeria, and weak economic conditions.
“Thus, we continue to advise investors to trade cautiously and seek trading opportunities in only fundamentally justified stocks. Although we are not optimistic of a rebound in market performance in the coming week due to poor investor sentiment, current stock prices are attractive for bargain hunting.” A review of market performance last week showed that the NSE resumed trading on a downward note on Monday, occasioned by profit-taking in bellwether stocks, as investors wealth depreciated by N119 billion. The All Share Index (ASI) shed 228.35 points or 0.91 per cent to 24,954.32 points. Accordingly, investors lost N119 billion in value as market capitalisation lost N13.018 trillion. The downturn was impacted by losses recorded in medium and large value including MTN Nigeria Communications (MTNN), BUA Cement, Zenith Bank, Ecobank Transnational Incorporated (ETI), and Guaranty Trust Bank. Capital market analysts attributed the decline to profit-taking in stocks that had gained in price, maintaining a bearish outlook during the week, as market fundamental remain susceptible to the negative effect of the COVID-19 pandemic and geo-political tensions. The market sustained the sliding profile at the end of transactions on Tuesday, as more blue-chip stocks, especially Neimeth and Prestige Assurance depreciated in price, resulting to a further slide in market capitalisation by N13 billion. Specifically, ASI slipped by 23.44 absolute points (0.09 per cent) to close at 24,930.88 points, while overall market capitalisation shed N13 billion to close at N13.005 trillion. The downturn was impacted by losses recorded in large and medium capitalised stocks, amongst which were; Flour Mills of Nigeria, MTN Nigeria Communications, Ardova Plc, C&I Leasing, and Neimeth International Pharmaceuticals. Renewed bargain-hunting in most blue-chip stocks lifted transactions at the NSE on Wednesday, causing market capitalisation to advance by N22 billion. At the close of trading, the ASI shed 42.01 absolute points or 0.17 per cent to close at 24,972.89 points. Similarly, the market capitalisation rose by N22 billion to close at N13.027 trillion. The uptrend was impacted by gains recorded in large and medium capitalised stocks, among them, Nestle Nigeria, Flour Mills of Nigeria, Cadbury Nigeria, Access Bank, and Zenith Bank.
