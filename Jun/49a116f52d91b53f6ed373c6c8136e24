The International Air Transport Association (IATA), Tuesday, released data for global air freight markets in April with Nigerian and African airlines less affected by disruptions from COVID-19.
  
Airlines in Nigeria and other African countries saw year-on-year international cargo tonne-kilometres (CTKs) fall by 20.9 per cent.
  
The small Africa-Asia market was the most resilient route in April, down only 1.0 per cent. International capacity decreased by 36.6 per cent.  North American carriers reported a fall in international demand of 20.1 per cent year-on-year in April. This was the smallest contraction of all regions. While still a significant drop, it remains less than the decline seen at the height of the Global Financial Crisis in April 2009 (-32.3 per cent). International capacity decreased by 27.7 per cent. European carriers reported a 33.8 per cent annual drop in international cargo volumes in April, much sharper than the outcome for March (-18.5 per cent). However, the large Europe-Asia market recorded less of a decline due to the rise in the movement of PPE.  International capacity decreased by 46.9 per cent.
  
Middle Eastern carriers reported a decline of 36.2 per cent year-on-year in April, significantly worse than 14.1 per cent fall in March. Despite a number of carriers in the region maintaining some cargo capacity, traffic on all key routes was low. International capacity decreased by 42.4 per cent.
  
Latin American carriers posted the sharpest fall—a 38.9 per cent year-on-year decline in international demand. International capacity decreased by 55.5 per cent. The COVID-19 crisis is particularly challenging for airlines based in Latin America owing to strict containment measures and a lack of support from Governments to keep cargo moving.
