The International Federation of Female Lawyers (FIDA), Ogun State branch, has called for the prosecution of officials of Ifo Local Government Area over the alleged assaults on a lady while trying to enforce a lockdown order in the state. FIDA said the notice came through a viral video where the agonising voice of the lady was heard claiming to have been arrested by some officials of Ifo Local Government Area enforcing the lockdown order of the state government. Chairperson of FIDA in Ogun, Mrs Kemi Osisanya, who urged that the perpetrator be prosecuted under the Ogun State Violence Against Persons Prohibition Law, noted that it would serve as a deterrent to those who might want to tow the same line. According to a statement by the public relations officer of FIDA, Taiwo Olusesi, Osisanya said the punishment would also prove that the state government is not paying lip service to the issue of gender violence. The group, which pledged its readiness to offer free legal aid to the victim, maintained that it does not support the flouting of laid down rules by anyone, but frowned on and condemned the assault on the woman, especially as it was obvious that she posed no threat to anyone. Osisanya applauded the Local Government Transition Committee chairman, Fola Salami, for acting swiftly by sanctioning all the officers on duty as of the time of the assault.
