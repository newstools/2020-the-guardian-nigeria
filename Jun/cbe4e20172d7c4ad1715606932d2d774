The festival, which ran from June 2, through June 6, 2020, in Dallas, United States of America, was screened live online, making it the first ever virtual award. Due to ravaging COVID-19 pandemic, Edochie was unable to attend the four-day festival. However, he didn’t miss anything as back home, as he followed proceedings online from his Enugu residence, and was presented with TAFF 2020 Living Legends Award Certificate by actress Patience Ozokwor popularly known as Mama G. Also, plans are underway for the festival founder and filmmaker, Kelechi Eke, to personally deliver Edochie’s trophy after the pandemic. Speaking on the choice of Edochie for the honour, Eke who’s also a software engineer, said the veteran actor deserves the honour, having contributed immensely to the development of the African film sector, in addition to bringing happiness and joy to many homes across the continent and beyond. According to him, Edochie came into prominence in the 1980s after he played the lead role of Okonkwo in an NTA adaptation of Chinua Achebe’s all-time bestselling novel, Things Fall Apart, and since then, the bearded actor has not looked back. Meanwhile, South African veteran actor and director, Dr. Jerry Mofokeng, winner of the 2006 Oscars Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, introduced Edochie as the Living Legend awardee, which featured film screenings, online workshops, training sessions, and TAFF closing awards ceremony.
