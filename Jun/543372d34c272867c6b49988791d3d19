The African Youths Initiative on Crime Prevention (AYCRIP) in partnership with the Coalition of Men against Rape and Lagos State Domestic and Sexual Violence Response Team (DSVRT) has concluded plans to stage Surulere Walk Against Rape on Saturday, June 27 at Teslim Balogun Stadium, Lagos. The walk is tagged: ‘Let us make Surulere and Coker Aguda Local Government Areas a rape-free zone in Lagos.’The founder of AYCRIP, Chris lbe, made this known in a statement made available to The Guardian yesterday. He said as an organization, the coalition is worried about the development, especially after the recent revelation by the Inspector General of Police (IGP), Mr. Mohammed Adamu, that 717 rape cases were recorded within five months in 2020 (January-May) in Nigeria. “This is a pandemic blowing up on our faces and we cannot afford to be indifferent. This is the reason our communities must stand up in defence and protection of our girl child and women. This campaign is long overdue because our men must learn and understand that women have their right to exist without fear of molestation and assault,” he said. Ibe further called on all men of good conscience, especially parents, celebrities and politicians, “to stand up against this pandemic that is fast ravaging our communities.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
