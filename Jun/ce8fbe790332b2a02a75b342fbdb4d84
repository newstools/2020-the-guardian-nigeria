Award-winning Afro-pop singer, Oluwatosin Ajibade, popularly called Mr. Eazi, has served a follow-up to his 2018 Life is Eazi Vol 2 album, with a catchy 4-tracker extended playlist dubbed One Day You Would Understand. Released under his Empawa Africa imprint, the 10-minutes compilation sound-piece revolves around adulating a woman’s beauty and expressing love interests.
  
Mr. Eazi begins the playlist with groovy Afro-RnB melodies on Baby I’m Jealous, alongside Ghanaian-based singer, Gregory Newman, a.k.a. King Promise; the duo delivered tasteful storylines on love-inspired jealousy. The playlist peaks with the follow-up Afro-Pop, I No Go Give Up On You, where Eazi reflects his vocal prowess with a storyline revolving around resolve to sustain the affection of his lover. The remaining two Afro-Pop songs, Ogogoro No Sweet Pass Pami and Baby This Your Body (abridged title), which featured Samuel Obasi, renowned as C Natty, happily decrescendos with the light-hearted mood of the project.  Still a very marketable project, One Day You Would Understand, highlights the strategic-orientation of the singer/label owner over his vocal mastery. As characterised with EPs, this is likely a prelude to a more defined and lyrically profound compilation.
