National Basketball Association (NBA) star Stephen Curry has been left impressed after seeing a one-armed Chinese boy with impressive basketball skills. Curry on Thursday, June 4, stated that he wants to locate 13-year-old Zhang Jiacheng whose dazzling basketball skills have gone viral online. “Who is this kid? Help me find him! Keep doing you and don’t let anyone tell you that you can’t,” the Golden State Warriors player wrote to his 4.5 million followers on China’s Twitter-like platform Weibo. The post was accompanied by footage of the boy outmanoeuvring his opponents with his dribbling, despite his disability.  Jiacheng was named this week by Chinese state media and the original clip of him has been viewed nearly nine million times online in China – and rising fast. Jiacheng was born in the southern province of Guangdong and lost his right arm in an accident when he was five years old, Xinhua news agency said. “Heart is always the strongest part of the body,” Xinhua quoted Chinese basketball star Yi Jianlian, formerly of the NBA, as saying after watching the clip of the teenager. Zhang Jiacheng has also been invited to visit Chinese Basketball Association champions Guangdong Southern Tigers. “This is the best kid I have ever seen playing basketball,” the team’s general manager Zhu Fangyu wrote on Weibo.
