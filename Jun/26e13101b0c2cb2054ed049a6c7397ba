Beyonce and Jay Z A Jamaican artist Dr. L’Antoinette Stines has slammed the Carters, Jay Z and Beyonce with a lawsuit, for their song “Black Effect”. According to Stines, she was never given proper credit or compensation for the song which had her as the leading voice on the track. In court documents obtained by the celebrity gossip site TMZ, Stines says she has been left feeling ‘artistically raped.’ She alleges that the power couple reached out to her in March of 2018 seeking local dancers to perform in a promotional video for a tour. Stines said in court docs that after she accomplished that task, she recorded a clip in which she talked about the concept of love at the behest of the artists. Stines claims she was told the interview would be used in the video “for promotional purposes” only and that she signed a contract giving them permission to use it for that reason. She goes on to say she was shocked when she heard “Black Effect” and realised that the interview wound up on a key portion of the track. Dr. L’Antoinette Stines | YouTube Stines says she’s renowned in Jamaica for “her artistry and wisdom” and this is why the Carters approached her. The doc claims a contract for her services was only thrust in front of her on the day of the shoot, and she alleges the Carters’ reps told her not to worry after all, her interview would only be used for promotion. In the song, which was on The Carters’ 2018 album Everything Is Love, Jay-Z begins rapping shortly after Stines is done replying to the question. She is now pissed off that she signed and never got a chance to have it reviewed by her own lawyer. Worst of all, she claims she hasn’t been paid a dime for her vocal work. Stines is seeking redress in court for copyright infringement and violation of her right to publicity plus damages. She also wants a writing credit and everything that comes with that  (meaning, cash money.)
