On Wednesday, Georgia Tennant shared the black and white photograph of herself and her daughter, Birdie which was removed. She took to her Facebook page to address this. She wrote: @facebook just removed this photo because it violated their policy on sexual images. Sort your s*** out @zuck or I’ll come round there and squirt you in the eye.” She wrote alongside the following hashtags: ”#breastfeeding #ifyouthinkthisissexualitmaybeyouthatistheissue?” Her post has garnered more than 22,000 likes and thousands of comments from people also criticising Facebook for the alleged photo ban. Some of the comments questioned Facebook’s choice: “Since when is feeding a baby sexual I don’t understand the virtual world sometimes,” commented one person. One person added that the photograph depicts “one of the most natural things a woman’s body can do” and said there was absolutely nothing wrong with it. Facebook’s policy states that most breastfeeding photos should be allowed if they do not show the mother’s nipple. It’s not the first time that someone has questioned nudity policies on social media. Last year, Miley Cyrus challenged the nudity guidelines for Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, by posting a photograph exposing her nipples. Aware of Instagram’s community guidelines, which specifically cite “some photos of female nipples” as against the rules, Cyrus said that she has been warned by the platform that her post could be removed. Georgia’s post comes after she urged women to book smear tests after her own appointment helped doctors spot her cervical cancer. In a detailed, insightful, and emotional blog post from 2018, the You, Me and Him star detailed how doctors spotted early signs and managed to remove cancer before proving fatal. From the start of seeing abnormalities in her test, in the blog post, Georgia admitted she ‘started planning her funeral’, as she shared details of her journey to promote Cervical Screening Awareness Week on Monday.
