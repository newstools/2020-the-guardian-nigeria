A cease and desist letter was given to Steve Stanulis who used to work for Kanye, after claiming he went on the Hollywood Raw Podcast last month and made false and defamatory statements about them. This serves as a breach in the confidentiality agreement he signed. In the Hollywood podcast as reported by The Mirror, Stanulis made claims that Kanye has strict rules in place which include walking 10 steps behind him in the street. He also said Kanye got angry if he blocked his paparazzi shots; He further disclosed that the rapper is his least favourite people to work with. Again, Stanulis said Kanye was the hardest worker he had ever known but also described him as the neediest, moodiest, and worst tipper. It has been disclosed that this will not be the first time the bodyguard would run into trouble with the popular rapper. He was asked to make a public apology in 2016 by Kim and Kanye after he reportedly talked about them. Stanulis publicist, ack Teperman further addressed the issue. In his words: It is unfortunate that this private matter between all parties has gotten out, however, no breach of any confidentiality agreement was done. My client went on a podcast to promote his new film 5th Borough that is set to come out June 3rd and old stories that were already out there were brought up. For Kanye and Kim’s counsel to send out anything threatening towards my client is unwarranted. Stanulis is a former NYPD officer and has appeared on TV shows including The Sopranos and I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry. When questioned about other celebrities he had worked with and are nice to him, he mentioned Toby Maguire, Matt Damon, and Alanis Morissette.
