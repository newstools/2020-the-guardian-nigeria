Abia State Coordinator of Albino Foundation, Lady Ugonwa Okeke, has decried the discrimination against albinos in the society, calling on the government to put a stop to the discriminatory act. Speaking to journalists in Umuahia, yesterday, as part of activities marking this year’s International Albinism Awareness Day, with the theme: “Made To Shine Against All Odds,” Okeke said Albinos were created by God the same way with non- Albinos, adding that they ought to live and enjoy normal lives like others. “Albinos want to marry and be married, have children, enjoy equal opportunities in employment, elective and appointive public offices, among others and not be avoided by society.” According to her, albinos are denied employment, promotions, even palliatives during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, stressing that they did not choose how they were created and how they are. The State Coordinator appealed for assistance, in form of low vision aids and telescope eyeglasses; wide-brimmed hat and umbrella; employment/empowerment; dermatological and ophthalmic screenings, vitamin supplement, flarouracim creme, operational vehicles for sensitisation, including sunscreen, sunblock with a protective factor of 50 plus, among other needs.
