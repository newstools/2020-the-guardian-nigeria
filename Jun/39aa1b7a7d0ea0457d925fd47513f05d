As Nigeria continues to record a spike in the number of confirmed cases of the coronavirus pandemic, citizens have been urged to take their personal safety seriously and reduce their exposure to others in public by engaging more in e-commerce for their trading activities. This was made known by the Executive Director of TrustPay Technologies Limited, Yemi Adebiyi, at the weekend. According to him, the community transmission of COVID-19 is spreading at an alarming rate, especially in Lagos, “but we can’t wait for the government to declare another lockdown before we take our safety seriously.” He added, “One major way of being exposed to the virus is through trading activities, but the emergence of e-commerce in Nigeria has changed the way Nigerians buy and sell goods. Although there is still some skepticism against online shopping, the advent of COVID-19 pandemic has made it imperative for sellers to diversify their sales channels to include online.” Adebiyi said his firm had unveiled AtaraPay, an online escrow service, to promote trust, transparency and protect the interest of both parties. He said the introduction of escrow service had addressed the “issue of trust between buyers and sellers in a way that promotes transparency and protects the interest of both parties. “As an escrow service, it protects the interest of both buyers and sellers by acting as a trusted third-party responsible for the collection of funds and only disburses funds when both parties are satisfied with the transaction. Their unique value proposition is that they limit the uncertainty of online sales and the risk of frauds.	” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
