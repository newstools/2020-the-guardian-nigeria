He said that the corps was also able to identify areas of strength where significant achievements were recorded and areas where gaps existed. Kazeem said that the corps had strengthened its capacity to address the identified gaps as quickly as possible. He said that the corps would also sustain the tempo and to some extent, enhance the performance in the areas where it recorded huge success. He noted that the corps was working in synergy with other security agencies through the instrumentalities of joint task force, mobile court operations and effective patrol operations. Kazeem, however, said that collaboration was key to the success of the special patrol operations, saying that the combination of the above strategies was expected to yield adequate result as expected.
