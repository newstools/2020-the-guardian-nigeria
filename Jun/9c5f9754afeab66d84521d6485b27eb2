 Adejoke Orelope-Adefulire  Describing the claims as false and mischievous, Head of Communication at OSSAP-SDGs, Janet Mcdickson, in a statement described the publication as reckless, saying they would have been wished away, but for the need to set the records straight and put an end to the allegations. “There is no N23b missing in the office, as all appropriated and released funds to the office were judiciously used in the discharge of its mandate,” it said. On the transfer of the staff member from the office, it explained that the move was the prerogative and responsibility of the office to redeploy any employee seconded to any Ministry, Department or Agency (MDA) in line with extant rules and guidelines. “It is, therefore, a misrepresentation of facts for anyone to interpret this as an attempt to cover-up any missing money. “Amazed by the allegations in the reports, the National Assembly had also debunked insinuations that the allocation to OSSAP-SDGs in the 2020 budget was padded with N33b and absolved Adejoke Orelope-Adefulire and OSSAP-SDGs of any financial impropriety,” the statement added. A statement, signed by the House Committee Chairman on SDGs, Rotimi Agunsoye had read in part, “The House Committee on SDGs got records from the OSSAP-SDGs and Appropriation committee, which shows the additional N33b was not appropriated for SDGs office among provisions of the 2020 budget earlier assented to by President Muhammadu Buhari.” The OSSAP-SDGs restated its commitment to discharging its core mandate, including the fight against corruption and promised not to bow to pressure and distractions in achieving the SDGs in Nigeria. It advised members of the public to disregard the misleading publications whose objective is to malign the office and spread falsehood.
