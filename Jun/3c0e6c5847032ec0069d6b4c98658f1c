Coronavirus PHOTO:dowell / Getty Images Sex in your house with someone from outside of your household is set to become illegal today in England as part of the measures put in place to curtail coronavirus. This comes after rules that prevent people from socialising or gathering with one person from outside of their household in a private space. The new legislation explicitly bans being inside the house in a gathering of more than one person without a reasonable excuse according to a report by The Mirror. People who may be deemed to have a reasonable excuse are sports professionals, people attending funerals, vulnerable persons fleeing a risk of violence, carers, and those with unavoidable work commitments. For those attending a funeral of a loved one, rules encompass staying overnight to attend a funeral as a member of the deceased person’s household or a close family member of the deceased person. Others who are exceptions to the new rule are those moving houses and people who need to obtain medical assistance. The UK has seen a shocking rise in domestic violence crimes during the lockdown and the new measures take this onboard permitting anyone who must escape the risk of harm to sleep at someone’s house. The UK Government has pledged to review guidelines on the clinically extremely vulnerable as part of each review of social distancing measures for the wider population. Reacting to the new rules, charities are demanding the Government makes public the evidence on which it has based its decision for the lockdown change, saying it has come “out of the blue” and “adds to the impression already created that the shielding group isn’t high enough on its list of priorities”. Anyone contravening the regulations can be subject to a £100 Fixed Penalty Notice, halved to £50 if paid within 14 days.
