Shareholders of the African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank) yesterday re-elected a Nigerian, Prof. Benedict Oramah, as president of the Pan-African multilateral financial institution for a second term of five years. A statement yesterday from the bank’s headquarters in Cairo said the re-election took place during the organisation’s 27th yearly general meeting in the Egyptian capital city. It added that the feat was followed by an acceptance speech where Oramah told the stakeholders that the bank’s priority in his fresh term was the realisation of Africa’s strategic ambition to create an integrated market. “We want an Africa where the foundations of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA) are laid expeditiously so that the 84,000 kilometres of borders that have divided us for ages can begin to come down,” he stated.
