No longer comfortable with the bloodletting and destruction of properties in Taraba Central and South, the state governor, Darius Ishaku, has directed that security be beefed up in communities targeted by militias. He also directed security agencies in the state to go after members of the militias responsible for the ongoing attacks and killings in the state. Aside his interest in the prosecution of militia gangsters terrorising the state, Ishaku’s directive for security beef up was to guarantee the safety of lives and properties in the state. The governor, who gave the directive yesterday in Jalingo through his deputy, Haruna Manu, warned the attackers to seek alternative means of livelihoods or relocate from the state. He said, “The state government is greatly dismayed by the recent attacks by militia groups on Maigoge and Tunga in Bali Council of the state resulting in the death of innocent people. “During the attacks, many houses were burnt, including those of a village head and a youth leader. These attacks came only a few days after the killing, also by a militia group, of a pastor of CRC-N Church in Mararaba, Donga Council, Emmanuel Bileya, and his wife, Juliana, while they were working on their farm. “Government condemns in very strong terms these barbaric attacks on individuals and communities in the state and warns the attackers to desist forthwith.” According to him, Taraba government is determined not only to stop the militia attacks but to ensure lasting peace among the various groups in communities of central and southern Taraba. While appealing to well-meaning citizens in the state to support the on-going peace efforts, Ishaku stressed that his administration would tread all legitimate paths to accomplish the aforementioned tasks.
