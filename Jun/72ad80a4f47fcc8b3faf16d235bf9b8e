He suggested December 2020 as a definite time-frame for conclusion of all electoral reform, and canvassed a massive mobilisation of citizens to promote the reform at the local, state and national levels. Also speaking, the Chief Press Secretary to INEC Chairman, Rotimi Oyekanmi, listed the eight entities connected to electoral reform to include: INEC, political parties, Civil Society Organisations, registered voters, judiciary, security agencies, media and development partners. ECES Coordination Advisor/Electoral Administration Expert, Manji Wilson, said: “A lot has been done. However, a lot more still needs to be done.
