Many of them contracted the disease while reporting from streets, markets and hospitals on the effects of the virus, without proper protective equipment, Lainez said. “They have gone to hospitals, which are foci of infection, with homemade masks,” she said. Seven of the victims were from Loreto, in the Amazon basin, one of Peru’s worst affected areas. A large proportion of journalists who fell victim to the virus were freelancers, with none of the protections afforded to company employees. “Journalists dying from COVID-19 confirms the urgency of addressing health protection and job insecurity,” the union said.
