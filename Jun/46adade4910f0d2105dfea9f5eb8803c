The Presidency yesterday claimed that a top security agency in the country had uncovered a plot by the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) to ignite a war in Nigeria, “using false allegations of prosecution against Christians.” A statement by the Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity to the President, Garba Shehu, did not name the security apparatus, but warned Nigerians to be wary of “divisive campaigns funded by foreigners.” However, the presidency said its conclusion was based on “a very deep and wide investigation” by the agency working in collaboration with international partners. It said the foreign associates had already informed the authorities that there were two interconnected campaigns being run concurrently by the IPOB in this regard. The statement read: “Both are using the cover of Christianity and calling for a U.S. Special Envoy to be appointed to stop the ‘genocide’ of Christians in Nigeria. But the real purpose is to drive a wedge between the Nigerian government and its U.S. and UK/European allies. “IPOB leadership of course self-proclaims as ‘Jewish’, a position not shared by the generality of the members. “For reasons of convenience, he (Nnamdi Kanu) claims to have an interest in the welfare of Christians ­– but this is a ruse: the case for independence, the leader believes, is strengthened by ‘proving’ the government of Nigeria is ‘autocratic’, engaged in a ‘silent slaughter’ of their own citizens along with religion and ethnic lines – and, that therefore, the only viable option for the unique religious and ethnic minority is a sovereign Biafra separate from Nigeria.” It added: “Nigerians and the international community are advised to be wary of this divisive campaign, which available evidence shows is being funded with monthly spending of $85,000 since October 2019, with no records of the source of this largesse.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
