…Why high cost of oil production may persist
…IOCs, industry players bemoan insecurity, multiple taxes Stakeholders have raised concerns over the country’s production costs, noting that Nigeria has the highest personnel cost among global operators, thus making it difficult to produce oil at a profitable price of below $10/barrel.
   
According to them, many operators in the country spend 50 per cent of their cash flow on personnel costs, thus accounting for why some still produce at a high rate of $93/barrel, in a low oil price regime.
   
However, representatives of the international and indigenous oil companies expressed concerns about the sustainability of achieving the $10/barrel production cost, considering costs incurred from vandalism of crude oil assets like pipelines, and security costs from protecting oil barges.
   
Indeed, Nigeria’s bid to reduce the production cost in the face of volatile prices, trade war as well as challenges posed by COVID-19, may remain elusive unless the country addresses critical issues.    Speaking during a webinar on, “Strategies the Oil and Gas Industry: Need to Survive and Thrive Post-COVID-19 Crisis,” the stakeholders said prevailing situation such as insecurity, high cost of personnel, multiple taxes and other challenges could frustrate oil revenue in the country.  “There is nowhere any company will spend 50 per cent of its cash flow on human resources and survive. It is not possible,” Kyari said, adding that the oil business may shutdown especially if the price of oil goes below $30/barrel for a long time.
   
Although Kyari said the Corporation would retain all its workers and may not cut salaries, but he said the decision would depend on increased revenue and realistic cost. Should the cost remain high; Kyari noted that Nigeria wouldn’t have tax revenue, except royalty, a situation that would impact both federal and state governments’ ability to finance their budgets.  Auwalu said while Covid-19 has become the new normal, it demands improved working environment and processes, and the need for business reposition.
   
He stated that cost control and management were key, as well as business efficiency, financial stewardship, better negotiation of contract, improved corporate governance, vertical integration model, improvement in refineries, operational excellence, compliance, asset optimization and others. Auwalu believes the government has a critical role to play, especially in policy and regulation, business environment and investment drive as well as creating an opportunity for lower cost of production.
   
Similarly, representative of the International Oil Companies (IOCs) and Managing Director of Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (SNEPCo), Bayo Ojulari, and ingenious player, the Managing Director, First Oil Exploration Limited, and Chairman, Independent Petroleum Producers Group, Ademola Adeyemi-Bero, expressed worry over the sustainability of the projected reduction in production cost.  As critical as cost reduction is, he called for policy incentives, improved government and private investors’ collaboration as well as total synergy among players. While the country has been struggling to get value locally from its gas resources, a sector which enables other local industries to thrive, Ojulari said there was a need to deregulate price of gas, to allow a willing-buyer-willing-seller situation.
