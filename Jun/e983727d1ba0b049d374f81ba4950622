The groups include Ibi Giga Ambassadors, Ibigiga Aketi Advocacy Group,among others. The N22.5 million cheque was jointly presented to the governor on behalf of the groups by Lucky Ayedatiwa, Alex Ajipe, Oladunni Odu and the wife of the governor, Betty, who was represented by the state’s Commissioner for Women Affairs. Akeredolu, who noted that the cost of the forms were too expensive, said he had told his friends that he could not afford the price for the forms. While appreciating the groups for the gesture, he gave the assurance that bitumen and the Ondo deep seaport would begin soon. He expressed uncertainty on the mode of the July 20, 2020 APC primary election, saying: “Whichever mode, we are  not afraid of any type of primary.
