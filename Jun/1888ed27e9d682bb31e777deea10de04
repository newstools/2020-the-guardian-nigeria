As civil servants from grade level 13 resume work today after over two months of lockdown, the Lagos State Commissioner for Establishments, Training and Pensions, Mrs. Ajibola Ponnle, has stated that the state government is committed to building a 21st workforce that will deliver the dividends of democracy to Lagosians across every area of human needs by directing its training and capacity development programmes to both generic and technical areas of competency.  
 
The Commissioner disclosed this during the Year 2020 Ministerial Press Briefing organised as part of activities to commemorate the first year in office of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, noting that one of the notable achievements and innovations to training programmes under the present administration is the introduction of online learning programmes, starting with Webinar series, which had ensured that the capacity of the entire workforce was developed even during the period of state-wide lockdown order. “Within the past few months the Webinar initiative started, 11 different series has been held. There was also a virtual launch of the pilot of the Lagos State Learning Management System (LMS) with over 10,000 members of staff uploaded, giving access to over 500 training courses.” The launch of the Learning Management System and the various Webinar series, Ponnle said, were aimed at achieving a paradigm shift from learning being an event to being a continuous process thereby building a workforce that is equipped with relevant skills, knowledge and competencies to deliver the dividends of democracy to the teeming population of the state. According to her, the Lagos State Public Service Staff Development Centre (PSSDC) Magodo being the training Centre established specifically for the training of government officials also keyed into the virtual training initiative as a result of the COVID-19 lockdown and suspension of physical training courses.
