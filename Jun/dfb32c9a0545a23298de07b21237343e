Akwa Ibom State Governor Udom Emmanuel has commended the state House of Assembly as well as the Ninth National Assembly members for the exceptional co-operation that existed between the two arms of government in the past one year. He gave the commendation as the lawmakers prepare to celebrate their one year in office after the 2019 general elections. In a statement signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Ekerete Udoh, the governor said: “In the past one year, as was in our first term, you have been keen partners in the execution of the mandate bestowed on us by our people to work for their collective interest and general well-being. This has resulted in the harmonious working relationship we have enjoyed in the last one year.

I look forward to deepening our co-operation in the coming years as we work to leave legacies that would stand the test of time. Congratulations to you all.” Similarly, the governor also congratulated the Akwa Ibom State contingent to the Ninth National Assembly, saying: “I wish to salute and congratulate you for being fantastic legislative ambassadors of our people at the National Assembly and for working to advance the interest of our people.
