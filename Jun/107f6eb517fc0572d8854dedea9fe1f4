The Nigerian Government on Monday said it is considering the enforcement of lockdown in 18 local governments in the country. Chairman of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19, Boss Mustapha, made the disclosure during the daily briefing in Abuja. Although Mustapha did not mention the states where the local governments are located but said the areas account for 60 per cent of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Nigeria in the next phase of eased lockdown in the country. Mustapha said affected state governments would implement what he described as ‘precision lockdown.’ While noting that the nation has not reached the peak of coronavirus infection as far as confirmed cases were concerned, he urged all stakeholders to ensure compliance with all non-pharmaceutical interventions. He also gave an insight into the reason behind the low fatality rate in Nigeria, saying 80% of the infections are in the age bracket of 31 to 40 years. More details soon.
