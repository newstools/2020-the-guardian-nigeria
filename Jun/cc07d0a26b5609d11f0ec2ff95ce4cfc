She died on Tuesday and the death was announced the next day by her TV colleagues, who hailed her as a ‘brilliant storyteller and a force of nature’. Waters contributed to 18 episodes of the hit NBC drama during 2018 and 2019 and stars of the show including Mandy Moore have paid tribute to her ‘beautiful spirit’. The Los Angeles County Medical Examiner-Coroner’s office gave the manner of her death as a suicide. Waters had last posted on Twitter on May 8, saying, some things just change you. She had previously voiced fears on social media that ‘so many people suffer in silence, or their symptoms go ignored’ because of a ‘stigma’ around mental health. On Thursday, Reese Witherspoon revealed that Waters also had a connection to her production company Hello Sunshine. On Wednesday, the writers at This Is Us posted a tweet on their official Twitter and said ‘The entire #ThisIsUs family was devastated to learn of Jas Waters passing’. They wrote: In our time together, Jas left her mark on us and ALL over the show. She was a brilliant storyteller and a force of nature. We send our deepest sympathies to her loved ones. She was one of us. RIP @jasfly. Also, This is Us, creator, Dan Fogelman, expressed his sadness via twitter where he wrote: This news took my breath away. Jas was absolutely brilliant and had so many stories still to tell. She made an indelible mark on our show and my heart breaks for her loved ones. RIP @JasFly. Jas Waters started her career as a journalist, writing a column for Vibe and starting her own website before she was cast in The Gossip Game, a show about bloggers covering the hip-hop industry. She got her start as a TV writer on VH1’s The Breaks and Hood Adjacent with James Davis in 2017, before joining the This Is Us writers room in its second season. Waters received a story credit on the 2019 movie What Men Want, a gender-flipped remake of Mel Gibson’s What Women Want, starring Taraji P. Henson
