Kano State Governor Abdullahi Ganduje has insisted that dethroned Emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi II, has not been left off the hook of the alleged N2.2 billion land scam. He said the recent ruling of a Federal High Court in Kano cleared all legal obstacles for the state’s anti-graft commission to try Sanusi over his involvement in the alleged racketeering of government property. Fielding questions from newsmen yesterday during an interaction at the Government House to mark Democracy Day, Ganduje insisted that the 14th emir still had case to answer. The governor further disclosed that Sanusi was deposed because of his resistance to accommodate additional four emirates constituted to spread development across other domains. “Let me state clearly that our new emirates have come to stay. We deliberately created additional emirates to spread development and ensure even distribution of social facilities across the state. This is a system our government believed and committed to achieve. But the former emir needed to find his way out to complete the system. “Again, the legal action instituted by Sanusi and the so-called Kano elders has also slowed down government reforms on the new emirates. We thank God the recent court ruling has cleared the way. The anti-corruption agency is also free to trial Sanusi,” Ganduje declared.
