The 55-year-old Matrix star’s prize was valued at $10,000 and has already exceeded the value with an anonymous bid of $10,100. Starting with the description of the prize, that is Keanu Reeves, the introduction said: A Little One-on-One with Keanu Bill & Ted. Speed. The Matrix. John Wick. You know him. You love him. This is truly priceless and now you have the chance to Zoom with him from home! Get your questions ready and spend 15-minutes with actor, director, producer and musician, Keanu Reeves. Camp Rainbow Gold is holding various other auctions as well, including, a 15-minute Zoom concert with Ally Brooke who is from Fifth Harmony, and a guitar signed by Andy Grammer. Keanu Reeves is concerned a lot about his privacy, in an interview with Entertainment Tonight back in 2016, he said: Privacy is really important to me, and yeah, I don’t really have anything to say about anything. The Matrix star with a net worth of $360M, according to Forbes in 2019, last gave major insight into his private life when he went public with his girlfriend, Alexandra Grant last year. In action thriller Speed 1994, in which Reeves was cast as a police officer, he was able to garner critical and commercial success and this made Reeves gain further recognition. Reeves supports several charities and causes. In response to his sister’s battle with leukemia, he founded a private cancer foundation, which aids children’s hospitals and provides cancer research. He has also volunteered for a Stand Up to Cancer telethon and worked closely with animal rights group PETA. Reeves has stated: Money is the last thing I think about. I could live on what I have already made for the next few centuries
