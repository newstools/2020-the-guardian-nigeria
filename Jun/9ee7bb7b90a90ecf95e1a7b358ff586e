A 22-year-old vulcaniser, Dele Ope, has been arrested by men of the Ogun State police command for stealing the underwear of her client. The suspect was arrested following a report by a woman (name withheld) who reported at Warewa division that she discovered that her car tyre had been deflated when she wanted to drive out, which was the reason she invited the suspect to fix the tyre for her. After fixing the tyre, she discovered that her pant that was spread on a rope within the compound was missing. Since the vulcaniser was the only person who came to the compound, she went round in search of him but he was nowhere to be found. Upon the report, the Divisional Police Officer of Warewa division, Folake Afeniforo, detailed detectives to the area where the suspect was traced and arrested. His house was quickly searched and the womanâ€™s pant was recovered. On interrogation, the suspect confessed to stealing the underwear with the intention of taking it to an herbalist for money-making ritual. The Commissioner of Police, Kenneth Ebrimson, has ordered that the suspect be charged to court as soon as investigation is concluded.
