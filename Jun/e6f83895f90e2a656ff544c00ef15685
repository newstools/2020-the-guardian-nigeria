Woman Smashes Plane Window After Failed Relationship Image Mirror A furious woman smashed a plane window mid-flight after reportedly becoming upset over her failed relationship. 29-year old Li forced an emergency landing after the pilot of Loong Airlines Flight 8528 made an unscheduled stop at Zhengzhou Xinzheng International Airport, which is in the capital of Henan Province in Central China according to the Mirror. Airport authorities said Li lost control of her emotions” on the flight on 25th May, with footage showing her crying in her seat while cabin crew and passengers try to restrain her. She was dumped by her lover, and Zhengzhou police said she drank half a litre of the Chinese grain alcohol known as ‘baijiu’, which has an alcohol volume of between 35 to 60 percent. Li drank two 250-millilitre bottles of baijiu prior to boarding the flight, which had taken off from Xining, capital of Qinghai Province in north-western China, bound for the coastal city of Yancheng in Jiangsu Province in East China, the authorities noted. Footage from the aircraft shows flight attendants attempting to move Li her from her seat as she cries and punches the window next to her, cracking open the first layer. However, the Airbus A320 touched down in Zhengzhou without further issue, and no one was harmed during the mid-air scare. She was arrested subsequently for a public order offense and detained. Her blood alcohol content was measured at 160 mg / 100 ml, according to Zhengzhou police, who did not say how long she was remanded for, or whether she would be fined for damage caused to the aircraft.
