Despite unmet metering gaps to over six million customers/households, some electricity Distribution Companies (DisCos) have begun to inform customers that tariff will rise from July 1, following approval from the regulator and the Nigerian Government.
  
With over six million Nigerian households still facing estimated billing, according to the latest data from the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC), consumers will have to contend with additional costs from the increased price of prepaid meters over naira devaluation and new electricity tariff.
   
According to NERC’s quarterly report for the fourth quarter (Q4) of 2019, inadequate metering remains a serious challenge in the industry, with only 3,918,322 (37.77%) of the total customer population of 10,374,597 are metered.  “Following the directive of the Nigerian Electrical Regulatory Commission (NERC), with the approval of the Federal Government, on the planned electricity tariff review which will take effect on July 1, 2020, the Enugu Electricity Distribution Company (EEDC), wishes to notify her esteemed customers of this development,” said a notice from EEDC.  “However, there will be no tariff increase for those customers that have low level of supply and lower service quality. This is consistent with the feedback received from customers during the stakeholders’ consultations for extraordinary tariff review application organised by EEDC and NERC respectively in February and March this year,” EEDC said.
