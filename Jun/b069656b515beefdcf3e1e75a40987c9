Remove term: Federal House of Representatives Federal House of Representatives PHOTO: Twitter The House of Representatives has resolved to beam its searchlights on the management of Nigeria Police force Pension limited for allegedly misusing billions of Naira at its disposal. The decision was precipitated by the alleged inability of the pension fund to live up to its responsibility of paying pension and gratuities to retired police officers as at when due. Adopting a motion of urgent public importance sponsored by Mr Ali Adeyemi Taofeek the House directed its Committee on Police Affairs to probe into the issue and report back to the House for further legislative action. Moving the motion, Taofeek warned against the maltreatment of retired police officers which could worsen the security situation in the country. The lawmaker claimed that scores of police retirees had been protesting to the police hierarchy about the reduction of their entitlements while others have since joined the bandwagon of pensioners who donâ€™t receive their monthly pensions and gratuities in full and as at when due. He thereby warned that the retired officers who are being short-changed after their services to the nation may resort to taking advantage of the loopholes in the security architecture of the country to perpetrate mischief for pecuniary gains to feed their families. He disclosed that employers pension contributions of N15.8 billion, N16.6 billion, N16.6 billion and N19.7 billion were paid by the Federal Government from 2015 to 2019 respectively to the NPF Pension Limited as government contributions. He expressed concerned that despite the PENCOM regulatory supervision, there are various pending fraud cases currently in court instituted by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) against officials of NPF Pension Limited.
