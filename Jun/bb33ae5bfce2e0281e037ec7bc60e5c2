The court sentenced Ubong Isaiah to death for armed robbery while Williams Udoh was sentenced to a separate 21 years imprisonment for rape at the scene of the crime. The two robbers were earlier arraigned by the Lagos State Government on an amended five-count charge in June 2017. The defendants, who pleaded not guilty, robbed the residents of Ologun and Darashe, a street in Shepherd Estate, Ijegun on the 2nd of August 2015 while the 1st defendant William Udoh raped one of the victims on her matrimonial bed.

The lead prosecutor, permanent secretary in Lagos State Ministry of Justice, Titilayo Shitta urged the court to sentence the defendants accordingly having found them guilty of the charges against them. She noted that the testimonies of six witnesses including the victim of rape and armed robbery confirmed the allegations of the crime against Udoh and Isiah. The trial judge, Hon. Justice Atinuke Ipaye stated that the evidence provided by the prosecutor’s witnesses was credible, compelling, and cogent to the ground the conviction of the defendants. Justice Ipaye found the two robbers guilty of the charge and punishable under section 261, 297 and 295 (2) of the Criminal Law, CH, C.17 Vol 13 Laws of Lagos State 2015. “You are hereby sentenced to death on the counts of conspiracy to commit robbery and armed robbery while the first defendant William Udoh is further sentenced to 21years imprisonment for the offence of rape,” Justice Ipaye ruled.
