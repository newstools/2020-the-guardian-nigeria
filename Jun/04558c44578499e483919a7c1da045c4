The National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) yesterday said the suspended 2020 Batch ‘A’ Stream One orientation course, which was suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic, would be completed when it gets the green light from the Presidential Task Force (PTF). The 21-day programme was halted just after one week as a proactive measure to check the spread of the virus in all orientation camps across the federation. NYSC Director-General, Brigadier General Shuaibu Ibrahim, dropped the hint during a courtesy visit to his Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) counterpart, Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu, in Abuja. He said conscious of the possibility of complete lifting of the lockdown, the strategies mapped out by the NYSC management had taken care of various scenarios and would be presented to the PTF through the NCDC for guidance. In his response, Ihekweazu commended the scheme for its support at fighting the disease. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
