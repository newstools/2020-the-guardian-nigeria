Plans To Involve Other Agencies For Retirement Training Three hundred and forty-two personnel from the Armed Forces have passed out of the Nigerian Armed Forces Resettlement Centre (NAFRC), after six months of intensive training. The Commandant of NAFRC, AVM Kingsley Lar, who disclosed this during a symbolic Passing Out Parade (POP) for personnel passing out in line with the guidance for the Coronavirus pandemic, in NAFRC, Oshodi-Lagos, said the centre is planning to involve members of other security and paramilitary agencies, as well as selected civilian staff of Federal Government Ministries, Departments and Agencies in vocational training meant to prepare them for future endeavours. Lar revealed that there was need to provide a meaningful forum for the cross-sectional exchange of ideas, improve civil military interactions with an overriding commitment to exchanging smooth resettlement. “When I resumed in January, I discovered the need to integrate other agencies and civilian staff to enable military retirees make friends from other agencies outside their core areas of competence, so as to help them live a normal life after retirement,” he said. The commandant said the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic hindered some aspects of the activities lined up for the course, but the guideline provided by the Presidential Task Force and the orders of the Defence Headquarters resulted in a symbolic graduation ceremony, which enabled 65 retirees to be present out of 342. The Deputy Commandant, Maj. Gen M.O Ebendu, charged the retirees to always remain good ambassadors of the Armed Forces, enjoining them to apply the skills learnt from the centre.Master Warrant Officer and the overall best graduating student, Anyanwu Vitalis Emeribe, said determination and extra efforts made him outstanding.
