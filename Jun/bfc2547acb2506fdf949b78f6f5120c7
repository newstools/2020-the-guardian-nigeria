Nigerian singer Peter Okoye better known by the stage name Mr P has revealed that he and his family members tested positive for coronavirus. Okoye who has now recovered from the virus disclosed during an Instagram live video, that his wife Lola Omotayo, his daughter Aliona, as well as two of his domestic staff, had contracted the virus earlier this month. “For the past three weeks, I have been ill and most people didn’t even know what was wrong with me. I kept it to myself. It has been three weeks of hell for me and my family. I had COVID-19 for about three weeks and it happened to me. I was sick and I tested positive.” Peter Okoye and wife, Lola Okoye described the experience as “hell for this family”. “After a week, my daughter caught the virus as well. It was sad that when she caught it, the doctor insisted that she has to be self-isolated in her own room but my wife did something very courageous. She said no. “I was sick and I was being self-isolated in my guest room. I couldn’t even see my sick daughter and I was feeling so bad. I felt so bad because I felt that I am the one who actually brought the virus to the house. It was so bad that I had to be calling her on video, checking on her. “The next day, my wife did something very courageous. She picked our daughter from her room, held her and took her to the master bedroom and she called me and she started crying. I asked her what happened and she said I cannot live this girl alone. I would rather be infected and be with her.” “Five or six days later, my daughter was pronounced negative. When she was pronounced negative, we knew it wasn’t going to end there. The next day, Lola became positive. It has been hell but we had a bad experience. I am happy to announce that my wife, myself, our daughter and two of our domestic staff all of us are now negative.”
