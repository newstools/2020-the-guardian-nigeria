Disturbed by the rising cases of rape amid the COVID-19 pandemic in the country, the National Agency for Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP) has called for the naming and shaming of sexual offenders to stem the menace. Its Public Enlightenment Director, Arinze Orakwue and other panellists, during a webinar discussion hosted by Plan International Nigeria’s Girls, Get Equal activists, lamented that aside the shaming culture of rape survivors in the country, the lack of meting out appropriate punishment to perpetrators was further deepening the agony of victims. Orakwue, who spoke on “Life After Rape: Survivors’ Right to Care, Support and Justice”, canvassed stiffer punitive measures. Other members of the panel discussion, moderated by Murna Fattih Akyok, were Evangeline Dan Yusuf, Kennedy Shaiyen, and Salmah Abdulhamid Buba.
