Worried by the worsening insecurity in their region, governors of the 19 northern states, under the auspices of the Northern States’ Governors’ Forum (NSGF), have decided to explore local solutions, including hunters and vigilantes, to stem the tide.
  
Rising from their virtual meeting on Thursday night, the governors resolved to set up a standing committee on security to foster a synergy between security agencies and local groups for the proper enforcement of appropriate measures to secure the region.
  
The meeting, which was presided over by NSGF Chairman, Plateau State Governor Simon Bako Lalong, also set up another committee on consultation with traditional, religious and community leaders, headed by Lalong, with a view to ensuring wider stakeholder involvement in tackling insecurity in the region.  While commending Nigeria’s security forces for their efforts so far in tackling insecurity in the region, the northern governors called for increased synergy to further enhance their operations and assist in putting an end to the activities of bandits, insurgents, kidnappers and other criminals.  “We commend President Muhammadu Buhari for his efforts to deal with the security situation in the country and the region,” the governors stated.
