The Borno State Government said it has engaged 3,311 youths and approved about N108.13 million as takeoff grants for traders and physically challenged persons.
According to the Commissioner of Sports, Youths and Empowerment (SYEP), Sainna Buba, at an inter-ministerial briefing in Maiduguri, the youths, under the auspices of various trade groups were drawn from the Maiduguri Metropolitan Council, and Jere. He said that the youths were affected by losing their means of livelihoods during the decade long Boko Haram insurgency in the state. “With the inauguration of Governor Babagana Zulum last year, on the platform of the All Progressive Congress (APC), many youths lost their means of livelihoods like trading, vulcanizing, farming and water vending. “The Governor directed me to identify youths in each of the 30 wards for intervention to reduce the rate of unemployment in the state. “The Governor also empowered 1,037 vulnerable blind men and women with N30,000 each. They were also trained in various skills, including cap making, tailoring and other trades that could fully engage them in various economic activities.” He added that 461 traders at the Bama Motor Park were also provided with a takeoff grant of N13.83 million, while 924 youths from other locations were empowered with N21.95 million.
