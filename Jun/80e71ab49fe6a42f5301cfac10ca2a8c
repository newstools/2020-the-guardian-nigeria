Oyo State government said it had recorded another new 68 COVID-19 cases in the state. Governor Seyi Makinde, who is the head of the state’s COVID-19 task force, disclosed this in a series of tweets. He said: “Nine confirmed COVID-19 cases have received their second negative test results and have been discharged. This brings the number of discharged cases in Oyo State to 280. “Also, the COVID-19 confirmation tests for 68 suspected cases came back positive. So, the total number of confirmed cases in Oyo State today is 575.” Meanwhile, reactions have continued to trail the plan of the state government to reopen schools on June 29, 2020. But against this backdrop, stakeholders have expressed differing views on the plan. President of the National Association of Proprietors of Private Schools (NAPPS), Mr. Kayode Adeyemi, lauded the governor for taking the step, noting that the reopening was a step in the right direction. On the flip side, the Oyo State Chairman of the Nigeria Union of Teachers (NUT), Mr. Tojuade Adedoye, urged caution on the directive, saying: “The directive to reopen schools is contrary to that of the National Committee on COVID-19, which directed that all educational institutions must remain closed for now. Also speaking, the Director of the Education Advancement Centre (EAC), Pastor Muyiwa Bamgbose, said: “We are stakeholders and I believe the government must have facts that we may not have. Ordinarily, one will say that there should be caution to protect lives of children and teachers, and by extension, their families.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
