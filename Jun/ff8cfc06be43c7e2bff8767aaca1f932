To reduce the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on its Agent Network, One of Nigeria betting companies, Betking has donated over N100 million to its Agents across the country. In the global sports industry, the impact of the COVID-19 has significantly influenced the closure of businesses. Prior to the recent re-opening of some sporting events, several sport industry related companies experienced cash flow disruptions during the lockdowns. Many even teetering on the brink of complete shutdown which would affect livelihoods of their employees and families. According to the firm, the donation is in line with its values of a family-oriented culture, teamwork and collective engagement. Employees, inspired by the organizations gesture rallied together to make contributions to the fund through their Adopt and Agent Initiative. BetKings’ donations complemented by the Adopt and Agent initiative donations, impacted over 8000 agents across the country. According to the Chief Opportunity Officer, Neil Bothma,  overseeing the Agent network, “through this initiative, we embodied the Kingmaker spirit of improving the lives of those we encounter, and we are happy to have the opportunity to pour into the lives of our Agents. We know our donation is just a drop in the ocean; every bit helps”. “Our agents sent testimonials of how the financial donations provided some succor during the challenging period and that it helped others reopen their shops as the lockdown was eased. BetKing agents hire at least two people per store, therefore supporting the Agent network is very important.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
