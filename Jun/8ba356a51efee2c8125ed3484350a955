The governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) during 2019 general elections in Oyo State, Chief Bayo Adelabu, yesterday, alleged the state had retrogressed under Governor Seyi Makinde in the last one year. Adelabu disclosed this while speaking on the affairs of the state for the first time, since he lost the elections. He spoke to an Ibadan-based radio station. Adelabu said though it would be unfair to compare Makinde’s one year in office to Abiola Ajimobi’s eight years, the current administration had done nothing tangible. Speaking on building on the legacies left by Ajimobi, the APC chieftain said: “In terms of security, we have been seeing pockets of crimes, car-snatching, robberies, and others. That did not happen in Ajimobi’s eight years. “We have seen the return of miscreants: Ekugbemi vs Ebila…. Rape cases in Oyo State have increased. There is no nightlife in Oyo State anymore, because people now live in fear. This began even before COVID-19 started…” He said the recent re-commissioning of the Closed-Circuit Television  (CCTV) security project that Ajimobi had earlier commissioned was because Makinde did not have anything tangible to the commission. He said he was not disappointed by Makinde’s performance because “what we are seeing is the result of sudden and unexpected victory of their party.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
