Women in Energy Network (WIEN), has decried the exclusion of women in the newly reconstituted board of Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), despite there being many female executives in the oil industry with the requite experience, skill and competence.
 
President of WIEN, Funmi Ogbue, who raised the concern in a statement, in Lagos, posited that it is instructive to note that even among the 2016 board members whose three-year term just expired, none of the six was a woman.
 
According to her, many national oil companies and even those in the most-conservative climes now understand the need to increase the number of women in leadership positions in the energy sector, while Nigeria is yet to effect such gesture in the nations’ oil sector.  WIEN, however, thanked the President for committing at several fora to ensure that more women are given opportunities within his government. This, WIEN stated, was evident in the number of high-profile female appointees in the current administration since the start of the first year in the second term of the administration. Some of the notable appointments include Zainab Ahmed as Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning; Pauline Tallen, Women Affairs and Social Development; Sadiya Umar-Farouk, Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management; Minister of State for Transport, Senator Gbemisola Saraki; Sharon Ikeazu, Environment; Maryam Katagun, Industry, Trade and Investment, among others.
