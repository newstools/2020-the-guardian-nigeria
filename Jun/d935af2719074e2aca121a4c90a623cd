Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria (HURIWA) has urged the Inspector General of Police (IGP), Mohammed Adamu, does not end like some high profile cases that were hijacked by the authorities and swept under the carpet. It was reacting to the take over of the prosecution of Hamisu Bala (alias Wadume) by the Attorney General and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami.To bid to arrest the suspected kidnapping gangster led to the killing of three well-trained police investigators in Taraba State. HURIWA recalled that on Wednesday, Shuaibu Labaran, a lawyer from the Ministry of Justice, had told the Federal High Court, Abuja division, which was handling the matter, that the AGF had taken over the matter. The National Coordinator, Emmanuel Onwubiko, and the National Media Affairs Director, Zainab Yusuf, stated yesterday in Abuja, “This is a delay tactic, which is a grave threat to justice and fairness, because the families of the three police detectives killed by soldiers on the alleged orders of Capt. Ahmed Balarabe, have not got the swift justice that they deserve constitutionally by seeing that the suspects are swiftly prosecuted and punished severely for this heinous crime.” Arguing that the take over of the matter by the AGF, who began badly by praying the court for a short adjournment, was absolutely suspicious because of insinuations that the case might suffer the fate of other sensitive corruption cases in the hands of the AGF. Some of the cases were reportedly withdrawn from the court of law in ‘politically-negotiated settlements’. “HURIWA is absolutely against these delay tactics and the fact that the Nigerian government has yet to arrest all the suspects and the accusation that the major culprit has been sent on the military course does not seat well in the conscience of the nation and is offensive to the core soul of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
