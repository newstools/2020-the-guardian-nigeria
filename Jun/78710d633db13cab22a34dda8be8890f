The event, which was put together by FT Cycle Care, saw about 30 cyclists, who observed the social distancing rules, riding from Fadeyi through National Stadium, Iponri, Airport Road, and a brief stop over at the Lagos State Government House, Alausa to display the theme of the event, which is “Ride
Against COVID-19, before riding back to Fadeyi. Speaking at the event, Chief Executive Officer, FT Cycle Care, Femi Thomas, said his organisation in conjunction with the Nigeria Cycling Federation (NCF) and the Lagos State government, decided to mark the world Cycling Day even with the COVID-19 restriction to reiterate the usefulness of keeping healthy in the fight against the deadly Coronavirus or any other disease. “We are using this day to break the chain of COVID-19. “The United Nations use every third day of June to canvass the advantages of riding bicycle to healthy living and also as a means of transportation and sporting activity. “The cyclists are also using the World Bicycle Day to create more awareness on the need to participate in cycling. Cycling, apart from recreation and transportation, also creates employment for some individuals. “The government should also help in providing good road networks that would help cyclists ride safely on Nigerian roads. Cycling is a sport that every age strata in the society can involve in to keep healthy,” he said. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
