Angry customers of a new generation bank expressed their rage by blocking all main security doors into the banking hall for not being attended to by the staff of the bank yesterday. The branch, located at Ahmadu Bello Way II, Jos, was crowd packed with customers. They claimed that they were being ignored for selected individuals who bribed their way through the back gate into the banking hall after waiting for hours to be allowed entrance into the banking hall. Some of the customers who breeched the physical distancing order revealed that they had been at the bank since 5:00 a.m. for collection of queue numbers from the security guard, hoping that the queue numbers would be followed and used to call in customers into the banking hall. While speaking to The Guardian, a customer revealed that he has been seeing some customers giving tips with bank details to a worker in an orange shirt for transactions. As at the time of writing this report yesterday afternoon, the entrance of the bank was still barricaded by customers while all attempts to speak with the branch manager proved abortive. This is coming barely 24 hours after the governor, Simon Bako Lalong, eased the COVID-19 lockdown in the state for Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday to enable people re-stock.
