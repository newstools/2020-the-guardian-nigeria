 Petrol Pump PHOTO: Reuters Petrol Pump PHOTO: Reuters  Mr Sadeq Ibraheem, DPR’s Operations Controller in Yola, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that the filling station was allegedly caught selling petrol at N125 per litre instead of the new price of N121.50 per litre. Ibraheem said that in spite of the warning and grace given to the marketers in the state to adjust their pump price, some failed to do so. “PPRA announced the reduction in the price of petrol from N125 to between N121:50 and N123: 00 per litre, depending on the landing cost. “A marketer is allowed to choose between the two approved prices. “But at this Conoil filling station in Yola town, the marketer has not complied with the Federal Government directive for the reduction in pump price of petrol,” he said. The operations controller said the marketer might be suspended from lifting products from NNPC depots or his operating licence might also be suspended or even revoked.
