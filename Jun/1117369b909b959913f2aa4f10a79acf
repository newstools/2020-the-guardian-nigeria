One of the babies was 20 days old and the other was two months, Rahimi said. Police had been alerted about “ads on Instagram for selling babies”, he added. They discovered 10 to 15 accounts involved in the scheme on the photo-sharing social media platform, and their administrators were arrested. Each baby had been bought for between 50 and 100 million rials ($255 to $510) before being offered for resale for 400-500 million, Rahimi said. The three people arrested had no prior records, he said, and the infants had since been handed over to social services. One of the three arrested was only identified by the initials M.A. According to ISNA, the suspect had allegedly said he acted as a middleman because he was unemployed and needed the money.
