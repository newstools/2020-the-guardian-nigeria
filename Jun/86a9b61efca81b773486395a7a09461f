• Brigands slay two in Katsina Through land and air offensives, Nigerian soldiers have killed 392 bandits since the commencement of ‘Operation Katsina’ in the North West and North Central. The Coordinator, Defence Media Operations (DMO), Defence Headquarters, Maj-Gen. John Enenche, at a briefing yesterday in Abuja, disclosed that the operation degraded the activities of the bandits and other criminal elements in the two regions. Enenche explained that some of the bandits, who escaped as a result of the operation, resorted to reprisal attacks on soft targets. “However, Operation Accord was preemptively planned by the high command of the Armed Forces of Nigeria (AFN) to handle this situation. In this regard, the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) ordered the commencement of Operation Accord from June 1, 2020. “Operation Accord is a joint operation involving the AFN and other security agencies. It is a concomitant operation by all the theatres of operations in the North West and North Central regions of the country targeted at tackling banditry and other criminal activities. “In this regard, all identified hideouts and hibernations of the enemies will be decisively cleared through land and air combat actions. This can easily be achieved through the provision of credible information that can translate to actionable intelligence,” he said. The Coordinator urged the general public to avail the various operational outfits in their locations with desirable information to enable security agencies to achieve the set objective. Similarly, bandits have shot and killed two persons in an attack on Dagwarwa village in Kurfi Council of Katsina State. Sources said the incident occurred yesterday about 1 a.m. when the bandits stormed the home of one Mallam Muazu. The Guardian learnt that the bandits shot and killed Muazu’s two sons.
