Former International, Felix Owolabi, is excited that the foreign-based Super Eagles players are now featuring regularly in league matches with the resumption of football across Europe after the suspension forced by the COVID-19 pandemic. Several Nigerian internationals played for their clubs at the weekend with some posting satisfactory performances. Speaking to The Guardian yesterday, Owolabi said watching the Nigerian players on cable television was a good omen, and would help the nation by the time international football resumes. “It means the players now know their worth and you know one can never slack when playing for clubs in Europe.  This is because over there, football is business and in that business, it is about one’s life. “So, you have to stake your talent and show that you are relevant. If not, you will be kept on the bench,” he said. Owolabi recalled, “Jose Mourinho once stated that given the same platform, respect, and atmosphere, African players are better compared to their European counterparts. Our boys are now trying to send a message to the world that they are in Europe for business. “Beside that, it is also good for the Nigerian football because by the time the fixtures for the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) and World Cup qualifying matches are released when international football resumes, the players would be ready for the challenges. “Coach Rohr has been given mandate to qualify and win the next AFCON. I think with the performances of the boys in Europe at the return of the leagues, it will be an easy task for Rohr,” he stated.
