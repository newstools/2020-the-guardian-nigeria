Organisers of the Higher Institutions Football League (HIFL) have disclosed that 29 schools would participate in this year’s competition, which will kick off after the COVID-19 crisis. According to the Chief Operating Officer of the league, Olamide Adeyemo, the schools were chosen from a list of 54 universities that indicated interest in the event. According to Adeyemo, “after a thorough and rigorous exercise carried out by the accreditation team, a final list of 29 universities across federal, state and private institutions from an initial 54 schools have been confirmed to participate in the 2020 season. “We remain grateful to all interested universities and their handlers for their laudable co-operation. The full list will be shared across our official digital channels immediately. Please be on the lookout for the groupings and other proceedings, pending the lifting of the bans.” He enjoined the schools and participating officials of the league to comply with the safety measures advised by the Federal Government, adding, “As a league, we are fully in support of the lockdown orders by the government (federal and state) in certain areas. This is critical and necessary as we look to flatten the epidemic curve in our fight against the virus. In addition, any return to action will only be with the full backing of the government and expert medical recommendations.” The league had earlier announced the suspension of the start of the season by one month and that fixtures will not return until the ban on academic/footballing activities elapses, he said, adding, “However, the kickoff date will remain under constant review and will be announced as soon as it is conclusive. We will continue to monitor developments and work with relevant stakeholders through this very challenging time.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
