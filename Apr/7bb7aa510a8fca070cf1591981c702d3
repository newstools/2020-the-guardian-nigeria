The Safari Hunters Association of Nigeria (SAHAN) has mourned the death of one of its members, Alhaji Dan Asabe, who was killed during a Joint Task Force (JTF) hunters/vigilante operation against Boko Haram terrorists and bandits at Rafi Area Local Government in Niger State.
 
The association said Asabe, who was tragically killed alongside five other members of his team, was until his death, the grand commander and head of the Kamuku local hunters/vigilante group of Mariga, Niger State. The group said Asabe’s passing has thrown open many issues as it concerns the welfare, protection and proper combat-kitting of the JTF and other supporting associations in the fight against insurgency and banditry in the country. 
 
A statement signed by its president, Capt. Bayo Araba, noted that the continued exposure to serious danger of the support bodies without seeming care of the Nigerian forces lends credence to the justification to stop their participation in these operations.
