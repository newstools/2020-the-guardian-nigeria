Transactions in the equities sector of the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) reopened on a downturn yesterday, as the All Share Index (ASI) plunged further by 2.02 per cent, following persistent sell-offs from investors. Precisely, the ASI dropped by 425.24 points or 2.02 per cent to 20,669.38 points. Accordingly, investors lost N222 billion in value as market capitalisation declined to N10.772 trillion. The downturn was impacted by losses recorded in medium and large capitalised stocks, amongst which are; Seplat Petroleum Development Company (Seplat), Dangote Cement, BUA Cement, BOC Gases Nigeria and Nigerian Aviation Handling Company (NAHCO). Analysts at United Capital Plc expected sentiment for stocks to remain broadly tepid, with renewed interests anticipated on select blue-chip stocks, as discerning investors continued to take advantage of the current market valuation. The chief research officer of Investdata Consulting Limited, Ambrose Omordion said: “We expect the mixed performance to continue depending on developments around the COVID-19 pandemic in the new week, as the government implements measures to contain the spread while addressing the adverse effects on the economy.” However market breadth closed positive, with 21 gainers versus 13 losers.
