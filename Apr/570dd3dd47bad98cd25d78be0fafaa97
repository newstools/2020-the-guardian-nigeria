The Chief Operating Officer, InvestData Consulting Limited, Ambrose Omordion said: “We expect profit taking to continue since the index had formed another double top on mixed sentiment and negative news on oil price as smart money repositions their portfolios ahead of more corporate earnings and March inflation data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).
