A single mother of three, Kafayat Alake, has attempted suicide by jumping into the Osun River in Osogbo, Osun State capital yesterday over her inability to continue catering for her children. But for the timely intervention of some residents of Aregbesola area of Osogbo, the woman would have drowned. Alake jumped into the river few hours after the state government imposed a stay-at-home order on residents of the state as part of measures to curb the spread of the deadly coronavirus pandemic. Alake’s strange movement on the bridge was said to have been noticed by some passersby before she eventually jumped into the river. Some passersby had raised the alarm before youths in the area trooped out, dived into the river and rescued the woman. “We were somewhere around that place when the woman fell into the river. At first, we thought she slipped while walking on the bridge but we later discovered it was a suicide dive. While others were calling for help, I had to jump into the river before others joined me in rescuing her,” a resident said. Alake, while being questioned by reporters after her rescue, said she hails from Alapaaro, Isale Osun, Osogbo. According to her, she has three children and she could not continue to fend for them due to her financial predicament. She added that her husband stays in Lagos adding that she got separated from her husband thirteen years ago. The woman was later rushed to a nearby hospital by the O’Ambulance team of the state.
