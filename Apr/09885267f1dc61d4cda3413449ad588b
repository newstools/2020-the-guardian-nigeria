Talent Sports Max recently launched on the Intelsat 20 and BADR 7 Free-to-Air (FTA) Direct-to-Home (DTH) satellite platforms operated by Viewmedia. These satellites, combined, give a reach of over 50 million homes in 70-plus countries across the globe. “We are proud to work with SRO Motorsports Group and ViewMedia to bring the SRO E-Sport GT Series to sports fans across Africa Live,” said Talent Sports CEO, Tolu Badejo. “These partnerships ensure Talent Sports Max viewers in over 70 countries enjoy premium sports content for free, despite the impact of the Covid-19 crisis on sports events. Without a doubt, over the next three months, fans will enjoy First class e-racing, which promises to light up homes.” Also speaking the Founder and CEO SRO Motorsports Group, Stephane Ratel, said: “I am very happy that Talent Sport Nigeria will carry coverage of the SRO ESport GT Series, taking this exciting new virtual championship to fans across Africa. In times like these, we are pleased to provide an opportunity to enjoy a different kind of racing while remaining at home. With so many of our real-world drivers competing, it certainly promises to be a very competitive championship.” Adam Lowe, Head of New Business at ViewMedia added: “We are delighted to be able to work with SRO Motorsports Group and Talent Sports to deliver the E-Sport GT Series across Africa in the coming weeks. Talent Sports have been a fantastic addition to our FTA channel line-up in Africa across the BADR 7 and Intelsat 20 platforms, and their partnership with SRO Motorsports Group only goes to further that. It will be a significant moment for us all, as it will be one of the only – if not the only – live sports event broadcast in the continent in the coming weeks.” A total of 49 drivers have been confirmed for the SRO E-Sport GT Series’ Pro class, which gets underway on Sunday with a grid entirely made up of real-world drivers. The lineup includes 2009 Formula 1 world champion Jenson Button, who will be driving a McLaren 720S GT3, as well as drivers from the Lamborghini, McLaren, Mercedes-AMG and Bentley factory rosters. Ferrari has the largest Pro-class contingent with seven entries, although three of its drivers are to be announced. McLaren, Lamborghini, Porsche and Bentley will have six entries each while Aston Martin, Audi and Mercedes-AMG are to be represented by five competitors. GTWC overall champions from the last three years will be taking part, with Christian Engelhart in a Porsche 911 GT3 R, Raffaele Marciello in a Mercedes-AMG GT3 and Andrea Caldarelli in a Lamborghini Huracan GT3. The Lamborghini entry also includes ex-Formula 1 driver Vitantonio Liuzzi and reigning International GT Open champion Albert Costa. Announced earlier this month, the SRO E-Sport GT Series builds on the charity race held on virtual Monza in late March but now features separate grids for real-world, sim and wildcard fan drivers. Real-world and sim drivers will race on the same days but in different races, under the Pro and Silver class names, while fans can compete for a spot in the Am class races, which will begin in mid-May.
