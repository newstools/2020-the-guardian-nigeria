The Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF) has raised the alarm on Boko Haram/Islamic State’s West Africa Province (ISWAP) terrorists’ recruitment drive in the Lake Chad region to replace its lost fighters. The alarm was reportedly based on credible information on the terrorists’ plot to launch aggressive indoctrination and recruitment drives. MNJTF’s spokesman, Col. Timothy Antigha, stated yesterday in Maiduguri that “the terrorists’ recruitment drive commences in May 2020,” adding that Boko Haram was targeting young male adults to continue terrorism in the Lake Chad region. The task force comprises armed forces of Chad, Nigeria, Cameroon and Niger who are fighting insurgency in member countries of Lake Chad Basin Commission (LCBC). “The backup plan is to kidnap unwilling targets into recruitment and indoctrination drives of Boko Haram,” he disclosed. Noting that in the last few weeks, offensive operations and internal squabbles for money and power depleted Boko Haram/ISWAP fighting capacity, he said the terrorist group planned to use the recruitment to replenish depleted fighters and manpower. Antigha, therefore, urged youths in North East states of Nigeria, Lake Province of Chad, Diffa region of Niger and extreme north region of Cameroon to be vigilant. He warned the youths to shun promises of opportunities for quick money, including misguided teachings about jihad, just as he appealed to clerics, community leaders and parents to sensitise their congregations, family members and children.“You are encouraged to report suspicious activities to law enforcement agencies,” he added.
