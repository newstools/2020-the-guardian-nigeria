A Lagos businesswoman, Mrs. Bola Chidi, has declared her 24-year-old daughter, Bianca Ada Chidi, missing. Chidi, who spoke amidst tears, said Bianca went for her National Youth Service Corp (NYSC) mobilization at Ile Ife, Osun State and did not come back home till now.
 
According to her, “she was returning from Ife on March 16, and she called me when she got to Ojodu-Berger, Lagos. She called me later when she entered a bus going to Iyana Ipaja. After a while, she called me again that she would soon alight at the last bus stop in Iyana Ipaja, which is quite close to Abule-Egba where we live.
 
“After waiting for 45 minutes and I didn’t hear from her, I decided to call her but her phone was switched off and ever since then, her phone hasn’t been on. It has been six weeks now that we haven’t heard anything from her and I have gone to different police stations to make reports and the IGP/IRT department of police to help us track her phone lines and investigate the matter but I have not seen any favorable results.
