Weeks after Lagos State government said it would advise private hospitals not to treat Coronavirus patients, it has declared that it accredited First Cardiology Consultants, Lagos, where Mallam Abba Kyari died on Friday. The State government, through the Commissioner for Health, Professor Akin Abayomi, in a statement, yesterday, said: “Following enquiries on the passing away of the Chief of Staff to the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Mallam Abba Kyari on Friday 17 April 2020, the Lagos State Government states that: “Mallam Abba Kyari died from complications of Coronavirus infection at First Cardiology Consultants in Lagos. This hospital is a Lagos State designated high care, biosecurity-compliant, COVID-19 facility, accredited by the Health Facility Management and Accreditation Agency (HEFAMAA) of the Lagos State Ministry of Health. “As a basis for accreditation, First Cardiology Consultants established a separate specialist wing with staff dedicated to the treatment of complicated cases of COVID-19, under the supervision of the Lagos State COVID-19 emergency response team.” Ironically, the Commissioner had, during a COVID-19 press briefing, said private hospitals across the state were not yet allowed to treat Covid-19 patients. He made the statement days after Kyari was already being attended to in the private facility. “We are not encouraging the private sector to manage COVID-19 at this point in time for a number of reasons. It is still an issue of the state and national security that cases of COVID-19 are managed in recognised facilities. “However, patients with pneumonia can be treated in a private hospitals, but as soon as we know they are positive, we will endeavour to move them as fast as possible to an isolation facility. That is not always so easy, especially if the case is developing complications and they are requiring ventilation,” Abayomi stated.
