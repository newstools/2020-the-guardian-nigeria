PHOTO: FEMI ADEBESIN-KUTI Nigeria’s first Olympic Games individual gold medallist, Chioma Ajunwa, has advised the country’s athletes to continue with their training programmes despite the recent postponement of the Tokyo 2020 Games. Ajunwa became the country’s first individual gold medallist when she won the women long jump at the Atlanta 1996 Games. The former member of the senior women national football team said the COVID-19 lockdown should not stop the athletes from maintaining their training routine indoors, adding that such exercises would condition their bodies for success when the games eventually hold. She reminded the athletes that winning Olympics medals requires many sacrifices and hard work. “The athletes should realize that when they relax their training because of the lockdown, it would be difficult for them to get back to full fitness before the Olympics. “We pray the COVID-19 is eradicated so that the athletes will have more opportunity to train with the right facilities for their sports. Nigerian athletes are hard working and determined to succeed in every championship, and winning medals will not be difficult at the Olympics if they used the right approach to prepare before the Games,” she said.
