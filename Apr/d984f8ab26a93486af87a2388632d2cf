 WASHINGTON, DC – APRIL 27: U.S. President Donald Trump answers questions during the daily briefing of the coronavirus task force in the Rose Garden of the White House on April 27, 2020 in Washington, DC. Today’s task force briefing is the first since Friday.

I just wish him well.” “I hope he’s fine,” Trump continued, speaking at a White House press conference. “I do know how he’s doing, relatively speaking.” Trump said the media would “probably be hearing in the not-too-distant future” about Kim. Conjecture has grown since Kim’s conspicuous no-show at April 15 celebrations for the birthday of his grandfather Kim Il Sung, the North’s founder the most important day in the country’s political calendar. Kim has not made a public appearance since presiding over a Workers’ Party politburo meeting on April 11, and the following day state media reported on him inspecting fighter jets at an air defense unit. Amid media reports that he was ill and speculation that he might even have died, a top security adviser to South Korean President Moon Jae-in said Sunday that Kim was in fact “alive and well.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
