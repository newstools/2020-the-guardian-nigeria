Nigerian government on Monday extended the suspension of airline operations for another two weeks. “As a result of the extension on lockdown by Mr President, it is no longer possible for us to open our airspace and airports for normal operations by the 23rd April 2020,” aviation minister Hadi Sirika said. “They will remain closed for a further 2 weeks.” The minister also stated that the order is subject to review as appropriate. All International Airports in the country were shut down in March following the outbreak of coronavirus in the country. The closure of the country’s land and International borders is part of the measures to curb COVID-19 in the country as over 2.4million cases of coronavirus have been reported globally. The Federal Government also restricted all local flights. Only essential flights, which include cargo services, emergency landing, and evacuation, among others, were allowed though subject to the approval of the Minister of Aviation. Also, Lagos State, Ogun State, and the capital city Abuja have been shut down for more than two weeks. Other Nigerian states have also announced some similar measures to curb the spread of the virus. As of 11:50 pm on Sunday, April 19, Nigeria has recorded 627 cases of COVID 19 with 170 discharged and 21 deaths.
