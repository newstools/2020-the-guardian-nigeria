Putin had a phone call with Trump and Saudi Arabia’s King Salman late on Thursday, the Kremlin said, with the conversation focussed on global oil prices. It was the second call since March 30 between the US and Russian leaders, with Trump saying after the Thursday conversation that they “get along very well”, even though bilateral relations have been at their lowest point since the Cold War. Moscow last week has sent a military plane with medical aid and equipment to New York, the epicentre of the US coronavirus epidemic.
