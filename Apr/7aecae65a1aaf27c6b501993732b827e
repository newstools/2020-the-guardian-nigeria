The tradition in the North allows men to be opened to marriage with many women as long as the man can provide for the women and their offsprings. However, the tradition is not applicable to females. It does not permit women to marry more than one husband. It is termed a taboo for the females to be the wife of more than one male. It is also customary for all the wives to live together in the same compound with each other and their husband.

These areas include Algeria, Mali, Kenya, Tanzania, Pakistan, Lebanon, Kuwait Iran and many more.
