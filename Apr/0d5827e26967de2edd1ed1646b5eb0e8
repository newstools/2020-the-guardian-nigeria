Southern Kaduna Indigenes, under the umbrella of Southern Kaduna Peoples Union (SOKAPU) have raised alarm over alleged coordinated attacks and killings by armedi herdsmen in their communities, despite the lockdown against the spread of Coronavirus in the state. In a statement, SOKAPU said in the past 48 hours, communities in three local councils in the southern part of Kaduna State have, again, come under coordinated attacks by armed herdsmen. The statement issued by SOKAPU National Public Relations Officer, Luka Biniyat, said: “This, and many other savageries on our communities in recent times, affirm the fear that for our vulnerable communities, the danger posed to our existence and wellbeing by the Coronavirus pandemic is less grim than the perennial murderous acts of armed herdsmen. “They not only kill in the most gruesome manner, they plunder, loot, carry out mass scale arson and then kidnap their victims, despite the lockdown. Last Wednesday, April 23, 2020, around 10pm, gunshots were heard from different directions in Atang, near Gidan Waya in Godogodo Chiefdom of Jemaa Local Government. After the pandemonium, it was discovered that the invaders had kidnapped Mr. Emmanuel Iliya Atang, son of the Chief of Godogodo Chiefdom… As at yesterday, his abductors called to ask for N30m ransom…” Listing the numerous persons that had been killed and kidnapped in different areas, the group decried the cruelty and wantonness of the herdsmen. SOKAPU however, commended “the effort put up by our security defending Akwunakwo. We acknowledge the supreme sacrifice paid by the fallen soldier and pray for the repose of his soul.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
