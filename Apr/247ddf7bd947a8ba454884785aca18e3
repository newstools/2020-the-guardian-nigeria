According to her manager, John Miller, she died at her home in Philadelphia on Wednesday; at this time, her cause of death is unknown. “Chynna was deeply loved and will be sorely missed,” the young rapper’s family said in a statement provided to PEOPLE. The upcoming star’s death comes just four months after she released the EP If I Die First. Chynna began her career as a model when she was 14 after signing with Ford Models. During her rise to fame, she was mentored by A$AP Yams — who died in 2015 — and her association with A$AP Mob helped her first gain popularity in the hip hop scene. Her music career took off in 2013 after she released her hit track “Selfie” and “Glen Coco” in 2014. She then released the EPs I’m Not Here, This Isn’t Happening in 2015 and Music 2 Die 2 in 2016. On her 2016 album, she addressed her struggle with opioid addiction, according to Pitchfork. During a 2018 interview with Pitchfork, Chynna explained that her music served as an escape for her and offered a way for fans to know they are not alone. Since news of her death, a number of celebrities and fellow artists have paid tribute on Twitter.
