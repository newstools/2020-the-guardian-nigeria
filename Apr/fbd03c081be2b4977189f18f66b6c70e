Dr Babajide Puddicombe, President, Malaria Society of Nigeria (MSN), has called on the Federal Government to construct underground drainage system across the country to minimise deaths due to malaria. Puddicombe gave the advice in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), in Ota, Ogun, on Sunday. He was speaking against the backdrop of the World Malaria Day, marked on April 25. “`The gradual construction of underground drainage systems all over the country will go a long way in eliminating the major breeding sites for the female anopheles mosquito that transmits the malaria parasites, ‘’ he said. According to him, massive construction of underground drainage will significantly reduce the number of deaths from malaria in the country. Puddicombe also urged the Federal Government to educate the people on the importance of environmental management and sleeping under insecticide treated nets that would also significantly curb deaths resulting from malaria. He called for collective efforts in the fight against malaria adding that achieving zero malaria infection in the country was a task for everyone.
