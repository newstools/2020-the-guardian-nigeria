Onyema Operatives from the office of the Inspector General of police have arrested a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Enugu State, James Okugo Nwanjoku, over alleged social media comment on the Coronavirus status of the Foreign Affairs Minister, Geoffrey Onyema. Nwanjoku, who is APC Youth Leader in Enugu West Senatorial Zone, was whisked away from his father’s palace in Oduma, Friday evening, and detained at the Police Area Command in Enugu, to be moved to Abuja later today (Sunday). The Minister had earlier accused the chieftain of publishing false information against him and his personnel assistant, Mr. Flavour Eze in the social media to the effect that they had contracted the deadly virus. In a petition from his counsel, Enechi Onyia (SAN), the Minister had demanded a retraction of the said comments from Nwanjoku or be prepared to face litigation. Last Friday evening, a team of policemen had stormed Oduma community in Aninri Council of the state and arrested Nwanjoku, whose father is the community’s traditional ruler.
