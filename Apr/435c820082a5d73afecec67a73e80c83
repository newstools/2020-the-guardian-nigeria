After many weeks of inaction, golfers in Port Harcourt now have the opportunity to practice their craft at the Air Assault Club even as the ban on courses is still on. Reports say the news has elicited so much excitement among golfers that they have started getting their gears ready to roll. Speaking on the development, a category one player, Love Ndareke, said opening the course for training was a welcome development. “I am really happy that the management of Air Assault Club deemed it necessary to open the course for us to start training. It will help to improve the performance of the players ahead of upcoming tournaments. “We have been maintaining social distance anyway… we are keeping all the safety rules against COVID-19 so that we can save lives.” While Air Assault has been opened, the neighbouring Port Harcourt Golf Club, which hosts most of the championships in Rivers State, is still closed. According to Port Harcourt Club Manager, Mr. Pennington, “The Club remains shut down although some essential services are also going on. “I want to believe in no distant time life will bounce back in the club. “Let me state clearly here that the course was not closed to punish our esteemed golfers. Rather, it was simply to help save lives because of the Coronavirus pandemic, which we hope to overcome soon by God’s grace,” he said.
