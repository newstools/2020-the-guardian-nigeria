Frightened by the October 1, 2010 bomb blast at the Eagle Square, President Jonathan, GCFR, sacked Colonel Are on October 4, 2010 and appointed General Owoye Andrew Azazi (1952-2012) as National Security Adviser on October 4, 2010. General Azazi was also of course 12 of the Nigerian Defence Academy Regular Course. General Azazi was former Chief of Defence Staff and Chief of Army Staff. On April 27, 2012 at Asaba in Delta state, General Azazi blamed the Boko Haram insurgency on the internal wrangling within the ruling PDP. It was a joke carried too far. Two months later General Azazi was sacked. On June 22, 2012, the same President Jonathan appointed Colonel Sabo Dasuki (64) (rtd.) as National Security Adviser. Colonel Sambo Dasuki was also of Course 12 of the Nigerian Defence Academy Regular Course. The former Chief of Naval Staff, Admiral (rtd.) Ganiyu Tunde Adegboyega Adekeye (67) from Offa in Kwara state was also a student of Course 12. Colonel Dasuki served as National Security Adviser between June 22, 2012 to July 2015. Colonel Dasuki (rtd.) is the first son of late Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Ibrahim Dasuki (1923-2006), who reigned between 1988 and 1996. When Colonel Sabo Dasuki was born on December 5, 1954, his dad, who was then the Chief Private Secretary to the late Premier of Northern Nigeria, Alhaji Ahmadu Bello, was not in the country. He was in Saudi Arabia for the Hajj. He therefore delegated his then deputy, Alhaji Gidado Idris to go to the hospital in Kaduna and be present at the delivery of the new baby. Alhaji Gidado Idris later became Secretary to the Government of the Federation. Colonel Dasuki has deep knowledge of many issues and has many friends across the country irrespective of tribe and religion. Widely travelled, Colonel Dasuki is of the royal family in Sokoto. Because of his detention, he was not present at the burial of his late father, Alhaji Ibrahim Dasuki, GCON and at the funeral also of Alhaji Gidado Idris, GCON. Colonel Dasuki was recently released on bail. The present National Security Adviser, Major General (rtd.) Mohammed Babagana Monguno was appointed by President Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR, on July 13 2015. General Monguno was Chief of Nigeria’s Defence Intelligence Agency from July 2009 to September 2011. General Monguno has spent most of his life in Lagos right from his days at Kings College. His childhood friend is Prince Dapo Oyewunmi, a lawyer and graduate of Obafemi Awolowo University in Ile-Ife, who is the son of Soun of Ogbomosho, Oba Oladunni Oyewunmi Ajagungbade III. General Monguno is a lucky man. He is a member of Course 21 who enlisted into the Nigeria Defence Academy, Kaduna on January 3, 1977. Many members of Course 21 died on September 26, 1992, when their Hercules C-130 plane of the Nigerian Air force plunged into the Ejigbo Canal in Lagos. At 1730hours on that day a Nigerian Air Force Military Transport Plane, a Lockheed C-130H-LM HERCULES (L-82), production number 4624, registration number NAF 911, piloted by Wing Commanders J.P. Alabesunu and A.S. Mamadi crashed enroute to Kaduna. Some reports claim there were 163 on board. Others have said there were actually174 passengers on the ill-fated flight, including some unidentified civilians, personnel of the Nigerian Air Force Military School, Jos and other military personnel who hitched a ride. Those who died in the ill-fated crash were members of Courses 19, 20 and 21 of the NDA. LIST A: ARMY:-Lt Colonels——1. S.A. Onipede N/2888 2. A.J. Ibiyeye N/33300 3. J.A. Agber N/2712 4.

They were in Lagos on Naval tour as part of the senior division Course. General Monguno is the nephew of Shettima Ali Monguno, a Federal Minister during the first Republic, whom I met when he was a member of the Constituent Assembly between 1977 and 1979. For General Monguno to be alive today is by the grace of God. General Monguno also served as Commander, Guards Brigade, Deputy Commandant, National Defence College, and Chief of Defence Intelligence. Prior to his retirement from the Nigerian army he was considered for Chief of Army Staff position. General Monguno voluntarily retired from the Nigerian Army in September 2013. It was around that time that former President Goodluck Jonathan appointed Major General Kenneth Minimah (60) (flying General) of Course 25 as the Chief of Army Staff. The present Chief of Army Staff, Lt-General Tukur Yusuf Buratai is of Course 29 while the former Chief of Army Staff, General Onyeabo Ihejerika was of Course 25, General Monuguno’s colleagues of Course 21 included the former Chief of Defence Staff, Air Chief Marshal Alex Sabundu Badeh (November 7, 1957 – December 18, 2018). The question is what is so special about the job of National Security Adviser that both the Police and the military have monopolised the appointment. What is wrong in a civilian becoming the National Security Adviser? In our statue there is nothing in it that indicates that the National Security Adviser is the boss of the Service chiefs or that he must be a retired military officer or must have a military background. The National Security Adviser in Canada is a woman—Greta Bossenmaier. Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau raided Canada’s secretive cybersy on May 7, 2017 to pick her. Even in France, a woman is also the NSA, Claire Landais was appointed February 28, 2017. In France they call the office, Secretariat General for National Defence and Security, founded in 1906. Sometimes ago I read that in Britain “The NSA is secretary to the National Security Council which is chaired by the Prime Minister and head of National Security and Intelligence (National Security Secretariat) which is part of the Cabinet Office. The NSA will also advise Secretaries of State and other government ministers on issues of national security when necessary. The NSA is the Senior Responsible Officer for the Conflict, Stability and Security Fund, with a budget of over 1billion pounds. The first National Security Adviser (NSA) of the United Kingdom was Sir Peter Ricketts, who was previously Permanent Secretary of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and Chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee. He handed over to Sir Kim Darroch in January 2012. On 7 July 2015, it was announced that Sir Mark Lyall Grant would replace Darroch as National Security Adviser in early September 2015. Mark Sedwill assumed the role in April 2017”. The same Sir Darroch is the one involved recently with President Donald trump in diplomatic row as Britain’s ambassador to the United States. On India, the National Security Advisor (NSA) is tasked with regularly advising the Prime Minister on all matters relating to internal and external threats to the country, and oversees strategic issues. The NSA of India also serves as the Prime Minister’s Special Interlocutor on border issues with China, and frequently accompanies the Prime Minister on Foreign State visits. The following have served as National Security Advisors in India. They are Brajesh Mishra (November 1998-May 2004), J.N. Dixit (May 2004-January 2005), M.K. Narayanan (January 2005- January 2010), Shivshankar Menon (January 2010-May 2014) and Ajit Doval (May 2014, incumbent). They are all civil servants or diplomats. Among the National Security Advisers in USA only seven were Generals. Since 1953 the National Security Advisers are Robert Cutler (March 23, 1953-April 2, 1955), Dillon Anderson (April 2, 1955-September 1, 1956), William Harding Jackson    (September 1, 1956-January 7, 1957), Robert Cutler (January 7, 1957-June 24, 1958), Gordon Gray (June 24, 1958-January 13, 1961), McGeorge Bundy(January 20, 1961-February 28, 1966),Walt Rostow (April 1, 1966-January20,1969), Henry Kissinger(January 20, 1969-November 3, 1975), Brent Scowcroft (November 3, 1975-January 20, 1977), Zbigniew Brzezinski(January 20, 1977-January 20, 1981), Richard V. Allen (January 21, 1981-January 4, 1982),    William P. Clark, Jr. (January 4, 1982-October 17, 1983) ,Robert McFarlane (October 17, 1983-December 4, 1985), Admiral John Poindexter (December 4, 1985-November 25, 1986),Frank Carlucci (December 2, 1986-November 23, 1987, Colin Powell (November 23, 1987-January 20, 1989), Brent Scowcroft (January 20, 1989-January 20, 1993), Anthony Lake (January 20, 1993-March 14, 1997), Sandy Berger (March 14, 1997-January 20, 2001), Condoleezza Rice (January 22, 2001-January 25, 2005), Stephen Hadley(January 26, 2005-January 20, 2009), James Jones (January 20, 2009-October 8, 2010) ,Tom Donilon (October 8, 2010-July 1, 2013), Susan Rice (July 1, 2013-January 20, 2017)H. R. McMaster (February 20, 2017-April 9, 2018), John R. Bolton  (April 9, 2018- September 18, 2019) and Robert O’Brien (September 18, 2018 till date) In Nigeria the National Security Adviser supervises the activities of the Security Agencies, like DSS, NIA, DIA, NPF, NA, NAF, NN and to a large extent even the quasi Agencies, like Civil Defense, NDLEA, The Fire Service Nigeria Customs Service and Nigerian Immigration Service and EFCC but the last six are not too attached to the ONSA, like the first Seven Agencies. The first group is grouped in what is called The Intelligence community committee (ICC), and this group meets, weekly at ONSA, to review all the security situation of the Country and challenges, and try to proffer solutions. It is normally chaired by the NSA, or the most senior person, among them, in his absence. It is however, instructive, to know that, these Agencies, are all independent, they have their heads, and have their budgets, separate from ONSA, and are all Service Chiefs, who have access to the President, directly, without going through the NSA, if the need arises, but report all their activities, almost on daily basis to the NSA. The second group, is kind of second class, in terms of access, to either, the President or NSA, as most of them are controlled directly by Ministers. They however attend, the fortnightly meetings at ONSA, called JOINT INTELLIGENCE BOARD (JIB). The JIB, is an enlarged security committee, and many Agencies, parastatal and even some Perm Secs and Ministers attend, from time to time, depending on the matters to be discussed. Normally ONSA, sends invitations sometimes. The Office of the Perm Sec. Special Services act as secretary, of these meetings. Beside these major activities ONSA, also has a lot of other departments directly working under it, like the Office of Counter Terrorism, Office of Rehabilitation and Reorientation. International Department, Issuance of end user licenses, for the importation of all arms, explosives, military and paramilitary Equipment and all security assets, including bullet proof vehicles. This a summary of the functions of ONSA. The larger JIB also consist of NEMA, ICPC, NPA, FAAN, NIMASA and the rest. The first group attend both meetings and other Ad Hoc meetings. The functions of the National Security Adviser varies from administration to administration; and depends, not only on the qualities of the person appointed to the position, but also on the style and management philosophy of the incumbent President. There is no doubt that a career in the military or indeed any of the intelligence agencies is good consideration for appointment as NSA. However, unlike in Nigeria where all appointees to the position since 1990 have not just come from the military but Army background, those appointed to the post of National Security Adviser across the globe have come from diverse backgrounds, especially in the United States, United Kingdom and India. This is a pointer to the fact that what the position requires are not necessarily military or combatant skills. Managerial and some peculiar skills, especially the ability to harness and exercise due diligence and respect in treating briefs from every member of the intelligence community and to respond to their needs with equal attention appear to be the non-disputable requirements of the post. In this regard, for an appointee into the position of NSA, a career background in the military or any of the bodies in the intelligence community could be a burden in terms of getting the other members of the Community to see fairness and objectivity in the way their agencies are treated as well as the level of importance attached to their intelligence briefs and other submissions.
