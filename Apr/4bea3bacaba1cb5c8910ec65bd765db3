The five people, Abdulrazaq said, were family members of the confirmed cases who “were taken to a different part of the isolation centre out of abundance of caution.” The governor said 11 persons are left in the facility. “Two of these 11 are COVID-19 patients while the remaining nine are people who haven’t tested positive but have had varying contacts with the confirmed cases,” Abdulrazaq said. “They are all doing pretty good, and we wish the remaining two patients quick recovery.” Abdulrazaq noted that the recoveries are a testament that COVID-19 is not a death sentence. He, however, warned members of the public against stigmatising the coronavirus survivors. “We will punish anyone who stigmatises any of our patients or members of their families,” Ad He commended all health workers in the state and residents for their support to the government in containing coronavirus in Kwara State.
