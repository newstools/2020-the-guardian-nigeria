The situation will “soon be mastered”, Fakhfakh declared in a televised interview late Sunday, saying this would allow for a step-by-step re-opening of the economy and society. Tunisia has been under a 6pm to 6am curfew since March 17 and authorities imposed stricter lockdown orders on March 22. “Up to now we have been successful,” Fakhfakh said. “But we are not yet through” the pandemic, he warned, declaring that “we want to flatten the curve” of the number of infections. Since the country confirmed its first case of the respiratory disease in early March, Tunisia has declared 38 deaths from the virus among 879 confirmed infections. With the advent of Ramadan, the curfew will begin two hours later, at 8pm. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
