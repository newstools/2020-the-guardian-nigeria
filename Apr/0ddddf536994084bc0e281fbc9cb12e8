The Nigeria Government on Wednesday commenced the disbursement of N20,000 Conditional Cash Transfer to poor homes in the country. Speaking at the commencement of the cash transfer at the Kwali Area Council of Abuja, Nigeria’s humanitarian affairs, disaster management and social development minister Sadiya Umar Farouq said distribution of the funds were in compliance to the directive of President Muhammadu Buhari. “We have directed immediate cash transfer to the poorest and most vulnerable households in the country,” Farouq said. “Because of this COVID-19, the vulnerable groups have to expand, because we are aware that there are people who live on daily wage, so we are also going to look at those groups of people to see how we can get this food relief intervention to them in this period.” Farouq in a statement on Tuesday said the government will be distributing food items to vulnerable households in the country during the coronavirus stay-at-home period. She said the food items will be distributed to vulnerable households in Lagos, FCT, and Ogun State where Buhari ordered their lockdown for 14 days on Sunday. Farouq noted that the government’s relief programmes will help Nigerians reduce the hardship caused by the outbreak of coronavirus which necessitated a stay-at-home order by the government.
