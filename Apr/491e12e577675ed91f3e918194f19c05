The National Union of Adamawa State Students (NUADSS) has given a multinational company (name withheld) seven days to redress the killing of one of its members. According to NUADSS, Kamaluddeen Hussain, a final year student of the Modibbo Adama University of Technology (MAUTECH), Yola, was hit and killed by a truck driver who fled the scene The students alleged that the company has done nothing since the incident. President of NUADSS, Gaddafi Hussaini, said the deceased student was on his way out of the mosque within the university campus after an evening prayer when the reckless truck driver ran over him. He said the truck driver ran off after the incident while the said company has allegedly done nothing since then to empathise with the bereaved family. The NUADSS President asked the company to “take responsibility for the action of its reckless driver and compensate the family of the deceased within the next seven days or face litigation. “We will have no choice but to resort to the court to get justice for our colleague’” Gaddafi said the deceased who died on March 3 and buried the following day was a management technology student of MAUTECH. According to him, witnesses confirmed that the man was overspeeding when he lost control and headed for the far roadside where Kamaluddeen and a few others were standing and ran over them which led to the deceased died on the spot. He said his union expected the company to have sent a representative on a condolence visit to the family of the deceased.
