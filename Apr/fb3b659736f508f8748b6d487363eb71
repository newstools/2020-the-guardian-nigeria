Putin donned a bright yellow hazmat suit for the visit last Tuesday to the hospital. He was also seen talking to Protsenko without any protective gear but the Kremlin said there is no reason for concern about the president’s health. “All of those who were with the president at Kommunarka are being tested daily for the coronavirus,” Peskov added, after saying on Tuesday that “everything is fine” with Putin. Asked if Putin continued to shake hands with those he is meeting, Peskov said: “Of course everyone is now social distancing.” Almost 70 percent of Russia’s 147 million population has been ordered into strict confinement over the pandemic, following a first announcement by the mayor of Moscow on Sunday. Russia has so far registered 2,777 cases of the coronavirus and 24 deaths, mostly in Moscow. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
