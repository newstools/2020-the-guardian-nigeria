Chelsea has triggered the option to extend France striker Olivier Giroud’s contract by a year until June 2021, a source said Saturday. Giroud, 33, signed for Chelsea in winter 2018 from cross-city rivals Arsenal. The 33-year-old has scored 39 goals in 97 appearances for France, making him his country’s third-highest goalscorer behind Michel Platini (41) and Thierry Henry (51), and the striker will be vying for a spot at next year’s European Championship.
