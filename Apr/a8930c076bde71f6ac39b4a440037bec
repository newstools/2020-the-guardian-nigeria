I am sure if given a choice, our leaders would not choose this option of lockdown, so let’s all please take it that our lives are more important than anything else, including economic wellbeing. “l also want  to also use this opportunity to reach out to the weightlifting federation and express our sincere condolences on the death of the president, who happens to be a very good friend of mine as well.
