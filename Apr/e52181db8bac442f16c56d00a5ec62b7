The implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA), suffered yet another blow, with the announcement of its suspension, as African countries struggle to deal with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
 
With borders closed and supply chain disrupted globally, the trade deal expected to kick off in July was suspended to allow countries to deal with the pandemic. The Secretary-General of AfCFTA, Wamkele Mene, said on Tuesday that implementation of the free trade agreement will not be able to commence on July 1, due to the disruptions occasioned by the coronavirus pandemic.  “Together with our fellow African countries, we must implement the AfCFTA agreement with purpose and determination. We must undertake the detailed work, extensive consultation and complex negotiations required to give life to this agreement.
 
“In this regard, South Africa will work with President Issoufou of Niger, who is the AU Champion on Continental Economic Integration. This work is directed towards the social and economic development of the Continent, and the realisation of a prosperous Africa based on inclusive growth and sustainable development,” Ramaphosa added.
