Motivation for continued oil production may drop further as oil prices fail to rebound, despite the OPEC+ production cut deal, even as available oil storage capacity around the world runs thin due to drop in global oil demand amid lockdowns and travel restrictions in many countries.
   
Indeed, energy experts project that OPEC producers, like Angola, Nigeria, and Iraq, who don’t have adequate refining capacity at home and don’t have solid long-term oil supply contracts with oil-importing nations are set to lose the most.
   
If prices continue to fall below production cost, many oil producers may be forced to shut crude production, amidst difficulty in getting the cargoes sold.  Its Director-General, Dr. Muda Yusuf, said though oil prices will retain some gain, the effect would not be huge until the lockdown is lifted globally.
   
Considering that 100-percent compliance in every country has never been achieved in such deals, OPEC members would be likely producing more than two times their combined refinery capacity.
   
OPEC and its Russia-led allies promised to remove 9.7mbpd from the market starting in May. But oil storage capacity may be full as early as in the middle of May, according to many analysts. 
   
Despite the actions of OPEC+ and G20 to ease the glut, the oil industry may test the limits of its storage capacity in the coming weeks, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said this week.
 
“Never before has the oil industry come this close to testing its logistics capabilities to the limit,” the agency said in its closely-watched Oil Market Report for April.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
