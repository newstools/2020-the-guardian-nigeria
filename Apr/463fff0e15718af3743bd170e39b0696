Bello, a son of Kaduna State Governor, Nasir El-Rufai today armed himself with insults and threats in response to Nigerian social media users who criticized his comment on United States President Donald Trump. On Sunday morning [April 4], Bello in a tweet inferred that the President of the United States, Donald Trump is an “incompetent leader”. The governor’s son further said that this term was applicable to the leaders of “a few states in Nigeria” too. “There is nothing as radioactive as an incompetent leader during a time of crisis. The United States of America is a case in point. A few states in Nigeria too.” The subliminal jab at Trump did not go well with a number of social media users who reacted by bringing to bare comparisons between the administration of Donald Trump and Nigeria’s President Buhari as well as Bello’s father, Nasir El-Rufai. However, in his comeback response to the criticisms, Bello resorted to insults and threats including calling.
