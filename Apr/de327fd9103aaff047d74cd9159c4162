The prime minister’s office did not immediately respond to requests for information. But public broadcaster Radio-Canada said Margaret Trudeau, who is also the widow of late prime minister Pierre Trudeau, was treated in hospital for smoke inhalation and possibly burns. She is expected to recover. The blaze reportedly started on a fifth-floor terrace and took 70 firefighters to douse. Three families were evacuated.
