He further promised to bear the cost of the production. In the letter directed to the Lagos state government, he says: I hereby undertake to join the Lagos State campaign against the spread of the COVID-19 by making a free audio-visual publication towards the campaign against COVID-19 The letter is part of the conditions given for his release after flouting the government’s order prohibiting the gathering of more than 20 people due to Coronavirus outbreak by attending JJC Skillz’ birthday party. Naira Marley was not the only public figure involved. The former governorship candidate, Babatunde Gbadamosi and his wife, Folashade, were also arraigned on Wednesday before a Magistrates’ Court in Ogba for attending the birthday party. However, the court withdrew the four counts filed against them. The counts were withdrawn on the condition that the defendants would tender an apology to President Muhammadu Buhari and Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos. Other conditions are that they give the undertaking to comply with the COVID-19 regulations, and go into self-isolation for 14 days and report back to the court. This is not the first time Naira Marley would be dealt with by the law. On 10 May 2019, the EFCC arrested Naira Marley and his friends Zlatan, Tiamiu Kayode, Adewunmi Moses, and Abubakar Musa. The arrest was made a day after he released the video for the controversial single “Am I A Yahoo Boy”. Five days later, the EFCC released Zlatan and three others but kept Marley in their custody due to overwhelming evidence against him and 16th of May 2019, the EFCC charged him with 11 counts of fraud before a Federal High Court in Ikoyi, Lagos. His views about public issues are always controversial and often, they lead to social media uproar. Some times last month, the controversial artiste released a video saying he does not believe there is anything called coronavirus. This led to arguments. While in the midst of these, on Wednesday, 8th of April, 2020, the Marlian President was accused of broke shaming his fans on twitter. This led to more controversies.
