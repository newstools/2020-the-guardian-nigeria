Two persons died while another person was injured yesterday when two buses had a head-on collision at the Ile-iwe bus-stop, Idimu, in Alimosho Local Government Area (LGA) of Lagos State in spite of the ongoing lockdown. A Siena bus loaded with passengers had defied the government shutdown order and was on high speed when it ran into another oncoming bus.
 
It was gathered that the Siena bus was about to run into a stationary truck picking refuse and in an attempt not to run into it, ram into the government bus used by Alimosho LGA for the enlightenment campaign on the health implications of COVID-19.
 
On seeing the fatal nature of the accident, the driver of the refuse truck, rather than assist in rescuing the trapped occupants of the vehicles, zoomed off, but some angry commercial drivers and motorcycle operators, who suspected that it was the driver who caused the accident, chased after him.  “Again, in this type of situation, there was no police patrol vehicles on the road. If not for the intervention of God, the pandemonium would have escalated, because people are angry and looking for where to vent their anger. Even while I was mobilising people to assist in the rescue operations, they were interested in beating the driver of the refuse truck”. This is coming two days after an unregistered Dangote Cement truck crushed six persons in a taxi to death at Epe Long-bridge, Epe area of the state. The taxi and the truck were operating despite a lockdown imposed on Lagos by the federal government to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA) said the accident involved the Dangote truck and a commercial taxi conveying seven persons on Tuesday at about 7:00 p.m. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
