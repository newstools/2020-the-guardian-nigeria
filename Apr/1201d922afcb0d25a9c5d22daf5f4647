• Scholars recommend applied growth solution to curb Nigeria’s drift Nigerians may have to brace for tougher times earlier declared by the nation’s economic managers, once the lockdown is relaxed, as the realities of global supply chain disruptions, pressure on Naira as a result of demand for foreign exchange for the importation of petrol, food and other commodities are expected to further spike inflationary trend.
   
For the seventh consecutive month, Nigeria’s headline inflation rose at a faster pace, expanding by six basis points in March 2020 to 12.26 per cent year-on-year (February: 12.20 per cent y/y), representing the highest level of price growth since April 2018.
On a month-on-month (m/m) basis, the headline inflation increased slightly by five basis points to 0.84 per cent.
   
According to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the lock down in Abuja, Lagos and Ogun states and various major disruptions in normal economic activity in several states that started in April 2020, could not have had any major impact on March 2020 Inflation.
   
However, with the removal of subsidy, disruptions in global supply chains as a result of the raging pandemic, fall in oil prices, leading to drastic drop in government revenues, industry observers expect further rise in inflation in the months to come.  The Group’s recommendation is contained in an Advocacy Position Paper to the Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo-led Economic Sustainability Committee, set up by the Federal Government to seek for solution to abate economic drift in Nigerian.
   
In the paper exclusively obtained by The Guardian, yesterday, in Abuja, the Group called for a new development strategy because of the belief that unconventional solutions to big economy problems are not produced by economics, but by collective wisdom of gifted thinkers and intellectual capacity, which will jointly usher the economy into a new growth height that is sustainable which then restores real peace and inclusive prosperity in the country. The Coalition said: “We must open our knowledge space to new knowledge, just like the US did during the Great Depression. What our dear country Nigeria needs now to end this complicated economic crises is a Fortified Version of Alternative to the orthodox development concept called Applied Growth Solution (AGS); and it must be adopted through broad national engagement that will involve five levels of stakeholder communities.”
On month-on-month basis, the Headline index increased by 0.84 percent in March 2020. This is 0.05 percent higher than the rate recorded in February 2020 (0.79 percent).  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
