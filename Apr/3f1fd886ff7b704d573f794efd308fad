The need to treat seafarers with “dignity and respect” during COVID-19 crisis has been emphasized by the International Labour Organisation (ILO).The ILO urged that the seafarers should be treated as ‘key workers’, and be exempted from travel restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic.
 
A joint statement by officers of a special ILO tripartite maritime committee of the Maritime Labour Convention (MLC, 2006), also called on ILO member States to do all that they can to facilitate the delivery of essential medical supplies, fuel, water, spare parts and provisions to ships. 
 
The tripartite committee, which represents seafarers, ship owners and governments, reported that in some parts of the world suppliers have been prevented from boarding ships to give masks, overalls and other personal protective equipment to crews.	 According to the statement, ports in some parts of the world have also refused to allow some ships to enter because they had previously docked in areas affected by COVID-19, preventing vessels from obtaining essential supplies.
