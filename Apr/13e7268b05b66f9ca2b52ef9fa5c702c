Earlier in the day, the news of popular actress Funke Akindele hosting a birthday party for her husband, JJC Skillz, despite the government’s ban on social gatherings, went viral. In a now-deleted tweet, the actress defended the decision to host the party in response to a Nigerian who stated that losing her endorsement, as a result, will be due to “plain stupidity” and not a matter of “witch hunt”. According to Akindele, the attendees of the birthday were ‘already camped in Amen Estate due to ongoing production of #omoghettothesaga” Following the major backlash online, she later released a video explaining why the party held and tendered an apology. However, Lagos State Police Command arrested the popular later on Sunday. The police also said Funke Akindele’s husband JJC Skillz, Naira Marley and others who attended the party will be declared wanted if they do not turn themselves in on Monday. Police spokesman Bala Elkanah said: “Police detectives from the State CID Yaba were promptly drafted to the location. Funke Akindele was arrested. “Investigation is ongoing, efforts are intensified to arrest the remaining persons in the video, among whom are Azeez Fashola a.k.a Naira Marley and Abdul Rasheed Bello a.k.a. JJC Skillz. “They are in their best interests urged to report at the State CID Yaba on Monday 6th April, 2020 or risk being declared wanted.”
