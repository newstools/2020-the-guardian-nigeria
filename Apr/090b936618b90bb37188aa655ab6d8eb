A woman, Faith Obinna, who recently gave birth to twins at St. Raphael Divine Mercy Hospital in Ikorodu area of Lagos State yesterday, accused the hospital management of allegedly stealing one of her twins immediately after birth. The victim, who reportedly did several scans in the same hospital, which revealed that she was pregnant of twins, claimed she was sedated on the day she had a caesarean section and was later presented with only one of the twins. Also, in the Obstetric scan report dated 26: 02: 2020 and which has the doctor’s name as Otutuoja seen by our reporter, indicated that the number of fetus in Faith were Twins, but the “suspected sex”, read “XY and ?” Her call for help via a voice note had last week gone viral with the mother of two pleading with well-meaning Nigerians and non governmental organizations to come to her aid as she search for her missing baby. While calling for immediate help from well-meaning Nigerians and the government of Lagos State, she said: “I delivered on 6th March at Saint Raphael hospital, I had caesarean section because I was pregnant for twins. Before the cesarean session, I had done three scans in the same hospital, which confirmed I was pregnant with twins. “On the day of the caesarean section, we were three women who delivered their babies through caesarean section. I was the only one they gave sleeping injection even when I told the doctor before the time not to administer it but they did so that I won’t know when they took my baby but when they brought the two babies out I was still partially conscious because of the injection.” However, the hospital through a management worker who pleaded for anonymity explained that the lady gave birth to a baby and not a set of twins.
