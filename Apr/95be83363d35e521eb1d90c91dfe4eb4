The monarch disclosed this while speaking with journalists in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, shortly after he donated two motorised modular fumigators to the state government. Oba Ogunwusi, who stated the donation of the mechanical fumigators was his own contribution to the state government’s efforts at combating the pandemic, said that he had gone far in working with the traditional medicine practitioners in the country to ensure a solution for Coronavirus. He said though scientific solutions were being sought globally to end the pandemic, traditional medicine and solutions must also be considered and embraced as a way out of COVID-19. The Ooni, therefore, urged the Federal Government to emulate Madagascar in its quest to use local herbs in combating Coronavirus, declaring that local herbs have the potency to heal victims of the virus. In his remarks, Ogun State Governor Dapo Abiodun commended the monarch for the gesture and assured him that the fumigators would be put to good use. Abiodun said the state was open to ideas and activities capable of finding a solution to the virus. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
