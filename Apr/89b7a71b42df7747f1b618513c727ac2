His family in a released statement said he died of heart complications. His death certificate obtained by TMZ has stated the exact cause of the legend’s death. According to the document, Bill Withers died of a cardiopulmonary arrest caused by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and bradyarrhythmia. The death certificate also confirms that Bill died on March 30 at 10:44 AM at Providence Tarzana Regional Medical Centre. Bill’s death was announced by his family in a statement earlier this month, with the three-time Grammy winner known for iconic hits including Lean On Me and Ain’t No Sunshine. The statement by the family reads: We are devastated by the loss of our beloved, devoted husband and father. A solitary man with a heart-driven to connect to the world at large, with his poetry and music, he spoke honestly to people and connected them to each other. As private a life as he lived close to intimate family and friends, his music forever belongs to the world. In this difficult time, we pray his music offers comfort and entertainment as fans hold tight to loved ones. He was awarded Grammys as a songwriter for Ain’t No Sunshine in 1971 and for Just The Two Of Us in 1981. In 1987, Bill received his ninth Grammy nomination and third Grammy as a songwriter for the re-recording of 1972 hit Lean On Me by Club Nouveau. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2015 by Stevie Wonder. Withers thanked his wife as well as the R&B pioneers who helped his career like Ray Jackson, Al Bell, and Booker T. Jones. His music has been sampled and covered by such artists as Blackstreet’s No Diggity, Will Smith’s version of Just The Two Of Us, Black Eyed Peas’ Bridging The Gap, and Twista’s Sunshine.
