Renewed buying interest in some highly capitalised stocks on the equities sector of the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) yesterday, lifted the market capitalisation further by N77 billion. Specifically, the All-Share Index (ASI) increased by 148.07 absolute points, representing a decline of 0.71 per cent to close at 21,073.26 points. Similarly, the market capitalisation rose by N77 billion to close at N10.982 trillion. The uptrend was impacted by gains recorded in large and medium capitalised stocks, amongst which are; Lafarge Africa, Dangote Sugar Refinery, Stanbic IBTC Holdings, Flour Mills Of Nigeria, Ecobank Transnational Incorporated (ETI). Analysts at Afrinvest Limited said: “We do not expect to see a sustained bullish run although investors have continued to seek bargain hunting opportunities.” The Chief Operating Officer of InvestData Consulting Limited, Ambrose Omordion said that the seeming strength returning to the market after two months of decline induced globally by the Coronavirus pandemic at the peak of earnings reporting season has left many stocks attractive, following which they now offer high dividend yields. According to him, this has supported the improved traded volume, in spite of the on-going remote trading, and reveals that investors are taking advantage of the prevailing low prices to accumulate fundamentally sound stocks.
