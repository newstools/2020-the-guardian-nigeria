• Says His Release Can Only Be Approved By Court
The Independent Corrupt Practice and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) said it did not have the suspended Chairman of the defunct Special Presidential Investigation Panel, Chief Okoi Obono-Obla, under illegal and malicious detention. A press statement issued on social media and signed by one F. Baba Isah, Esq., claiming to be representing other unnamed counsel to Obono-Obla had accused the commission of detaining his client illegally. Obono-Obla was arrested on March 20, 2020, by the Commission after months of refusal to honour request to appear for investigation on the allegations of sundry breaches of the Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Act, 2000 and Other Allied Criminal Statutes. ICPC, in a statement, yesterday in Abuja, by its Spokesperson, Rasheedat Okoduwa, said it was not true, as suggested in the press release, that he was being illegally detained, insisting that Obono-Obla’s release could only be approved by the court. Statement reads: “The Commission needs to put it on record that before his arrest, Chief Obono-Obla had been declared wanted and relevant law enforcement agencies were informed to arrest him, if found. That March 20, 2020, when he was eventually arrested by the Commission was a Friday, and none of his lawyers came for him, as alleged in the statement. “Access to him would definitely have been granted, if any lawyer had come on that day.…” “In order to ensure he was not illegally detained while investigation was still ongoing, the Commissioned obtained a Remand Order from the Federal High Court, Abuja, authorising his remand, pending conclusion of investigation and fixing return date for April 7, 2020…” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
