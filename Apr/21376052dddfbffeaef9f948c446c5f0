But less than 24 hours after, LASEPA reversed its decision. Other firms sealed by the agency on Wednesday include SPN Packaging Studio Press Nigeria Plc on Plot B, Israel Adebajo Close, Ikeja and Supreme Hotel in Agege. The action followed a tip-off that the firms’ directed their workers to resume duties despite the stay at home order announced by the president. At SPN Packaging Studio Press Nigeria Plc, the enforcement team ordered the Chinese and some Nigerians out of the factory before sealing the company, while at Supreme Hotel, no fewer than 60 sex workers and their clients were chased out of the hotel. General Manager of LASEPA, Dr. Dolapo Fasawe, noted that the safety of the workers are premium to the government and warned owners of industrial facilities to desist from locking their staff and holding the keys. She urged Lagosians to abide by the safety directive of stay at home to control the spread of the pandemic.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
