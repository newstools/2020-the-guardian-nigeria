This has been asserted to be false by AFP. Experts have said that 5G is based on radio frequency and that this does not create viruses according to AFP. This claim was recently amplified by popular American singer Keri Hilson who asserted that coronavirus is caused by fifth-generation wireless technology, known as 5G. Below are some reactions to this claim of 5G causing coronavirus by some Nigerians: Mr. President, Do NOT allow 5G in Nigeria & if you have already done so burn it. Do NOT accept face masks & other accessories from the Chinese to help prevent coronavirus. Do NOT accept help from Chinese doctors. Do NOT accept any anti-Coronavirus vaccines from ANYONE. — Femi Fani-Kayode (@realFFK) April 4, 2020      5G is Definitely not the Cause of Covid 19 as speculated in your WhatsApp Voice Note but some report shows it could be Def Dangerous to Human Health.
