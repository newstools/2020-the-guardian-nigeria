Not only has Instagram decided to lift Tory Lanez’ ban on going Live for his ‘Quarantine Radio’, but he has also released his highly anticipated project The New Toronto 3. Lanez has been hyping this album for weeks and recently shared the tracklist that only houses two features from Mansa and Lil Tjay. Aside from entertaining over three hundred thousand Instagram users with his Live sessions, Tory Lanez has spent some time reflecting on his discography.

He noted that Chixtape 5 was the closest he’s come to giving all of himself creatively—that is, until The New Toronto 3’s arrival. See the tracklist and stream The New Toronto 3 below: 1.
