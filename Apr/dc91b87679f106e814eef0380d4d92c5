Mother, two daughters killed in kerosene explosion in Rivers
It was a black day last Saturday, April 25, as three sisters drowned in a river at Amaeze village in Ishiagu community of Ebonyi State. The death of the girls, between the ages of 14 and 20 still remains a mystery to residents of the village. The three sisters who attended Comprehensive Secondary School in Ishiagu, were found floating on the water. Their bodies have been buried beside the stream without caskets, as culture and tradition demands. The Divisional Police Officer (DPO) of Ivo Divisional Police Post, Mr. Nwornu Daniel, confirmed the incident and said it was a case of “sudden and unnatural death.” Meanwhile, two siblings and their mother yesterday lost their lives in a kerosene explosion at Aliko Estate in Choba community of Obio/Akpor Local Government Area, Rivers State. The Guardian gathered that the incident occurred at about 8:00a.m. on Tuesday and that the Police Divisional Headquarters in the area have moved the bodies of the victims to the morgue. The explosion was suspected to be as a result of adulterated kerosene. The state police public relations of the command, DSP Nnamdi Omoni, said he is aware of the incident, but noted that the information he has on it was still sketchy. However, it was gathered from sources around the area that husband to the late woman had left the room earlier, locked it and left with the keys before the incident occurred. One of the neighbours, who craved anonymity, alleged that the stove the late woman was using to cook had exploded with no way for the victims to escape from the locked building. The neighbour said the three victims burnt to death in the locked room, adding that property were also destroyed in the fire.
