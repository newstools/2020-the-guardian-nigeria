Few underwriting companies in Nigeria’s insurance industry are considering tapping into opportunities in the real estate sector, which valuers estimated to worth about N59trillion under a post-recapitalisation era.
  
The Guardian learnt that although real estate investment is not admissible as a part of the paid-up capital in the ongoing exercise, insurers perceive property as another investment haven.
Many operators after the regulatory-induced recapitalisation will have enough funds at their disposal to invest in profitable sectors, to give good returns to their shareholders.
  
In the current exercise, the National Insurance Commission (NAICOM), had raised the minimum paid-up share capital of a Life insurance company from N2billion to N8billion; Non-Life insurance from N3billion to N10billion and Composite insurance from N5billion to N18billion.  “We took the big decision to sell the property, which we did at a very handsome price. And just in one swoop, it resolved many issues. We now have a significant amount of liquidity. We don’t have the headache of recapitalisation, and we have done what the regulator wants, which is to convert any property to cash,” he added.
