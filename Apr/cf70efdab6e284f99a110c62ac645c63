Maikaba Plateau United Coach, Abdu Maikaba, has disclosed that he is not aware that the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) has concluded plans to make him the new head coach of the National U-20 team. Recently, some media outlets reported that the former Kano Pillars coach was in line to be announced as the new coach of the Flying Eagles. Maikaba told The Guardian yesterday that he was pleasantly surprised when he heard the news, adding, however, that nobody from the NFF has officially contacted him on the appointment.

My target is to win the NPFL, which I have not won before as a coach. That is why I am working with players that are hungry like me to achieve the feat,” he said.
