The rapper’s lawyer, Bradford Cohen, filed legal documents claiming the rapper who is in prison awaiting his murder trial is suffering from severe chills, heavy labored breathing, headaches, and body aches since he tested positive for the coronavirus. Cohen says Melly weighs 114 pounds and has not been monitored by medical personnel every hour like they’re supposed to. Cohen claims Melly’s been holed up in a cell with another inmate who also has COVID-19 and there’s fear “if the virus can be mutated or passed reoccurring between individuals.” Cohen claims the there’s a lack of preparedness by the jail for this type of epidemic as “they have not given them masks, or cleaning supplies that would be beneficial regarding his recovery. This is against all recommendations of the Surgeon General and CDC.” Melly is asking the judge if he can get out of prison, be placed on house arrest and treated at a medical facility at his own expense. Melly has been sitting in a Florida jail for more than a year after being arrested and charged in the double murder of two of his friends. Melly is an American rapper, singer, and songwriter from Gifford, Florida. He is best known for his songs “Murder on My Mind” and “Mixed Personalities” featuring Kanye West. His single “Murder on My Mind” is considered YNW Melly’s breakout, which garnered even further attention after the rapper was charged with double-murder.
