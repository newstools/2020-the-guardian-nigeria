Naira Marley Controversial Nigerian musician Azeez Fashola popularly known as Naira Marley was recently arrested by the Nigerian Police Force for attending a house party. The house party was hosted by Nollywood actress Funke Akindele in celebration of her husband JJC Skillz’s 43rd birthday. However, the party flouted the government’s order of social distancing during the ongoing novel coronavirus pandemic that has caused lockdown in parts of the country. When video clips from the party surfaced on social media, many slammed all those in attendance for not only flouting the rules but setting back the government’s fight against the pandemic. Funke Akindele was arrested and arraigned in court alongside her husband. The celebrity couple was sentenced to 14-days community service and a fine of N100,000 each. The police also asked Naira Marley and a Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chieftain Babatunde Gbadamosi to turn themselves in or risk being declared wanted. Naira Marley turned himself in at the State Criminal Investigation Department, Panti, Yaba, Lagos State. The Defence Counsel, Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa (SAN), on Tuesday, withdrew the four counts filed against Naira Marley and Gbadamosi on the condition that the defendants would tender an apology to President Muhammadu Buhari and the Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu. Following the incident, Naira Marley has now broken his silence with a tweet on his Twitter page. He tweeted: “Snitches on Twitter will get you arrested and still want you to fight the government for them. “From now on it’s just Marlians only. Let’s all listen to the government and give them our full support.” This is not Naira Marley’s first run in with the law. He was famously arrested in 2019 by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFFC) in connection with cybercrime popularly known as yahoo yahoo. He was subsequently arraigned in court where he pled not guilty to the charges against him.
