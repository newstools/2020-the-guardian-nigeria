Residents of Ije-Ododo community in Alimosho council area have appealed to the Lagos State Government to allow the Eko Distribution Company effect repairs on electrical infrastructure damaged by the explosion at Abule Ado over a month ago so that power supply can be restored to the community. Speaking with The Guardian, Chairman Abule Ayi community development association (CDA), Ije Ododo, Pastor Segun Babatunde called on the government to give the distribution company permission to effect repairs and restore power supply to the area. Babatunde said over a month after the explosion, the community, which borders Abule Ado, has been in darkness as residents continue to grapple with challenges amidst the Federal Government lockdown directive. “We went to the distribution company, and they told us that the state government is the one delaying them. They said they are waiting for a letter from the government to give them the green light to commence repairs,” he said. The community leader, however, condemned the fact that residents were billed for the one-month power outage and also given outrageous amounts as charges for the same period. He called on the government to ease their pain by allowing repairs to be done, saying scarce resources meant for food are now used in buying fuel for generators.
