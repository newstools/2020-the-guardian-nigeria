Blueface | Image: XXL Magazine American rapper Blueface was shooting a music video at his California home on Saturday when a fight broke out among the bikini-clad strippers he had invited. Blueface, in spite of the coronavirus lockdown and social distance restrictions, had invited a number of people to his house for a video shoot. The “Thotiana” rapper posted some footage from the shoot on his Instagram story, showing off video vixens dancing for the camera. Soon the mood changed as a verbal fight between some of the vixens turned physical. “It’s going up!” Blueface said as he, narrated the fight on his Instagram page. “They going viral.” The women were eventually separated but continued threatening each other with violence. In another clip captured on IG, one woman ripped the wig off another, causing a whole scene. Later on, more women are grappling on the floor as security tries to break them up. Following the events, the young woman whose wig was snatched off explained on her twitter page that she had been a victim of a racist attack and that the girl who had snatched off her wig had done so because she was talking with Blueface while the other girls were fighting. Blueface later took to his Instagram stories to clarify the issue. He said that the girls were not fighting over him, but the commotion was caused by a combination of “henny” and “attitude”. “They were not fighting over me it was a lot of henny mixed with alil atitude I have not had relations with any of these women no one was being racist more than half of the people here was black so if you that your to invested in the internet alil to much.”
