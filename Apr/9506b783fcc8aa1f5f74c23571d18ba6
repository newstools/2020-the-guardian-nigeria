GETTY IMAGES NORTH AMERICA/AFP Monaco will reduce spending on the royal household by 40 percent to cope with the coronavirus fallout in the principality on the French Riviera, the palace said on Wednesday. “The gravity of the situation demands rigorous financial management… that leads to an overall reduction in state expenses,” the palace said in a statement. As a result, the allocation for the royal living expenses will fall to eight million euros ($8.7 million) from 13.2 million euros before the crisis. Head of state Prince Albert II tested positive for COVID-19 last month, though he came out of quarantine on March 31.
