Life is gradually returning to pre-COVID-19 lockdown in Lagos State, The Guardian observed yesterday, which shows that Lagosians are tired of staying at home without food after more than three weeks of the lockdown. At Iyana Ipaja yesterday, commercial vehicles were seen plying Oke-odo, Abule-egba, Kola, Toll Gate, Sango, Ifo among others to Oshodi. Also, motorcycles lined up as before the clampdown on February 1, looking for passengers. While some vehicles going towards Sango took inner-city roads to beat some police checkpoints, some dared the consequences to pass through the roadblocks manned by policemen and soldiers. A passenger travelling to Ogun State from Iyana Ipaja said: “If they extend this lockdown, the government should be ready to face civil disobedience from hungry Nigerians. By the time people start revolting and leave their homes to go about their businesses, I would see whether the government would force them back into their houses” he said. Another civil servant, simply called Adeola, said: “From what we can see, the government is pushing people to revolt. When they are talking of poorest of the poor, the vulnerable among others, how do you define those that are vulnerable after one month of commercial inactivity?”.
