Shatta Wale | Wuzup Nigeria Ghanaian musician, Shatta Wale in an interview with 4 Style TV has condemned pastors collecting tithes and offerings online during the coronavirus pandemic. According to the singer, such pastors are not concerned about the salvation and welfare of their congregation but care about money instead. He said; “We are in a period where I don’t think pastors should even try that…you understand me? Your members come to church and they give collection, now there is a problem. The collections they gave like for the past 30 years, where are those collections? “okay like you can say your collections for the past 30 years, where can I buy some rice or yam or things for you. but as at now that Coronavirus is killing your church members, some of your church members don’t even have cars, some don’t have houses…they rent and you’re still collecting tithes online? “These are scammers like hard sakawa guys and that’s why some people like Kennedy Agyapong will get pissed and start bombarding them. As a man of God, don’t you have pity?” Shatta Wale earlier announced on Twitter that he has plans to rent some of his houses for a virtual concert for those who want to perform this Easter with equipment. He asked those interested to link up as he also revealed that he will be giving away some foodstuffs to some of “these foolish hungry fans.” In a follow-up tweet, he went on a rant about how being a musician is similar to doing a toilet job. He tweeted: “To be a musician is just doing a toilet job ,it’s full of shit and worms …No hygiene..Tell the upcoming ones cuz this shitdustry always have their favorite..Fuck dem !!!” Born Charles Nii Armah Mensah Jr., the reggae-dancehall artist is best known for his song “Dancehall Kin.g” The song won him Artiste of the Year at the 2014 edition of the Vodafone Ghana Music Awards.
