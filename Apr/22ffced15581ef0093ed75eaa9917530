 Omoboriowo  No doubt, pushing music PR appears to be a turf Omoboriowo is famously familiar with, after amassing a clientele list, which includes the likes of Davido, Toby Grey, Yonda and others.
Speaking during an interactive session to herald his 2020 plans, Omoboriowo disclosed that his ambition and a knack for getting things done have stood his company out and attracted success to him. He informed that he knew what life would be like as a young man and kept his game tight; never licked ass for anyone to get to the top despite many reasons to compromise. The dark and tall dude, who built his PR Company from scratch, said one of the things that helped him in life is sincerity and not giving up. “Sincerity and passion matter in all one does. It is not by accident that Scoop Media Concepts is fast becoming a household name. We don’t joke with our clients and make sure that they are very happy working with us. That matters a lot in business, whether in Nigeria or overseas.” On his relationship with world’s heavyweight boxer, Anthony Joshua, Omoboriowo disclosed that he currently handles his PR and promotions in Nigeria and UK, adding that he would reveal much about the deal in due time.
