According to the right groups, the funds being spent under the NCT programme belongs to the public, but the framework for the compilation of the households that qualify to receive the payments and be in the Social Register is not in the public domain.  “There is a statutory obligation under Section 48 (1) of the Fiscal Responsibility Act for full transparency in the management of public expenditure and revenues.
 
“It says, ‘The Federal Government shall ensure that its fiscal and financial affairs are conducted in a transparent manner and accordingly, ensure full and timely disclosure and wide publication of all transactions and decisions involving public revenues and expenditures and their implications for its finances’.  They maintained that for fund to be spent under the COVID-19 Response Programme, it must be appropriated according to Section 80 and 81 of the 1999 Constitution, stating that the National Assembly is yet to enact a Framework Law for a meaningful response to COVID-19 pandemic.
