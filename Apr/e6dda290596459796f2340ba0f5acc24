Adekunle Gold and Don Jazzy Nigerian singer Adekunle Gold is on many fronts a successful man as he has amassed not only fame but also wealth that many can only dream of. To imagine that only nine years ago, the “Sade” hitmaker was begging Mavin Records Don Jazzy for jobs on social media. At the time, Don Jazzy was in charge of the now-defunct music label MoHits Records and Adekunle Gold was asking to be a graphics designer for the label. Sharing screenshots of messages he sent to Don Jazzy on Twitter, Adekunle Gold reveals how mortified he is with the names he called Don Jazzy. From “Mohits Lord” to “Dad,” the aspiring talent at the time described himself as a “graphic artist of magnitude” and begged to be employed as the “official album art designer of Mohit stars” The “Ire” crooner didn’t stop there as he also sent links to some of his songs to Don Jazzy for the music mogul to listen to. The expectant father said he decided to share the messages when he came across them recently. According to him, he wanted to send Don Jazzy a message earlier this year when he came across the messages from nine years back. Speaking of his embarrassment, he said: “I wanted the ground to swallow me.” Below are the messages.
