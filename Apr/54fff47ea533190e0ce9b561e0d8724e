 Former Fiji prime minister Laisenia Qarase PHOTO: Getty images  The founder of the Soqosoqo Duavata Ni Lewenivanua Party, who served as Fijiâ€™s sixth prime minister from 2000 to 2006, died in hospital after a short illness. Qarase passed away at the Oceania Hospital in Suva early Tuesday, family spokesman Mesake Koroi told AFP. He was a career civil servant who was appointed prime minister in 2000 after the military quashed a coup by failed businessman George Speight that had removed the government of Mahendra Chaudhry. Qarase was a champion of indigenous Fijians and won two elections without gaining any significant support from the Indo-Fijian population. In 2006, he was removed from power in a military coup led by Frank Bainimarama and later imprisoned on corruption charges.
