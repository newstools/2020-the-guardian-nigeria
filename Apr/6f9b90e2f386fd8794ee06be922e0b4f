 Since the lockdown came into effect last week, there have been increased incidents of street boys . Photo: GETTYIMAGES  A victim narrated his ordeal thus: “They first start with begging, if you freely part with money, you won’t be harassed; but if you decide to ignore them, you will not only be assaulted but your phones, money and any valuables will be confiscated from you unchallenged. I was lucky because I bailed myself with N500 even before they could start their harassment.”  “We do arrest the few we can but they come back within three days after their release. The ones we charge to court are released because the court says they cannot remand them into custody because of COVID-19; that is the challenge we are facing now. If we keep them in our cell, they may spread the virus and the IGP has directed against detaining people during this period.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
