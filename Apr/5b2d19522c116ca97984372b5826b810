Bauchi State Government has disagreed with the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) over two new cases it recorded for it on the health agency’s portal. On Wednesday, NCDC has confirmed that Bauchi has recorded another two new cases in addition to existing six index cases who are currently receiving treatment. The state’s deputy governor Baba Tela claimed that there was “an error from the state and NCDC,” noting that there was no new case of Covid-19 in Bauchi. “From the samples that were sent to Abuja for testing as part of the evaluation of the existing cases, two came out remain positive and were recorded as new ones for us,” Tela said. “The mistake was that it wasn’t tagged as follow up sample of those who are under treatment. And they didn’t tell us how to tag them. It was later they said we should have included the details of the hospitals and where the samples are coming from.” He said that the government has written formally to NCDC to correct the mistake they jointly made. “We have been having three cases in Bauchi, later they (NCDC) added three, that made it six. We didn’t accept the three cases because there were discrepancies in the result, though we have had underground communication with them,” Aliyu Maigoro, who is the commissioner for health in the state said. “After clarification from them, they realised that only one case was positive (out of the last three cases)–who is on admission now. The remaining two are negative. And if you look at the previous data, we have only four cases on admission, we have been saying that we only have four patients in our hospital who are on admission,” he explained.
