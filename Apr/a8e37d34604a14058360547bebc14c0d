The Lagos Government on Friday said it has not relaxed the lockdown in the state for the Easter celebrations. “Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu has not relaxed any lockdown. The lockdown is still on and we enjoin Lagosians to continue to obey the directive; to continue to be responsible,” Lagos State information and strategy commissioner Gbenga Omotosho said during a joint ministerial press briefing. “That is the only way the experts have said we can fight this disease.” Nigeria President Muhammadu Buhari on Sunday, March 29th 2020, announced a 14-day lockdown on Lagos, Ogun State and Abuja to curb the spread of coronavirus. Buhari also directed the closure of businesses in Lagos, Ogun State and Abuja. However, as the lockdown entered its 11th day, there were rumours that the government had lifted the lockdown for citizens to celebrate Easter. Refuting the rumours, Omotosho said relaxing the lockdown may hamper the progress made so far in the fight against coronavirus. “We don’t want to just allow the gains of the moment; the gains that we have made, to be eviscerated by just the enjoyment of a few days,” Omotosho said. Omotosho said the extension or relaxation of the lockdown is within the purview of the Nigerian Government. “If it is going to be extended or relaxed, it is the business of the Federal Government. The announcement is not going to be made by Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu because he did not impose it in the first place,” Omotosho said. The police on Thursday advised Nigerians not to defy the coronavirus prevention of staying at home and social distancing during Easter celebration. The inspector general of police Mohammed Adamu in a statement said all preventive measures against the spread of coronavirus by states and the federal government are still in effect regardless of events.
