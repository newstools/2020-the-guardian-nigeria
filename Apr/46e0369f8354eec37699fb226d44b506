The General Overseer, Christ Mercyland Deliverance Ministry Inc, Prophet Jeremiah Omoto Fufeyin, yesterday, challenged wealthy pastors across the continent, especially Nigerians to assist the poor in order to mitigate the challenges posed by Covid-19. Fufeyin, who gave about N800m to the less privileged, insisted that Nigerians has given so much to the church and it was only fair that wealthy pastors give back in these trying times. The Prophet disclosed that he last assisted the Federal Government and member of his church with about N300 million, bringing his total donation to N1.2 billion. Fufeyin, who is also the President Of Jeremiah Omoto Fufeyin (JOF) Foundation, stated that the Federal Government needs the support of well-meaning Nigerians, especially wealthy clergymen to mitigate challenges faced by poor citizens. In a chat with The Guardian, the cleric said: “Nigerians need the Church now more than ever before, and I am challenging all Nigerian billionaire clergymen like myself to come out and do something to the benefit of Nigerians. “If you are a billionaire Prophet, Pastor, Apostle or Bishop, this is the best time to show yourself by helping the needy find relief during this global burden in our land.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
