Since The Weeknd’s After Hours turned out really good, what other better move to make than lending his talents to the TBS animated series American Dad. According to IMDB, the title of the episode is “A Starboy Is Born”. Earlier in April, the Canadian superstar, real name Abel Tesfaye, posed alongside American Dad and Robot Chicken writer Joel Hurwitz via Instagram for his special television announcement, plus a short quarantine PSA. “Me and this guy wrote an episode of American Dad. Also gonna play myself… kinda. MAY 4th ! (Photo was taken a while ago… STAY HOME),” the 30-year-old artiste wrote. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1150399 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/the-weeknd-american-dad.jpeg" alt="" width="1080" height="608" /> The three-time Grammy-winning singer has been sharing teasers since the beginning of the week. “May 4th. A Starboy is Born,” he wrote in one tweet.  In another, he shared a look at his American Dad character. Deadline reports that the episode will also feature an original song by The Weeknd, and pop group Electric Guest took to Twitter on April 29 to write: “I wrote & produced a song w @theweeknd & Joel Hurwitz. It comes out on @AmericanDadTBS next week on the 4th. I don’t have a tv but if u do, tune in. It’s a whopper, a real banger.” Season 16 of American Dad returned to TBS on April 13, with fellow guest stars Jane Lynch, Bill Nye, Criss Angel, Craig Robinson, Patton Oswalt, and Ron Perlman.
