Plans are underway by the Nigeria Social Insurance Trust Fund (NSITF) to develop a platform for self-appraisal of staffers in its bid to boost efficiency of its workers. 
 
The Managing Director/Chief Executive of the Fund, Adebayo Somefun, who disclosed this in Abuja, explained that the conference organised by the NSITF in Uyo, Akwa Ibom state which had, ‘NSITF: In pursuit of corporate growth and contribution to national development’ as a theme, was organised to help the Board and management shape the policy direction of the Fund. 
 
He explained: “The main objectives of the conference were to generate ideas that will ensure the sustainability of the Employees’ Compensation Scheme (ECS). It was also to help develop manpower competency and provide a platform for self-appraisal. The conference also enabled the board and management to engender team spirit and team building in the overall interest of the Fund. It also afforded us the opportunity to reflect and evaluate major aspects of the Fund’s operations in achieving its mission and vision.”
 
The NSITF boss highlighted that the conference recommended that trainings by the Fund should be based on NEEDS assessment and that the finance department should produce an all-encompassing accounting manual and software that can be easily assessable by the first quarter of 2020.
