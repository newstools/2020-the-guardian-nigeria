Kano State Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje on Monday directed investigation to ascertain the cause of the records tens of “unusual” deaths in the state. No fewer than 40 corpses were reportedly buried since the declaration of the lockdown at Dandolo cemetery in Dala local government area of the metropolis, against the unusual three and at most five corpses daily, The Guardian gathered. At Kofar Mozuga Cemetery also in the metropolis, the number corpses brought for burial on daily basis hit 10, a development begging for serious concern, Aminu Abubakar told The Guardian. Reacting to the development however, Commissioner for Information, Muhammad Garba who acknowledged the reported strange death told journalists that government has swing into action to examine the matter. Although, Garba disagreed that the sudden rise in the case of death in Kano is related to COVID-19 pandemic, he noted that Governor Ganduje has directed the state ministry of health to investigate. Also reacting to the development, director, Centre for Infectious Diseases Research, Bayero University, Kano, Professor Isa Abubakar Sadiq said research has not confirmed the development has anything to do with COVID-19 pandemic. The Public health Consultant stressed that information so far obtained from on the development indicated death of aged persons who might have suffered from severe age induced illness. ” What we have seen so far is more or less false and rumour because there is no scientific research to prove that the purported mass death was due to COVID-19 pandemic. “While investigation as directed by the government is still on, we stand to say the reports are false and it is meant to cause panic in the city. I did not subscript to the fact that there is unusual record of death. There are so many interest around and people are ready to generate unfounded stories”. Professor Isa noted.
