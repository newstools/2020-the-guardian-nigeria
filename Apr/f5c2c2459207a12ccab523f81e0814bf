The rapper’s ex, Sara Molina says Tekashi has shown little to no interest in reconnecting with their daughter, Saraiyah. Sara says she wasn’t expecting him to change suddenly, but she’s still disappointed by the radio silence. She is, however, grateful Tekashi’s mother is actively trying to keep a bond alive with the little girl. Sara says the daughter’s grandma has been in close contact over the past month. However, sources close to 6ix9ine said the only reason he has not reached out and attempted to connect yet is because he wants the coronavirus pandemic under control first, as he wants to put his child’s safety first. Also, Tekashi claims Sara’s begging to get back with him, suggesting he is afraid she is using their daughter as a ploy to reunite. At 18 years old, 6ix9ine conceived a daughter, Saraiyah (born October 29, 2015), with Sara Molina (born January 17, 1996). Tekashi 6ix9ine was involved in a child sex charge from 2015. In October 2015, he pled guilty to a felony count of use of a child in a sexual performance. He was charged with three counts of the offense after a February 2015 incident in which he had physical contact with a 13-year-old girl and later distributed videos of the incident online as part of a music video.
