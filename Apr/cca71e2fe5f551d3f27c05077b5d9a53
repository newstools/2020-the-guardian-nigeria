• ‘Similar Scenario With Polio About To Repeat Itself’ As Coronavirus continues to kill people globally, popular Kaduna-based Islamic scholar, Sheikh Abubakar Mahmoud Gumi has called for arrest and punishment of any Muslim cleric preaching to people, especially northerners, not to receive Coronavirus vaccine, should one be found. Gumi advised Muslim clerics to desist from misleading people not to take the vaccine if brought to Nigeria. Gumi said: “We Northerners shouldn’t behave the same way we did with polio myelitis, where people were misled into believing polio vaccine would prevent them from having children.” He said though the vaccine was yet to arrive, some persons were already claiming it would kill people, adding:  “That was how we did with polio.

If scientists find a cure for COVID-19, no Malam should preach to people to reject it.” Gumi warned the scourge was real, saying: “Everybody in the world is affected by this virus, regardless of religion and tribe. There’s no disease brought by Allah that has no cure. The world is searching for a cure. Islamic clerics among us are advising we should be careful and avoid any drug named as a vaccine to COVID-19, as Northerners could be given drugs that would kill them…” “I am saying that, if the government plans to vaccinate people, they should not reject it. No Mallam should scare people from taking the vaccine. We are very sure the government must have tested the drug and seen it to be okay for people to use. There are guidelines and procedures to determine the safety of vaccines. If  any Mallam is found doing so, he should be arrested and punished…” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
