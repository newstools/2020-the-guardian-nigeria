Ordinarily, the special address by President Muhammadu Buhari in which he handed out a further 14-day extension of COVID-19 pandemic lockdown should have been a briefing on the three aspects of the first two weeks’ clampdown on social activities in Abuja, Lagos and Ogun States. Perhaps because habits die hard, the president is used to his usual style of making declarations to the country, as was the practice during his days as military head of state. As such there was nothing indicative of his democratic presidency when he spoke to Nigerians yesterday but one.
  
Apart from the fact that his ‘fellow Nigerians’ opening reminded most adult Nigerians of the late General Sani Abacha’s epic coup speech of December 31, 1983, that ushered in the Buhari/Idiagbon junta, by reading his speech without as much as a minute’s space for Nigerians to interrogate his administration’s strategies or input, left much to be desired.  Extending the lockdown period by another 14-day stretch does not support that optimism, because as the president acquiesced, “the increase in a number of confirmed cases and deaths being reported across the world and in Nigeria specifically,” raises concerns.  In the coming days, Nigerians would want to know which institution has been in the custody of the social register as well as when last an enumeration or documentation was incidental to it. Perhaps, that would throw some light to the president versus National Assembly’s misgivings about the Special Intervention Programme (SIP).
  
Already, Nigerians have continued to supply the missing gaps in the president’s broadcast and their voices represent a lament over the leadership, structures and systems in the country. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
