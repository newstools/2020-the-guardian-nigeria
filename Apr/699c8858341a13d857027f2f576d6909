The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) yesterday said contrary to reports in some quarters, no decision had been taken to postpone the Edo and Ondo governorship elections on account of the COVID-19 outbreak. The commission also said it had not adjusted the timetable for the polls scheduled for September 19 and October 10 this year. The National Commissioner and Chairman of the Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye, made the clarification yesterday in a statement in Abuja. He said: “It will be recalled that the commission, on February 6, 2020, released the timetable and schedule of activities for the two elections. Since then, the timetable has not been adjusted. While we are mindful of the negative impact of the coronavirus, we are also monitoring the various efforts by the federal and state governments, health authorities and other stakeholders to contain the spread of, and eliminate COVlD-l9. “If and when the need arises to adjust the timetable for the elections, same will be conveyed to the public in the usual manner.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
