The Oyo State Muslim Community has urged the wealthy Muslims in the country to assist the masses at this critical time. The Muslim Community, in a statement signed by its Chairman, Alhaji Kule Sanni, said the wealthy should provide for people from their God-given resources and Allah would continue to enrich them as they provide for others. The group however, appealed to President Muhammad Buhari, to include Oyo State in the total lockdown directive, noting that Oyo State shares close proximity with Lagos State. “Inclusion of  Oyo State will enable our people to stay at home, reduce the spread of the infection and keep fatality low. Oyo residents deserve to benefit from the Federal Goverment COVID-19 relief programme,” it stated. The group also urged its Governor, Seyi Makinde, to urgently acquire an accurate and rapid diagnostic kit or meter for detection of COVID-19 in suspected persons;  procure disinfecting machines to disinfect our markets, public places and neighbourhoods” I stated. With the imposition of a curfew on residents, the Muslim community urged the state government to provide succour in the form of food and other relief materials at this time, as a palliative to the current situation. The group enjoined Muslims to obey advisories of governments at all levels and pray at home. “We can make Adhan, but include as-Salaatul fi buyutikum’(pray in your homes) to replace ‘Hayya. alas – salaah’ (come to prayer)” it stated. Muslims are further urged to supplicate to Allah to restore peace to the land. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
