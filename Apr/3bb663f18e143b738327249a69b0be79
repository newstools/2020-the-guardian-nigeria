• A’Ibom denies nine officials contracting disease Taraba, Kebbi, Ebonyi and Bayelsa states have recorded their index cases to make Nigeria’s tally hit 1,273 incidents. The North East state’s six occurrences, which had been confirmed by the state government and the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), have had their victims quarantined at the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) isolation centre located at Sibre in Ardo-Kola council area of Taraba. The Guardian learnt that the discovery ranked third among the 91 cases recorded in 16 states as announced late Sunday night by the NCDC. Disturbed by the development, Governor Darius Dickson Ishaku, yesterday, in a state broadcast in Jalingo said the patients were “among the 130 inter-state travellers from Bauchi, Kano, Jigawa, Borno, Ogun and Lagos states intercepted at our borders.” He added that the Taraba COVID-19 Task Force had “earlier intercepted on two occasions 65 and 59 persons from Ogun enroute Adamawa, and were allowed to proceed amid tight security.” Commending the proactive steps of the committee which, according to him, “ led to the isolation and identification of the reported cases”, the governor assured the people that his administration was on top of the situation. In the same vein, Governor Atiku Bagudu has announced the first incidence in Kebbi State. Addressing reporters yesterday in Birnin Kebbi, he stated that of the 13 samples sent to the NCDC in Abuja, one tested positive for the virus. He said the 40-year-old victim had been isolated, while a team of medical experts was on the heels of the contacts. The governor urged the people to always observe the precautionary measures prescribed by the relevant authorities, including personal hygiene, hand washing, social distancing, use of facemasks and hand sanitisers to check the spread of the disease. Besides, Ebonyi has followed suite, recording its maiden case. Governor David Umahi identified the carrier as a 31-year-old man from Ukwu in Onicha Local Council of the state who runs a higher purchase business with his Siena vehicle with which he uses to convey food items to Ondo. He hinted that the affected indigene after selling the foodstuffs, transports passengers to the South East, adding that the man had made two trips this year. Umahi added that when he could not get passengers, he waited for days sleeping in motor parks and filling stations, stating that he was eventually arrested at Okposi Ohaozara council area by the chairman and handed him over to the police. The subsequent test on him proved positive while the ones on the other three persons in the vehicle came out negative. In Bayelsa, the Governor Douye Diri administration yesterday confirmed its index case as a woman. The middle-aged victim however rejected the result announced by the NCDC at about 10pm on Sunday, insisting that she is hypertensive diabetic. But the governor, who addressed a press conference yesterday in Yenagoa, confirmed the development, just as he announced a one-week stay-at-home for residents.
