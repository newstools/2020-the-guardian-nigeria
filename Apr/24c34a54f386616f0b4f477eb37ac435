Cases reduce to four in Oyo as another patient tests negative Osun State Governor Gboyega Oyetola at the weekend expressed delight that the remaining seven Cote d’Ivoire victims of the COVID-19 had responded positively to treatment and would soon be discharged. He said 10 of the 17 returnees had been discharged from the isolation centre in Ejigbo having been tested twice and proved negative for COVID-19 virus while seven persons remaining at centre are showing signs of improvement. The governor, who spoke while addressing journalists at the weekend, said the 10 patients had tested negative twice for the virus in line with the National Centre for Disease Control, (NCDC) protocol and had been released to reconnect with their families. Oyetola said the release of the 10 patients had brought to 11 the number of cases that had tested negative twice in the state. “The release of 10 patients today brings to 11 the number of cases that have tested negative twice and have been discharged after treatment in Osun State. “This development underscores our belief that COVID-19 isn’t a death sentence, but is treatable if the patients surrender themselves for treatment on time,” he said. In a related vein, Oyo State Governor Seyi Makinde at the weekend said that another Coronavirus patient in the state had been discharged.The discharge of this patient reduces the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the state to four. Makinde also said that the state had received a donation of 2,000 test kits from the Citizen for Citizen Initiative led by Mrs. Ibukun Awosika. The governor said: “One confirmed COVID-19 patient was discharged after receiving their second negative test result. This brings the number of discharged cases in Oyo State to six.   Another confirmed case requested a transfer to Lagos. So, there are four active cases in the state now. “We received a donation of 2,000 test kits from the Citizen for Citizen Initiative led by Mrs. Ibukun Awosika. This will be used in our planned drive-through and walk-through tests from next week. We are grateful to the Citizen for Citizen Initiative. “We also received donation of funds from the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control as well as medical supplies from IRASA Clothing Company. “Let me also use this opportunity to thank Chicken Republic, Dominos Pizza and all other organisations and individuals who have supported the state’s effort in preventing the spread of COVID-19 through donations in cash and kind.” He, therefore, urged the people of the state to abide by the directives of the Oyo State COVID-19 taskforce.
