Truck owners operating in the Mile 2-Tin Can Port axis along the Oshodi-Apapa Expressway, have assured of efficient service delivery during the lockdown period, even as they denied allegations of collecting money from trucks before allowing them access into the Lagos ports.
   
Spokesperson of the truck owners, Salami Ismail, said the petition against the real owners of articulated vehicles and the Presidential Task Team in the area was baseless.
  
Salami rather said the petitioners were not happy that their source of illegal fund was cut-off by the Presidential task team, which has been dealing directly with genuine truck owners in the task of ensuring that the two main access into Apapa are free of vehicular traffic.
   
He described those behind the petition as middlemen, who do not have trucks, but only seek to assist genuine truck owners to gain access into the port for a fee, a practice that has ended with the intervention of the Presidential task team. He pleaded with the law enforcement agencies to intervene and ensure that the falsehood being spread by the petitioners is curbed through detailed investigations of their activities.
