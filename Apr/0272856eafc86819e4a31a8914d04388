Lagos State Government on Sunday said only three local government areas in the state have not reported any case of coronavirus virus. The state health commissioner Professor Akin Abayomi disclosed during the COVID19 press briefing. Lagos has 20 local government areas. “There are three Local Govts where we have not identified any cases of COVID-19 yet and those are Ajeromi/Ifelodun, Epe and Ojo,” Abayomi said. Abayomi said, “the majority of cases are in the Lagos Mainland, followed by Eti-Osa, and running closely behind is Ikeja and we are beginning to see a bit of activity in Alimosho.” There are concerns of the virus spreading in Alismosho as it the largest Local Government Area in Lagos, according to the official 2006 Census conducted which reported over one million inhabitants in the area. The commissioner said the virus is now being transmitted within communities, therefore, he said the “latest strategy is active community case searching.” “We are no longer just waiting for people to present, we’re actually going into the community through all the Local Govts, door-to-door, trying to establish how many people may have the symptoms that are typical of COVID-19,” he said. On Saturday Lagos recorded 23 new cases to make a total of 306 cases in the state – the majority of the country’s 541 confirmed cases.
