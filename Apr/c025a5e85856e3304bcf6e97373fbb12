President Nana Akufo-Addo said the two-week restriction on movement around the capital Accra and in the Kumasi area would be prolonged from Monday. “It is important that we stay the course, and bear with the difficulties that come with it,” the leader said in a national broadcast late Thursday. “The final result, hopefully, will be freedom from the virus.” Authorities across Africa are weighing whether to extend anti-virus measures that have hit economies and cut off millions from vital sources of income.
