Founding member of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief Perekeme Kpodoh, has predicted victory for former Governor Seriake Dickson, if he emerges as the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate in the coming Bayelsa West Senatorial by-election in the state. Kpodoh told newsmen yesterday that Dickson, as a senatorial candidate, would have no problem winning the election for the PDP following his track records and his dogged political style. The former critic of the erstwhile governor said despite his disagreements with Dickson as governor, he would not hesitate to look at issues involving the former governor and his political capabilities objectively. He said, “It is not about the disagreements we had when he was a governor; it is about Dickson’s political sagacity and dogged style. He is the first to complete two terms as a governor (in Bayelsa). He also took development to his senatorial district when he was governor. 
“Look at how he dealt with our party and snatched our victory back to his party. Nobody can challenge him successfully in any election he is personally contesting. He is an enigma in politics,” Kpodoh said. Warning that any attempt to follow the decision of the petroleum minister in any election in Bayelsa would lead the APC to a disastrous end, he added: “In this coming senatorial election, the APC is not prepared. It is foolhardy challenging Dickson. It is better we support Dickson across party lines than wasting our time working for a Sylva candidate that will never win at the poll.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
