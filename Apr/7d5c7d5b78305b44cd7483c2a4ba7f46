Akindele and her husband AbdulRasheed Bello, also known as JJC Skillz, were convicted for hosting a birthday party in their Amen Estate home during the coronavirus lockdown. The court sentenced the couple to 14-day community service after they pleaded guilty to a one-count charge of violation of social distancing order preferred against them by Lagos State government. Singer Naira Marley and People’s Democratic Party’s chieftain and owner of Amen Estate Babatunde Gbadamosi escaped conviction after reaching a plea deal with the state government. Videos and pictures from the funeral of late Kyari showed tens of people in attendance during the Janazah prayer and actual burial without observance of social distancing. “Funke Akindele was arrested and arraigned for throwing a party in her house,” Oluwaseun Ayodeji Osowobi, a COVID-19 survivor said on Twitter. “Some politicians decided to organise a prayer session, hereby breaching the Presidential order & @NCDCgov guideline on social distancing, but no action will be taken because ‘proximity to power?’” More tweets are below:         To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
