The Joint Admission and Matriculation Board (JAMB) has disclosed that it has reinforced the Central Admission Processing System (CAPS) mobile app for all its admission related issues.
 
According to JAMB’s spokesman, Fabian Benjamin, candidates expecting admissions from any institutions need not visit any Computer Based Centre (CBT) or cyber cafe to check their admissions status for necessary action.
 
He said candidates are to login to the JAMB CAPS mobile app with the phone number they had used for the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) registration.  “After login, the candidate will then key in his registration number and click on enter to get started. A verification process would be carried out on the provided information and if successful, an OTP code would be sent to the provided mobile number. The candidate is to enter the code and click on verify to complete the verification exercise,” he said.
 
The spokesperson said upon the completion of verification, the candidate would be taken to the requisite admission page which has his/her admissions information to accept or reject the admissions offer, accept or reject transfer consideration by institutions that have if any, as well as accept or reject market place consideration by institutions. 
   
He said the candidate will also see their O’level results and other bio data. “If candidates accept their offers of admission, they are to proceed to register online for the requisite academic session in their institutions of choice,” he said. 
 
He advised candidates to take advantage of this mobile app to check their admissions status as JAMB workers are working from home to ensure that the public is adequately served and all processes are active. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
