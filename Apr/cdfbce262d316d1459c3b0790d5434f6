Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Umar Ganduje has ordered immediate sack of his Commissioner for Work and Infrastructure, Mu’azu Magaji. A statement signed by his Commissioner of Information, Muhammad Garba, said Mu’azu was removed due to his unguarded utterances on social media against  the late Chief of Staff to the President, Alhaji Abba Kyari. Garba said Ganduje was shocked over the commissioner’s comment, which he considered frightening for a public servant, who ought to have respected the sacredness of his office and refrained from act capable of bringing government to disrepute. Mu’azu’s comment, shortly after Abba Kyari’s death was announced, read: “Win win… Nigeria is free and Abba Kyari ya mutu a cikin annoba… Mutuwar shahada in Har da Imani mutum ya cika!” “Abba Kyari was no ordinary citizen. He amassed so much power and decided the fate of the nation and its people. Hence, his death is never a personal death.” “I am not a hypocrite and I won’t pretend! I pray Allah to grant Abba Kyari Jannah. I sincerely believe Nigeria needed a better CoS period…!” Garba said Governor Ganduje would not tolerate people in official capacities engaging in personal vendetta or otherwise, adding that the late Abba Kyari had led a life worthy of emulation by serving his country to the best of his ability.
