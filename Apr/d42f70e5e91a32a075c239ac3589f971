Oktoberfest Event Image Daily Mail  Germany has cancelled the Oktoberfest event scheduled for early October because of the novel coronavirus. Despite being a €1billion money-spinner, the southern state of Bavaria, which has suffered the brunt of the country’s outbreak, this morning pulled the plug on the event due to take place from September 19 to October 4 according to The Daily Mail. State governor Markus Soeder said after meeting Munich’s mayor on Tuesday: We agreed that the risk is simply too high. You can neither keep your distance nor work with facial protection at the Oktoberfest. The planet’s largest folk festival brings six million revellers to Berlin each year for a beer-fuelled fortnight of merriness and bands playing. The announcement came shortly after Germany reported new coronavirus cases rose by 1,785 to 143,457, marking a steady flow of infections. Scientists have pointed to rigorous testing and tracking regime as the root of Germany’s success in stemming the tide of infections. A ban on gatherings of more than two people and a requirement to stand more than 1.5 metres (5ft) apart from others in public areas remain in force. Cultural venues, bars, leisure centres, and beauty salons will also remain closed for the time being, while large-scale public events such as concerts and football matches have been banned until August 31. With larger shops unable to open, the German Trade Association warned on Friday of possible ‘distortion of competition’.
