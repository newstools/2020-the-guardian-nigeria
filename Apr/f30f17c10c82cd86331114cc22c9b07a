How to end terrorism in N’East, by Ndume
Armed bandits have invaded Karaukarau village in Giwa Council of Kaduna State and kidnapped three nursing mothers. A resident, Sani Bakali, said the hoodlums stormed the village on Tuesday afternoon during a wedding ceremony. “You know the curfew imposed as a result of the coronavirus had not been easy for the bandits, as they now have short supply of food. They now attack wedding venues and gatherings. “On this day, there was a wedding in our village and the hoodlums stormed the venue and took away 13 women.” He disclosed that when the villagers heard of it, they mobilised and confronted the bandits and rescued 10 of the women. When contacted, the Police image-maker, ASP, Muhammad Jalige, said the command was yet to be briefed about the attack. Meanwhile, Senator Ali Ndume (Borno South) has said that the military and Civilian JTF must collaborate with Operation Lafiya Dole to end Boko Haram in the North East. According to him, the synergy among fighting components could finally defeat Boko Haram terrorists that destroyed many lives and property in Borno, Adamawa and Yobe states. The Senate Committee Chairman on Army disclosed this on Wednesday at his Government Reservation Area (GRA) residence in Maiduguri. “I’m calling on people living in Sambisa Forest, Lake Chad Basin and tops of Mandara Mountains to provide useful information to the military to end this war,” he said, noting that the local residents had reliable information on Boko Haram hideouts.
