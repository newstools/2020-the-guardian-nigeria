Analysts predict gloomy outlook despite improved performance
Urges investors to increase stake in blue chips
After two months of decline induced globally by the ongoing Coronavirus pandemic, improved buying interest driven by bargain hunting in bellwether stocks last week lifted transactions on the equities sector of the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE). Consequently,  the  All-share index and market capitalisation appreciated by 1.37 per cent to close the week at 21,384.03 and N11.144 trillion respectively. All other indices finished higher with the exception of NSE Oil/Gas, NSE Lotus II and NSE Industrial Goods which depreciated by 4.76 per cent , 2.65 per cent and 6.59 per cent while NSE ASeM Index closed flat. The Coronavirus induced downturn at the peak of earnings reporting season has left many stocks attractive, following which they now offer high dividend yields. With stock prices hitting new 52-week, as well as between five and 11-year lows, discerning investors are taking advantage of the prevailing low prices to accumulate fundamentally sound stocks. A breakdown down of last weeks transactions showed that the Nigerian equities market reopened on a downturn on monday with N222 billion decline in market capitalisation. Specificalky, the All Share Index  fell by 425.24 points or 2.02 per cent to 20,669.38 points.    Accordingly, investors lost N222 billion in value as market capitalisation declined to  N10.772 trillion. The downturn was impacted by losses recorded in medium and large capitalised stocks, amongst which are; Seplat Petroleum Development Company (Seplat), Dangote Cement, BUA Cement, BOC Gases Nigeria and Nigerian Aviation Handling Company (NAHCO). However, equities rebounded on Tuesday, following price gains recorded by most bluechip stocks, causing market capitalisation to appreciate by  N133 billion. Precisely,  the ASI rose by 255.81 points or 1.24 per cent to 20,925.19 points. Also, investors gained N133 billion in value as market capitalisation went up to N10.905 trillion. The upturn was impacted by gains recorded in medium and large capitalised stocks, amongst which are; MTN Nigeria, Lafarge Africa, Zenith Bank, Custodian Investment and United Bank for Africa (UBA). At the close of trading on Wednesday, equities sustained positive trend as the capitalisation rose by N77 billion amid renewed bullish activity in high capitalised stocks. The All Share Index (ASI) increased by 148.07 absolute points, representing a decline of 0.71 per cent to close at 21,073.26 points. Similarly, the market capitalisation rose by N77 billion to close at N10.982 trillion. The uptrend was impacted by gains recorded in large and medium capitalised stocks, amongst which are; Lafarge Africa, Dangote Sugar Refinery, Stanbic IBTC Holdings, Flour Mills Of Nigeria, Ecobank Transnational Incorporated (ETI). Analysts at Afrinvest Limited said that “We do not expect to see a sustained bullish run although investors have continued to seek bargain hunting opportunities.” Market breadth closed positive, with 25 gainers versus eight losers. ETI and Ikeja Hotel recorded the highest price gain of 10 per cent each, to close at N4.40 and 99 kobo, respectively, while Wema Bank followed with a gain 9.80 per cent to close at 56 kobo, per share. Lafarge Africa went up by 9.77 per cent to close at N11.80, while Dangote Sugar Refinery appreciated by 9.55 per cent  to close at N9.75,  per share.

The upturn was impacted by gains recorded in medium and large capitalised stocks, amongst which are; Nestle Nigeria, Seplat Petroleum Development Company (Seplat), Stanbic IBTC Holdings, Dangote Sugar Refinery and Lafarge Africa. Analysts argued that high dividend yields continue to attract buying interests, while more audited corporate earnings hit the market going forward. This is despite the likely continuation of the selloffs, with investors buying to increase their positions in undervalued stocks ahead of dividend declaration. The chief research officer of Investdata Consulting Limited,  Ambrose Omordion said: ” Investors and traders are positioning in anticipation of the 2019 full-year earnings reports, amidst the changing sentiments in the hope of improved liquidity and positive economic indices which may reverse the current trend. “We see investors focusing on the upcoming full-year earnings season, targeting companies with strong potential to grow their dividend on the strength of their earnings capacity.” Codros Capital Limited said: “Despite the market closing positive this week, risks remain on the horizon, given the rising cases of COVID-19 in Nigeria. “More so, our base case is for the FGN to extend the presently instituted lockdown in Lagos, Abuja, and Ogun, by another one week. Thus, we advise investors to trade cautiously, taking positions in fundamentally justified stocks.” Further analysis of lastweek’s trading showed that the market opened for four trading days as  the Federal Government declared Friday 10th April 2020 as public holiday to mark Good Friday celebration.
