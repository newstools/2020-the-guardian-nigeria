Budding Afro-fusion singer and songwriter, Buju has released the anticipated audio and visuals of ‘L’enu’ remix featuring African Giant, Burna Boy. The Afro-house indebted tune, which was produced by Steph, gets an appropriate flamboyant music video that shows both Afro-fusion pioneer, Burna and his “offspring”, Buju displaying their vocal dexterity and strength. ‘L’enu’ remix is the latest release of outstanding singles Buju has given official visuals, following “Spiritual”. The 22-year-old who is now signed to Spaceship Records shows off his musical strengths in this new visual. The TG Omori-directed visuals see Buju in school, where he had a good time getting everyone to groove to the ‘L’enu’ vibe. Burna Boy shows up after school to pick him up in his Rolls Royce for a video shoot. One word for this video? Cruise! Watch L’enu remix below:
