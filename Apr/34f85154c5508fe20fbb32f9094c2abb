Chris Brown and Young Thug are working on a brand new collaborative mixtape and it’s supposedly “coming soon”, and both fan bases are already looking forward to it. More often than not, artists have jumped the gun and announced that they are working with another star on a collaborative project but only a few follow through. One thing or the other tends to prevent the actual release of the said mixtape. Kanye West and Jay-Z have done it. So have 21 Savage and Offset. Drake and Future’s What A Time To Be Alive cannot be forgotten either. This leaves us wondering if the same will occur. However, it would appear as though Chris Brown and Young Thug have been working closely to see what suits their individual and collective expectations. Announcing on his Instagram Story that his next full-length release would be a collaborative mixtape with Young Thug, Chris Brown shocked the world several hours ago. “ME AND THUGGA THUGGA @thuggerthugger1 Got a mixtape coming soon,” Breezy wrote. <img class="alignnone wp-image-1139094 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/chris-brown-e1586255330724.png" alt="" width="1000" height="1779" /> Both Chris Brown and Young Thug are well versed in the art of the collaborative project. In 2017, Young Thug released Young Martha, a four-track EP with Carnage. It wasn’t long before the rhymer came through with another joint effort because a month later, Thug dropped Super Slimey with Future. Brown released his only joint LP,  Fan of a Fan: The Album, with Tyga in 2015. If this mixtape is released as planned, this will be the first project both have released since their 2019 albums, So Much Fun and Indigo, respectively.
