There was an increase in the subscription after lockdown orders were issued across the world due to the coronavirus pandemic with the firm raking in £576 million (₦243,702,294,796.80) from January to the end of March. The California-based firm more than doubled the quarterly growth it predicted in January before the COVID-19 pandemic started to shut down many major economies. Of Importance is the documentary Tiger King, which has become something of a social media phenomenon, has been watched by 64 million households since its release, the streaming giant revealed today. The series became one of the most talked-about shows of recent times following its arrival on Netflix in March, thanks to a combination of its wild story and captive audience due to the Covid-19 outbreak according to The Daily Mail. Other series which have been very important include Love is blind, Money Heist. Money Heist is however still expected to rake in more views and money that The Tiger King as the number of viewers keeps increasing. Over the past year, Netflix’s growth in the U.S. and Canada had slowed significantly. The pandemic seems to have reversed that trend for the moment. Netflix added 2.3 million subscribers in the U.S. and Canada in the first quarter, up from 1.9 million at the same time last year. While the virus is crippling some businesses, some like Netflix are thriving.
