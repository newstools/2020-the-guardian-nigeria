As COVID-19 continues to wreak havoc on economic activities across the globe, the Nigerian equities market recorded another bearish outing at the end of last week"s transactions. Specifically, the All-Share index and market capitalisation plummeting by 3.51 per cent to close the week at 21,094.62 and N10.994 trillion respectively. All other indices finished lower with the exception of NSE Oil/Gas which appreciated by 2.33 per cent while NSE ASeM Index closed flat. The pandemic induced bear run has scared away fearful and novice investors from the market, as they sold off their positions at a loss, due to low confidence and weak economic fundamentals. Moreso, the ongoing remote trading due to lockdown aimed at stemming the spread of the virus has limited participation. Many stockbroking firms and their clients, especially those that have not perfected the act of remote trading, are struggling to execute trades from remote platforms, due to either inefficiency of their platforms, or a failure to give real online trading education to their clients before now. Reacting on market performance, the chief operating officer of Investdata Consulting Limited said with more companies notifying the exchange and investing public of its closed period 2020 first-quarter earnings report,  the high dividend yields would continue to attract buying interests. "This is despite the likely continuation of the selloffs, with investors buying to increase their positions in undervalued stocks ahead of dividend declaration. He added that the current undervalue state of the market offers investors opportunities to position for the short, medium and long-term. "This why investors should target fundamentally sound, and dividend-paying stocks for possible capital appreciation in the New Year." Codros Capital Limited said: "Our view, the trend witnessed this week is likely to persist, as weakened market sentiments are expected to pressure market returns. Nonetheless, we advise investors to take a position in fundamentally justified stocks."
