• Say African firms lack capacity to mitigate COVID-19 Africa Union Development Agency (AUDA-NEPAD), and Ecobank Group have disclosed plans to collaborate in establishing a continental framework to support African Micro and Small-Medium Enterprises (MSMEs).
 
According to them, MSMEs, which form a large part of individual economies in Africa, have little or no absorption capacity to cushion the effect of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic that is ravaging countries and economies across the world.
 
The organisations said the collaboration was necessary, as it is geared towards a continental initiative to support African MSMEs as they face the economic and social challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.  “As a long time partner of AUDA-NEPAD, we welcome the opportunity to work with the Agency to co-lead this continental platform that will empower MSMEs with knowledge, resources, mentoring, technical expertise and financial support to ensure the sustainability of their businesses during and post COVID-19. “The objective of the continental platform is indeed aligned with the Ecobank vision of contributing to the economic and social development of Africa, our home,” Ayeyemi said.
