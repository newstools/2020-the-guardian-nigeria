 Minister of Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management, Sadiya Farouq  The Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Sadiya Umar-Farouk, said yesterday in Yola during the handing over of 1,800 bags of 50kg rice to the Adamawa State government that the allegation was an embarrassment to the government. Represented by the Director, Humanitarian Services in the ministry, Mr. Ali Alhaji, the minister stated that the 50 trailers of rice were not from the Federal Government, pointing out that only the author of the statement knew the source of the rice. “Today, we are fulfilling our promise to the Adamawa State government by handing over 1,800 bags of 50kg rice – that is three trailers of 600 bags each – for distribution to the vulnerable people of the state in the fight against COVID-19,” he stated. He said that Federal Government was doing everything within its powers to ensure that vulnerable Nigerians were protected against the deadly virus and that state governments should assist in ensuring that the palliatives got to the people they were meant for. Speaking at the ceremony, the deputy governor, Seth Crowther, expressed joy over the donation and assured the minister that the governor would be fair and transparent in the distribution of the palliatives. He expressed disappointment over some statements credited to some top politicians in the state to dent the image of government. The deputy governor warned that the state government would no longer tolerate inciting statements or trying to score political points with issues that affect the lives of the people.
