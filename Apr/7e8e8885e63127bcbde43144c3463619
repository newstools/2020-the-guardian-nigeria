Sarz the producer has taken to his twitter page to show his outrage over a joke M.I made in an Instagram Live show with Blaqbonez. The producer accused M.I of stooping so low by discussing an event that did not happen on an Instagram Live chat with Blaqbonez. M.I Abaga on an Instagram Live chat with Blaqbonez said Sarz had once ejaculated on himself while he was in a club. The club outing according to M.I was the first for Sarz and he happened to be the one to have taken him there. In his words; I took him out one day we went to Rehab, a club around Zenith bank, Ikoyi. He was so happy, he had girls all around him for the first time. I was like, dawg, be calm mehn, you’re Sarz, you produced all these hits. He was shaking. When it was time to leave, I was like Sarz Let’s go. He was like sitting down, apparently, he had ejaculated on himself. This did not go down well with Sarz as he has in a series of tweets explained he had asked M.I to take back what he said without any response from the rapper.   However, Blaqbonez who hosted the live show cleared the air. He explained it was all jokes in a recent tweet. He mentioned that Sarz also laughed at it in the comment session during the live show.  M.I is yet to say anything about the whole issue.
