With absolute faith in the risen Christ, Christians and indeed, Imo people will overcome the Coronavirus pandemic, says Governor Hope Uzodinma. In an Easter message to Imo people, he assured that with strict adherence to safety measures, the state would overcome COVID-19 as the world commemorates the resurrection of Jesus Christ. His Chief Press Secretary/Media Adviser, Oguwike Nwachuku, said the governor also urged Imo people to bear the hardships induced by the need to prevent COVID-19 with the same uncommon patience and perseverance that Christ bore his passion. “Christ’s resurrection is a sign of assurance that after the coronavirus pandemic comes the joy of triumph,” he noted. Uzodimma urged the people to use the Easter celebration to pray fervently to God for an end to the pandemic. He assured the people that he was mindful of the hardship the measures his administration put in place to prevent and control the virus, but insisted that they were inevitable sacrifices that must be made to stay alive and healthy. The governor then called on all true lovers of the state to jettison partisan politics and join hands in the fight against COVID-19 to save lives.
 
He promised to deliver food items to every community in the state to make Easter merrier for the people as part of government’s efforts to alleviate their hardship. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
