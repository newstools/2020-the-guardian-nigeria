• Youths mount hand-washing points on streets, junctions
• Sensitise residents on personal hygiene, safety measures Barely 24 hours after Ondo State government directed the closure of all markets in the state, Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu has ordered the fumigation of all markets and motor parks across the state to curtail the spread of COVID-19. Akeredolu, while speaking in Akure yesterday, said that the committee on sanitation and traffic rules would carry out the exercise immediately.
He disclosed that the state government had purchased motorised water pumps, 50 drums of ethanol and chlorine for the exercise. Chairman of the committee, who is also the state Commissioner for Water Resources, Mrs. Yetunde Adeyanju, said that the exercise would commence immediately. She said that over 100 ad-hoc staff would be recruited by the committee across the three senatorial districts of the state. Meanwhile, a youth group, the Alabata Central Youth Progressive Forum, Egbeda, Lagos, has mounted hand-washing points all over the nine streets and junctions making up their community to support government’s effort in combating COVID-19 in the country. Residents and passersby were sensitised on the importance of regularly hand-washing and also encouraged to wash and sanitise their hands at all the points to prevent contacting the virus. The former President and member, Board of Trustees, Folarin Kehinde, who spoke on the initiative, said it was germane to the youths in the community to secure the residents from the COVID-19 pandemic. He said the youths had to task themselves rather than waiting for the government.He said: “The measure is an initiative of the youths in the community. We did it for the benefit of the community, our children, spouses, parents and elderly who are prone to the harmful effects of the virus, as well as those who do not reside in the community but are passersby. “Just like a case was found in Mushin part of Lagos, we want to ensure that no case is found in this community. As far as this community is concerned, for now, there is no case of Coronavirus. We pray God will protect us from having such case in our community as we do our own part by ensuring a hygienic environment.” Also, a member, Board of Trustees of the youth forum, Azeez Moshood Abiola, said: “We thought about creating hand-washing points, making it fun and a regular habit. It makes it easy for people to wash and sanitise their hands, especially when these points are all over the streets and junctions in the community. “What we did was to get the buckets and fix the taps. We bought soaps, disinfectants and other cleaning agents, mixed them in the water so people can actually use it to wash their hands, and after washing, they use the sanitiser to sanitise their hands.” In the same vein, former Vice President, Sanni Ganiu, said sensitisation and education on the importance of regular hand-washing and hygiene was being done regularly in each house and street in the community to ensure everyone is enlightened and stay safe.
