On Monday, March 23, the Bauchi State Governor, Bala Mohammed went into self-isolation after he reportedly had contact with the son of former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, who was earlier tested positive to the disease.

But the love, affection and prayers shown to me by the people of Bauchi State really kept me going. I cannot hide my health status, but if by doing so I have offended anyone, I apologise for that. It was really a trying time for me. Glory to God that I was able to pass the test. “The situation was made worse with the kidnap of my elder brother but we thank God for his release. I have learnt a great lesson during this period and it has further strengthened me and souring me to do more for the people of Bauchi State.” Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde

He came to me and said, look, I am going to send to you this black seed oil, it boosts immunity,” said. “So I mix it with honey and take one teaspoon in the morning and one in the evening.
