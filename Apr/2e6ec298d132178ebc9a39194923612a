File photo of two men dueling with machete | NPR Two cattle traders have fought to the death after slashing each other over a woman. The men who are both married are reported to have fought at Oljorai in Gilgil Sub-county of Kenya. Viewers were left shocked as they attacked each other with machetes. One had his neck completely severed and died on the spot; the other died after arriving at a nearby health centre. Speaking about the incident, Gilgil Sub-county Commissioner Ndambuki Mutheki said police are investigating the matter. He noted that the woman in question was being sought. A witness identified as Abel Kiprokon disclosed that the two men had been cohabiting with the same woman, a mother of three, for the last two years without knowing. Both men, who are married, did not know each other until Wednesday morning when one of them found the other having breakfast in the woman’s house. “The two went after each other using machetes,” Kiprokon said. This is coming after an earlier report of a butcher who escaped death for using free meat and credit facilities to lure his female clients into bed. He ran out of luck when he fell into a trap set by a husband of one of the women he has been fooling around with. The unidentified husband upon receiving a tip from a neighbor that the 32-year-old butcher popularly known by his nickname Akwai Teta, was with his wife returned unannounced. The husband found his wife and Teta in a compromising situation and went after the butcher using a nyahunyo (rubber whip). The butcher narrowly escaped as the husband tried to reach for a more lethal weapon in the house. The offended husband has, however, vowed to institute a lawsuit to ensure Akwai Teta is kicked out of the dusty township for fooling around with people’s wives.
