Tik Tok and Instagram live come first place as we are daily bombarded with social media challenges and shows such as Verzuz Instagram live battles and Tory Lanez‘s Quarantine Radio. However, New York-based rapper, DMX has taken a different approach. DMX on Friday, April 24, hosted a virtual bible study session on Instagram Live. During the live-streamed event, the “X Gon’ Give It to Ya” rapper read Bible passages and emphasized the importance of certain lines. “God put it on my heart to speak,” DMX said to his fans. “This is new to me. This is not what I do. I ain’t with showing everybody what I’m doing at every minute. That’s just not me. That’s not how I get down. You see me when you see me. It is what it is. That’s how I get down. I ain’t gon’ change. I love who I am. I’m God’s child. We all are.”  Fans praised the rapper for sharing words of encouragement during the coronavirus pandemic.   DMX confirmed last month that he was working on a new album during an episode of Tory Lanez’s Quarantine Radio Instagram Live show. Born Earl Simmons, DMX began rapping in the early 1990s and released his debut album, It’s Dark and Hell Is Hot in 1998 to both critical acclaim and commercial success, selling 251,000 copies within its first week of release. He released his best-selling album, … And Then There Was X in 1999, which included the hit single “Party Up (Up in Here)”. Since his debut, DMX has released seven studio albums. He has been featured in films such as Belly, Romeo Must Die, Exit Wounds, Cradle 2 the Grave and Last Hour. Read More
