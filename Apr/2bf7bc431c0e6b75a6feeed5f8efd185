Sydney Talker | Nigeria Tunes Earlier, we reported that Nigerian Instagram comedian Sydney Talker has shared the result of his coronavirus test. However, the entertainer who tested negative to the novel virus is facing a backlash as he has been accused of playing a prank on the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). Recall that a few days ago, Talker called out the NCDC for failing to test hi despite showing ‘symptoms for coronavirus.’ In a tweet, the NCDC claimed they reached out but were informed that he was fine and a viral video of his was just a prank. Sydney refuted this claim saying the NCDC did not reach out to him and he just wants to be tested because his symptoms are getting worse. Talker upon getting his test results back went mute and it took urging for him to share on Twitter that his test result came out negative. When he shared, he captioned it: “My Test Results just got in from Lagos State Ministry of Health and thankfully it is NEGATIVE. To those who felt this was a PRANK or CLOUT CHASING, I have just one question ” Why would I chase clout at the expense of my life ? ” To everyone who prayed for me in my weakest moment and for quick recovery,I pray that on the day you are in distress may you also find help and recieve prayers IJN Amen I love you all & I promise I will be back and better soonest.” Many are of the opinion that the comedian tricked health workers into testing him and should apologise rather than make excuses. With the hashtag #SydneyNaFraud being used to criticise him, many have called for his arrest because his test result shows that he was tested before March 27 when he alleged that he was yet to be tested, Check out reactions to his test result below:          Sydney came into limelight in 2016 when he released “The Poor Power Supply” comedy skit.
