The statement, signed by Mr. Felix Aganbi, a business mogul, said the late Bible translator, gifted interpreter and scholar, had a strong influence in Itsekiri literature. “Deacon Stephen Ejueyitsi Aganbi was a legal guru, a highly reputed politician of the Second Republic in Nigeria and the Olare-Aja of Koko (community head).” The statement praised Deacon Aganbi for putting his learning to the service of the church and using the Bible to nourish the faith and life of believers. “He served as a spiritual guide to many.” It also praised the accomplished translator for his well-known vision and linguistics competence in the languages of the Niger Delta region.
