Panama Police The lockdown in many countries necessitated by the coronavirus pandemic has many at their wits’ end. However, ingenious police officers in Panama have come up with an ingenious way to help reduce the people’s frustrations and boredom. Police officers in Panama are doing more than just enforcing the lockdown order in the country, they are entertaining the citizens with songs and dances. According to a senior police officer in the country, Felipe Cruz, they are entertaining the citizens so as to bring hope to them. He said: “There are certain sanitary rules that we have to follow, and they are in their apartment, they don’t have much space and we try to bring them some happiness, joy, hope, faith and will so that they never feel lessened.“ This in itself is a welcomed move because as the coronavirus outbreak continues to ravage the world, the citizens have something else to put their mind on. One of the residents who was entertained by the Police officers said it was a nice initiative and it would be more okay if they do it every Sunday: “Very good, very good initiative by the national police to get involved with the people, with the people who are at home, where they need to be, and I think they should do it every Sunday.” Watch a video of the police officers entertainer citizens below:
