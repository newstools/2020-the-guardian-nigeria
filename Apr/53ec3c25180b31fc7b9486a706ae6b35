Abubakar Malami, AGF The pandemic now referred to as ‘Covid-19’ is a very familiar situation and very little will be gained in either profiling or analyzing it. Perhaps, it would be sufficient to acknowledge the havoc it has wrought worldwide. Nonetheless, contrary to expectations elsewhere, COVID-19 has so far not been as deleterious as it has been in other climes.    
   
Again, it is not our intention to foray into any speculation as to why we have been so lucky in this country in that confirmed COVID-19 cases, at the time of writing, is under 500. However, notwithstanding this minimal nature of the impact of the dreaded disease on our country (in terms of casualties), acute measures have been established by the Federal and State Governments to prevent the spread of the disease. 
   
The overwhelming effects of these measures have been felt nationwide to the extent that the freedom of movement enshrined in the constitution has been severely curtailed. Thus, while the Federal Government curtailed movement in Lagos and Ogun States, as well as the Federal Capital Territory, several state governors have closed their state boundaries to prevent ingress and egress, in and out of their respective states. It is in the public domain that several legal juggernauts and heavyweights have brought their legal wizadry to bear on an examination of the legal and constitutional implications of asking able bodied men and women to sit at home – ostensibly in their own interest.
