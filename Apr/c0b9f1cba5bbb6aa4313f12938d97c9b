Oyo State Government had imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew (7.00 P.M. to 6:00 A.M.), which commenced on Sunday night of March 29,2020, and ordered that no gatherings of more than 10 people should hold in the state. The government also implored the residents to observe social distancing. Though there has been strict compliance with the curfew, the issue of social distancing is far from being complied with. Across various markets such as Bodija, Oje and others, sellers and buyers were seen clustering not minding the prevalence of the pandemic. Food sellers, motorcyclists and commercial drivers, who spoke to The Guardian, lamented the state of the economy, urging the State Government to come up with measures to alleviate their challenges. But the Oyo State Governor has assured residents that his administration is working out measures and palliatives to cushion the effects of the pandemic. The Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Taiwo Adisa, who disclosed this to The Guardian, said the government had received some donations and food items, adding that they would ensure that those palliatives got to the intended beneficiaries. “I don’t think markets in Ibadan work at night; only those who work at night will be worried about the curfew. I don’t think there is an issue about the curfew; those on essential services are not affected by the curfew. Which of the company working in the night that will be affected by the curfew in Ibadan? Nobody can really feel the impact of the curfew.” “The Governor has said he is going to put in palliative measures for the people of the State. But he has to work out a process by which that palliative measure will get to the real people that need it, so that middlemen will not corner it. So, our two ministries at the inter-ministerial level are working on those measures and palliatives right now.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
