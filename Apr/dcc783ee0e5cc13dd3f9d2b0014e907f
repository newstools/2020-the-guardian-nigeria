For Ekaniyere Augustina Enabor, a fashion designer in Victoria Garden City, Lagos Island,  this lockdown period is one that she will never forget in a hurry. She told The Guardian that it has been a trying moment for her. Reflecting on her losses, she said monetary value couldn’t be put on the cost, as they are both emotional and physical She said:  “First, I was supposed to have done my marriage registration at the Federal Marriage Registry in Ikoyi on March 26, but it was cancelled that day.” She said, “you need to see the disappointment on my face that morning. We were at the Registry as early as 6:30am, when we heard that every activity has been stopped. It is very painful to rent your gown and make yourself up and the next thing you hear is that it has been cancelled.” She continued, “the worst part is that my traditional marriage and church wedding that should have held on April 28 and May 2 have been put on hold. A lot of money was spent on printing cards and sundry logistics for the marriage.” Still weeping when she spoke with The Guardian, Ekaniyere said the most painful part is that my father died during this period. He died on April 2. On the day of his death, I could not reach his residence to even see his body or make any plans as to how his remains could be conveyed to the mortuary. We actually wanted to take his body to our hometown in Obedu, Uromi, Edo State,  so that the cost of preserving it in the mortuary will be reduced. But we couldn’t. It was even difficult for us to bring his corpse to the mortuary in Igando. If not for my cousin, who lives close to my dad, his neighbours wanted to go and dump his body in the mortuary without my sister or I seeing the body to confirm whether he was really dead. You can imagine when the person we hired to carry the corpse to Edo State said the least amount he was going to collect was N150,000. I was really mad” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
