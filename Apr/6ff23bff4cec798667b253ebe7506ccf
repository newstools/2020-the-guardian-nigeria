The Nigeria Immigration Service on Thursday extended the existing suspension passports processing in its offices across the country. A spokesman for the immigration Sunday James in a statement said the extension was in compliance with the government’s restriction of movement over the spread of coronavirus. “The Comptroller General of Immigration Service, Muhammad Babandede MFR, has accordingly directed for the extension of the temporary suspension of processing of passport and Migrant e-Registration from the 23rd April – 23rd May 2020 in pursuance of the government’s directives on Restrictions on International Flight and closure of land borders,” James said. James said the one-month extension was “to give the situation the deserved attention and approach, considering the successes achieved and the need to drastically reduce the spread.” The service in late March suspended the migrants e-registration and issuance of passport as part of measures to curb the spread of coronavirus in the country. During the one month extension of the current suspension, James said the NIS will “process all pending passport cases and the public will be duly informed when they are ready for collection at the expiration of the restriction order. “The Service regrets any inconvenience caused the general public within this period while assuring Nigerians of our continued service.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
