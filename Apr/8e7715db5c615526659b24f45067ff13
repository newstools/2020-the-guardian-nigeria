A former District Head of Jagindi Tasha, Mr. Danaladi Barde, and his brother, simply identified as Moses, were killed on Monday night in an attack on Jagindi, Jema’a local government area of Kaduna State. It was gathered that the attackers, who stormed the village on motorbikes, left some other people critically injured. The attackers also stormed the compound of the former Village Head and killed him and his brother, while the deceased were trying to settle a family dispute. Jema’a local council chairman, Mr. Peter Danjuma Averik, who confirmed the development, said security operatives have since been mobilized to contain the situation. He, however, appealed to citizens to remain calm, as investigations were ongoing to track the perpetrators of the attack. Meanwhile, two herdsmen have been reportedly killed in Yagba area of Kogi State in what is believed to be a reprisal attack. The herders’ bodies were found in a bush between Imela and Ogbom communities in Yagba East Local Government Area on Sunday. The killing was sequel to the machete attack on a resident of Ogbom on Saturday night by suspected Fulani herdsmen.​ The victim, simply identified as Lekan, was said to have been severely hit by a machete, left in the pool of his own blood and robbed of his cash while transiting between Ogbom and Imela. Our reporter was at the intensive care unit of ECWA Hospital, Egbe, Yagba West Local Council, where the victim is currently receiving medical attention.​ His skull was ripped open as a result of the repeated machete attacks by the herdsmen, thereby standing little chances of survival, a family source in the hospital told our reporter. The bone of contention of the latest incident of herders/residents clashes in the Ogga-Ogbom axis of Yagba area is still under investigation at the time of this report. However, the development is the source of fresh tension in the adjoining Ogga community in neighbouring Yagba West Local Council, where similar incident last year led to spontaneous arrests. The news of the Sunday incident was brought to the notice of SSA Security to the Governor in charge of Yagba West Council, Tade Oshaloto, who immediately mobilized security agents to the border town to forestall a spillover of the crisis to Ogga. Oshaloto and his counterpart, the SSA on Security in charge of Yagba East Local Council, Abdulwakil Olorunjuwon, combined to lead the Joint Military Task Force from the two councils to the scene of the incident and to the palace of the Ologbom of Ogbom, Oba Michael Aiyenigba. Meanwhile, four residents have been arrested in connection with the killings of the herdsmen. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
