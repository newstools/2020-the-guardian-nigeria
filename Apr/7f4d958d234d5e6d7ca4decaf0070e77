Ekiti State Governor Kayode Fayemi on Thursday appointed Femi Adeoye as coronavirus response ambassador in the state. “Today, I appointed Mr. Adeoye, father of the young man who sneaked into Ekiti state, as a COVID-19 Response Ambassador in Ekiti State,” Fayemi tweeted. “I am proud of Mr Adeoye as a principled Ekiti man and I salute his courage in helping us keep Ekiti safe.” Adeoye on Tuesday prevented his son who sneaked into Ekiti from Lagos State during the lockdown from entering his house over the fear of contracting and spreading coronavirus. In a viral video, Adeoye handed over his son to security operatives attached to Fajuyi Pavilion, the base for Ekiti State Enforcement Taskforce, for proceeding on the journey despite his advice restraining him not to. He disclosed that he had told security operatives that his son was journeying from Lagos and determined not to allow him to stay in the house except he goes into isolation elsewhere. Adeoye urged the authorities to keep his son under supervision until he is certified coronavirus-free. After Adeoye’s appointment, Fayemi said the senior citizen will serve as a member of the state’s task force help the state government spread the message of safety and preventive measures from contracting coronavirus.
