The pandemic has claimed the lives of more than 57,000 people in the US, which leads the world in the number of confirmed infections with 1,002,498, according to the Baltimore-based school’s latest count. The latest numbers come as the COVID-19 epidemic appears to be easing in hotspots like New York while other states move to reopen their economies — even though case and death rates continue to rise in some places. New York remains the hardest hit US state with 22, 668 deaths — and over 17,500 in New York City alone. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said 335 people had died in the state over the previous 24-hour period, a decline but still staggering. “This number is basically reducing but not at a tremendous rate and the only thing tremendous is the number of New Yorkers who still pass away,” he said.
