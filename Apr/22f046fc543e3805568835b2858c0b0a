As per a report by TMZ, on Sunday, April 5th, the “A Fall From Grace” producer gave each of the 42 workers at the restaurant a $500 (₦183,500). It was also reported that the restaurant is a favourite of Perry. Tyler Perry whose birth name is Emmitt Perry Jr. is known for his acts of generosity. Since 2008, Tyler Perry has donated funds to bring clean water to an estimated 65,079 people across four countries, including nine communities in Ethiopia, four in Haiti, one in India, and six provinces in Cambodia. In 2009, Perry donated $1 million to NAACP, America’s oldest and largest civil rights organization. He also purchased several lithographs commissioned by the organization to help fund it. Perry said of his donation, “I feel so honoured and blessed to be in a position where I can give to the NAACP.” After the 2010 earthquake devastated Haiti, Perry jumped into action. He pledged $250,000 to help the island recover, then raised his own total and promised an additional $750,000 to make it a cool million. In early December 2018, the filmmaker selected two Walmart stores in the Atlanta area and paid the remaining balance of everything that happened to be on layaway, totalling over $400,000.
