The play-off semi-finals and finals that are supposed to decide the last four qualifying berths for the next European Championship were initially postponed at the end of March and pencilled in provisionally for June. That was “subject to a review of the situation” amid uncertainty over how the pandemic will develop and whether many European countries currently in lockdown will be able to return to some kind of normality. However, UEFA has also stated a determination to finish all domestic and club competitions by June 30. While that currently looks ambitious at the very least, clearing the international fixtures from the same month does buy some more time as they aim to complete the Champions League and Europa League competitions as well as domestic leagues. Carrying the season on beyond that date runs the risk of clubs losing their out-of-contract players before matches have been completed unless a solution can be found. The impact of the pandemic on Europe has already forced UEFA to put Euro 2020 back 12 months. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
