The club had already announced last week that they had asked labour authorities to slash player pay through a partial unemployment scheme. Atletico added that an agreement with the first team will enable the club to supplement the salaries of the 430 staff put on partial unemployment. “The first team will contribute half of the necessary amount and the members of the club’s Management Committee, made up of the CEO and the directors of the different areas, the other half,” the statement said. On Monday, Lionel Messi announced that his Barca teammates had agreed to the same pay cut and that they would also supplement the salaries of the club’s employees.
