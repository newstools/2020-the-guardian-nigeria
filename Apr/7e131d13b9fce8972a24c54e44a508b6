A clip of the stunt was posted on Sunday (April 5) where the fan was seen filling his glass with pee from the toilet instead of producing it on the spot. Lil Yachty excited by what was happening said, “I got 500 for that. Get a big scoop of that bitch.” Yachty and his two friends watch astounded as the fan raises the cup to his lips, before taking a big swig then stopping. Lil Boat eggs him on, saying, “Keep going, keep going, keep going. Hit it. You got it, keep going.” After several breaks between gulps, the cash-hungry fan manages to swallow the remaining contents and Yachty pays him. Throughout the coronavirus quarantine, Yachty has been getting fans to perform ridiculous Instagram Live stunts for a $200 CashApp donation. So far, he has paid a fan to shave off his eyebrows and gotten others to eat deodorant and cat food. He also attempted to sell designer toilet paper for $500 a pack as the coronavirus pandemic started to sweep the globe. Lil Yachty, is an American rapper, singer and songwriter. Yachty first gained recognition in August 2015 for his singles “One Night” and “Minnesota” from his debut EP Summer Songs. He released his debut mixtape Lil Boat in March 2016.
