Kwam 1, Olori Ajoke and Alaafin of Oyo In the early hours of today, social media was filled with rumours and allegations that veteran Nigerian singer Wasiu Ayinde Marshal also known as K1 De Ultimate was romantically involved with Olori Ajoke, one of the wives of the Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi III. The Fuji musician in a statement released by his media adviser Kunle Rasheed has denied the allegations. According to the statement released by Rasheed, the respected musician cannot bring disrepute to the culture and tradition of Yorubaland by his alleged actions. The statement reads: “Let me categorically state that the allegation is false concocted from the pit of hell by those whose aim is to drag to the mud, the name of K1 De Ultimate and ultimately that of the most revered kingdom in Yoruba land. These agents of Lucifer have continued in their warped delusions to see K1 go to the ground just for being conferred with the title of Mayegun of Yoruba land.” Rasheed in the statement also made it known that legal action could be taken against the author of the fake news. He said: “Let me remind the rumour mongers that Nigeria has adequate laws to bring anyone who has embarked on character assassination of the innocent to book. The fans and the general public should rest assured that we will legally seek redress for this allegation.” Alaafin of Oyo recently installed Wasiu Ayinde (Kwam 1) as the Mayegun of Yoruba land some months ago in Oyo state. Kwam 1 as he is fondly called popularized a brand of the fuji genre based on the work of the fuji creator Ayinde Barrister known as Talazo fuji that appeals to all age groups, irrespective of tribe and background. He released his first album titled Iba with the special track ‘Abode Mecca’ in 1980, and thereafter, his most successful album Talazo ’84 in 1984. He has won many titles and several music awards.
