The offices and main buildings in Gombe district are concerned. Once everything has been cleaned in Gombe, other areas will be targeted,” it said. On Thursday, Kinshasa Governor Gentiny  Ngobila announced that Gombe, one of the capital’s 26 districts, would be “placed in quarantine” from April 6-20. The district “is considered to be the epicentre of the epidemic in the city,” he said. According to the Democratic Republic of Congo’s official figures, the sprawling country has recorded 161 cases of coronavirus, 18 of them fatal. Almost all have occurred in the capital, with a handful of other cases in the volatile east. During the partial lockdown, anti-coronavirus teams in Kinshasa will “look for sick people but also investigate risk contacts and asymptomatic cases” for testing and treatment, the authorities said. People who go to work in Gombe — drivers, gardeners and so on — will be tested in their districts of residence and will be quarantined if they have the virus.
