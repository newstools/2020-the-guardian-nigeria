Tekashi 6ix9ine’s legal team sent a letter to Judge Paul Engelmayer for permission to film music videos in his backyard. “I am writing today only to request the Court’s approval to permit Mr Hernandez to spend up to two hours in his backyard, once a week, for employment purposes only. He is looking to record music videos in his backyard. Probation is aware and has no objection to this request.” Tekashi is currently serving the remainder of his 24-month sentence at home. He was given an early prison release on Thursday, April 2 after being identified as being at high risk of contracting coronavirus due to being diagnosed with bronchitis and sinusitis last year. In 2018, he was arrested on racketeering, weapons, and drugs charges. He pled guilty to nine charges including conspiracy to murder and armed robbery in February 2019 and was given a 2-year prison sentence in December 2019 after testifying against fellow members of the Nine Trey Gangsters. While he was in prison, he signed a record deal worth more than $10 million with his former label, 10K Projects. 6ix9ine  released his debut album “Dummy Boy” in 2018. The album debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200, despite receiving negative reviews from critics. Backed by the new deal, Tekashi 6ix9ine is currently recording two albums: one English and one Spanish. He has already been granted permission to record music out of his home studio, but he would require a written note from the judge to film music videos in his backyard.
