The leading entertainment and media company’s contribution in the fight against COVID-19 includes cash support of ₦200m and ₦50m to the Federal and Lagos State Governments respectively, the donation of 10,000 certified test kits to the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, public service announcement (PSA) of prevention tips in English, Pidgin, Ibo, Yoruba and Hausa languages, as well as approved inventory worth over ₦550m highlighting the NCDC’s COVID-19 helplines and PSAs on more than 10 channels across DStv and GOtv. The company will also cover the remuneration for engaged creative industry professionals whose productions have been disrupted, with a committed sum of up to ₦400m. As seen in the most hard-hit countries, the availability of test kits and supplies for medical personnel have been some of the biggest challenges in fighting the pandemic. The outbreak has also had a direct impact on individual businesses and general economic activities. Nigeria’s creative industry has been particularly affected, with on-going productions suspended in response to the government’s advisory on public gatherings and social distancing. MultiChoice Nigeria’s intervention, in line with its values as a responsible corporate organisation and leader in the media and the creative sector, is aimed at supporting the authorities in fighting the pandemic and reducing its attendant impact on Nigeria’s national economy. “We are donating 10,000 certified test kits to support the great work being done by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and the Federal Ministry of Health,” said Chairman, MultiChoice Nigeria, Adewunmi Ogunsanya (SAN). “In addition to these, we are also contributing ₦250 million to the Federal and Lagos State Governments’ efforts in providing adequate healthcare delivery facilities to fight covid-19. We are doing this because we recognise the impact that the covid-19 pandemic has on Nigerians and the economy. “We hope our contributions to NCDC, the federal and state governments, alongside other donations, will go a long way towards effective management of the outbreak.” Additionally, John Ugbe, the CEO of MultiChoice Nigeria added: “We have committed ₦550m worth of inventory to public service announcements in our indigenous languages, in addition to English and Pidgin, to ensure that every Nigerian understands how to prevent covid-19 or call for help through the NCDC helplines.” He added: “Also, the creative industry salary payment of up to ₦400m will offer a much-needed financial reprieve for producers, actors, and technical talent currently contracted to MultiChoice Nigeria, whose livelihoods have been disrupted by the pandemic.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
