This will come into force once it is approved by President Idriss Deby Itno. The change is “aimed at harmonising our laws in line with all the countries of the G5 Sahel Group,” the minister said. Chad’s military is a key part of the 5,000-man G5 force alongside Burkina Faso, Niger, Mali and Mauritania in cooperating with French troops to combat a growing Islamist insurgency.
