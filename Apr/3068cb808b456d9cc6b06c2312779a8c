He has revealed that he has now passed quarantine after testing positive for Covid-19, but says he and his wife Sabrina Dhowre lba are stranded as they’re unable to catch a flight home Last month, the couple entered self-quarantine after contracting coronavirus, but the actor has said they are now both “asymptomatic”. In a Twitter update posted on Tuesday night, he explained: We’re both doing OK, still asymptomatic, and we’ve passed the quarantine period. However, we’re a little bit stuck in limbo. We can’t get a flight back home so we just have to sit still for a little bit. But other than that, we’re OK, and we’re so thankful for that. I think the worst of it has probably passed. It’s weird because I never sit still. I never sit still, and Sabrina never sits still either. I think she’s finding it harder, she’s getting cabin fever, but we’re both good mentally, just trying to stay optimistic. I hope you guys are too, man. Keeping yourselves sane and not getting too worried and too panicked. Take it from me, man. I thought I was definitely going to see the worst of [coronavirus] as an asthmatic, but thankfully I came through, and you can too. And to everyone that’s going through hard times financially right now, man, you know, just bear up. This is going to be a tough time for everyone, but try and keep your head up, basically. Alright? Idris has shared a number of video updates on social media with his followers throughout the Quarantine period. He also shared a song he’d written about the time he and Sabrina had spent in quarantine.
