Taking to Instagram, the 61-year-old pop star, Madonna, paid a gushing tribute to her toyboy lover, Ahlamalik Williams on his birthday as she shared a string of photographs of herself snuggled up to her boyfriend as he passed the quarter of a century mark into his late twenties. The Material Girl singer explained that she is isolating with the younger man amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, and is totally elated to be locked up with her lover. In the post, she wrote: Happy Birthday My Love. I Could not think of a better person to be in Quarantine with! posting the wordings alongside a red heart emoji. Photos shared by the star showed her pressed firmly against his chest and smiling happily as they posed for the camera. Another showed her locking lips with her love, who, at 26, is a little over two years older than Madonna’s eldest daughter, Lourdes Ciccone Leon, who turns 24 in October. Madonna also shared a painting of herself with Ahlamalik among the images in her Instagram post.   Happy Birthday My Love ♥.
