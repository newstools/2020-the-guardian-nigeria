Kanye West was featured on the cover of Forbes last summer, when interviewed about his success with Yeezy, he seemed pleased at first. But he was displeased about the fact that he was not named a billionaire. In a panel interview, Kanye said, I showed them an $890 million receipt and they still didn’t say ‘billionaire’. Kanye West has taken it upon himself to provide documents to the publication, giving them an “authentic numeric look into Kanye, Inc.” to prove the feat. However, the article by Forbes notes that West was left unhappy with their research and findings, stating that he believes his net worth to be around $3.3 billion, rather than the $1.26 billion they have estimated. He texted: It’s not a billion. It’s $3.3 billion since no one at Forbes knows how to count. The news comes after West’s sister-in-law Kylie Jenner, 22, was named by Forbes as the youngest ‘self-made’ billionaire for the second year in a row after selling off 51% of her cosmetics brand. When that annual billionaire’s list appeared earlier this month, the writer of the article, O’Malley Greenburg, claims that West was not happy with his name being absent. According to O’Malley Greenburg, a senior editor at Forbes, Kanye Texted to say: You know what you’re doing. You’re toying with me and I’m not finna lye [sic] down and take it anymore in Jesus name. Greenburg further stated that: At one point, he texted that Forbes was “purposely a part of a group of media” that was trying to suppress his self-made narrative because of his race. That sister-in-law Kylie Jenner did make the list also clearly stuck in his craw. Focusing on the wealth breakdown, Forbes claims that West’s team provided statements that showed the rapper has $17 million in cash, $35 million in stocks, $81 million in “buildings and improvements” and $21 million in land. Forbes also looked into Adidas Yeezy, the fashion collaboration between the rapper and the German sportswear brand, which they claim has a revenue worth of around $1.3 billion, and around $140 million from sales just last year. Forbes estimate that West’s Yeezy cut of the $140 million makes his stake worth about $1.4 billion, however, they noted that it’s a ‘private, highly-illiquid $1.4 billion’ pegging it closer to $1.26 billion. Kanye says his net worth to be around $3.3 billion. He is however now a member of the billionaires club. [ad unit=2
