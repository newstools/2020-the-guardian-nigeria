His recovery from the disease came less than two weeks after he announced that he tested positive for the virus that has killed over 80, 000 people worldwide. But what is new is how the governor quickly boosted his immunity while battling the disease in self-isolation. In an interview with Isaac Brown of Fresh FM in Ibadan, Governor Makinde said he an official in Oyo State gave showed in “local solutions”. He said: My very good friend and brother, Dr Muyideen Olatunji. He is the one in charge of the Primary Healthcare for Oyo State. He came to me and said, look, I am going to send to you this blackseed oil, it boosts immunity. So I mix it with honey and take one teaspoon in the morning and one in the evening. So, there are local solutions to boost immunity. So, our people should not fret. They shouldn’t fret. Just as I have been able to get the virus out of my system, so will it be for majority of our people. Before Governor Makinde’s testimony, Ooni of Ife said he could cure coronavirus infections with local herbs. Although there is no scientific proof that the herbs have or will work against coronavirus, Ooni insisted that “I have used it and also used it for some of the chronic Corona patients with testimonials.”
