Turkey on Wednesday sent health supplies including masks to Italy and Spain, the two European countries worst hit by the novel coronavirus, the defence ministry said. “Health supplies prepared to fight COVID-19 together, and with the hopes of seeing brighter days were sent en route to Spain and Italy” by a military plane, the ministry tweeted in English. An accompanying video clip showed a Turkish military A-400M cargo plane preparing to take off. The defence ministry posted the same message in Turkish, Spanish and Italian. The supplies including masks, overalls and anti-bacterial fluids, produced in the defence ministry’s factories and sewing facilities. Local resources were being sent “on the instructions of President” Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said the ministry statement.
