A statement from her family said she died peacefully on Friday: Having suffered a massive stroke last night and a subsequent bleed on the brain, presenter and journalist Lynn Faulds Wood passed away peacefully at 12 noon today with her husband John Stapleton and son Nick at her bedside. The presenter was best known for hosting the BBC consumer show Watchdog alongside Stapleton from 1985 to 1993. She was diagnosed with stage three bowel cancer in 1991 at the age of 40. She recovered from this and called for better awareness of the illness. She also presented the investigative programme World In Action during the 1990s, before going on to become a consumer champion on GMTV between 2003 and 2009. In 2006 she worked with Dame Esther Rantzen to present BBC consumer rights programme; Old Dogs, New Tricks. Fellow broadcasters and journalists paid tribute to her today saying she was ‘impressive and courageous in her campaigning’. Fellow TV presenter and journalist Dame Esther Rantzen tweeted: I have known Lynn for many years. We made a series together which was huge fun but also very hard-hitting because she was such an impressive and courageous consumer journalist. She fought for the rights of vulnerable people doggedly and determinedly and she is a huge loss to journalism and to her friends and family. We are all devastated at this news. BBC Newsreader Sophie Raworth described Faulds Wood as “the most wonderful, generous, kind friend”, while former Watchdog host and 5 Live’s Nicky Campbell and LBC’s Shelagh Fogarty also paid tribute to the “groundbreaking” broadcaster. TV series Watchdog, which was renowned for holding businesses to account, first began as a strand of current affairs show Nationwide in the 1980s according to The Daily Mail. The show has since gone on to complete more than 1,000 episodes across 41 series, which were hosted by 23 different presenters. The series investigates complaints made by viewers over issues with Britain’s retailers, traders, and other businesses.
