• FG begins daily briefing on pandemic, excludes journalists The Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria (HURIWA) has expressed concern that ambiguities in President Muhammadu Buhari’s national broadcast may have paved the way for armed security operatives to breach the fundamental human rights of Nigerians. Citing chapter 4 of the 1999 Constitution (as amended), it said the Constitution specifically stated that there should be freedom from arbitrary arrests and detention, rights to life, dignity of the human person and other basic freedoms recognised in international human rights laws. “The Federal Government should not abuse the human rights of Nigerians through arbitrary detentions and illegal arrests of citizens for violating the quarantine order. “There is the possibility and indeed it has started happening that armed security forces are already arresting and detaining Nigerians under flimsy excuses and the armed security forces are extorting Nigerians in the guise of granting them bail,” it stressed. In a statement issued by its National Coordinator, Emmanuel Onwubiko in Abuja, the group criticised Buhari’s national broadcast for lack of clarity, adding that the directive to shut down Lagos State, the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) and Ogun State for two weeks without making provisions for how families could buy their daily needs. Meanwhile, President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday approved the constitution of a committee to be headed by Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo to address the Coronavirus pandemic. The Federal Government also began daily briefing on the state of the nation to at 2pm to update Nigerians on happenings in the country. However, the daily media briefing by the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on Coronavirus pandemic in Abuja would remain closed to journalists.
