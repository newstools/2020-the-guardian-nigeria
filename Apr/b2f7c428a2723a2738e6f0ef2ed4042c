The office of South African President, Cyril Ramaphosa, on Monday, said more than 200 Cuban health workers had arrived in the country to help fight against the coronavirus pandemic. It said a total of 217 medics, comprising doctors, scientists and health experts, were to be dispatched across all provinces of South Africa. Ramaphosa asked his Cuban counterpart Miguel Diaz-Canel to intervene, with the African country hit hardest by the new coronavirus. According to the Africa Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, South Africa has over 4,500 confirmed cases of COVID-19. Africa’s second-largest economic power brought in a strict nationwide lockdown a few weeks ago to try to stem the virus’ outbreak, which has potentially devastating implications for the economy. For years Cuba has sent thousands of doctors abroad to help with health crises, such as the Ebola epidemic in West Africa. This year its doctors have already helped out in Italy, the European country hit hardest by the coronavirus. Government employed Cuban doctors and health workers are currently at work in around 60 countries.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
