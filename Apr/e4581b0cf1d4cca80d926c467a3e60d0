United Nation’s arm concerned with regulating global communications, the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) has backed science on the controversies surrounding the deployment of 5G technology. ITU, which said no scientific basis between 5G and COVID-19 pandemic, urged the globe to promote facts and science over despair and division. The body, which said that coronavirus disease is a threat to humanity and the first pandemic in human history where information technology and social media are being used on a massive scale to help cope with and respond to the disease, but noted that if these technologies have helped keep people safe, productive and connected during this unprecedented crisis, they have also spread fear and confusion about COVID-19. According to the body, to tackle this issue and overcome the spread of COVID-19, UN Secretary-General António Guterres has urged us to promote facts and science over despair and division. ITU said as claims linking 5G technology and the spread of COVID-19 are mounting, it stands on the side of science and makes it clear that such claims have no scientific basis whatsoever. The UN body said trusted news and facts about COVID-19 is paramount.ITU Secretary-General Houlin Zhao, said: “now, more than ever, information technology is vital to our economy, health, and safety. And ITU, as the UN specialized agency for information and communication technologies, will continue to leverage these technologies to help defeat COVID-19 and make us safer, stronger, and more connected.” Meanwhile data compiled by Finbold.com has revealed that in the next five years global 5G connections will be 2.7 billion. According to the data, this will be a growth of at least 20 times from this year’s 120 million connections. The report projected that 5G connections is  to keep growing The data projects that by next year, the connections will grow by 180 per cent to stand at 340 million. By 2022, the connections will be 810 million and later grow by 72.8 per cent to hit 1.4 billion in 2023. In the next four years, the connections will stand at 2 billion and later increase by 35 per cent to stand at 2.7 billion by 2025. 5G is the 5th generation mobile network with a new global wireless standard following previous connections of 1G, 2G, 3G, and 4G networks. With 5G, the network is designed to connect virtually everyone and everything including machines, objects, and even devices. According to the report: “However, with the 5G network imminent, there have been concerns about the network’s potential impact on human health. There are still controversies that the network carries a dangerous escalation of traditional cellular technology that comes with higher energy radiation that causes potential damaging effects on human beings.” Globally, companies are moving to establish 5G connections as a way of reaping the full benefits of the technology. Big players in the technology world have filed patents concerning the network with Asia taking the lead. By February 2020, China’s Huawei had 3,147 filings followed by Samsung at 2,795.ZTE is third with 2,561 total patents while South Korea’s LG has 2,300 total patents filed. Elsewhere, Nokia has 2,149 patents while Erickson has 1,494. From North America, Qualcomm has filed 1,293 patents while Intel has 870 filings.
