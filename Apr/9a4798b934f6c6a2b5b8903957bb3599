The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) has warned candidates who sat for this year’s Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) to be wary of fraudsters calling them for the upgrade of scores. The board, in its weekly bulletin on Sunday in Abuja, warned that such calls for the doctoring of their outcomes were a scam.It advised parents and candidates against engaging in such act, threatening sanction. The organisation said: “The Anti-Corruption and Transparency Unit of the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) wishes to advise parents, guardians and candidates in particular that there is nothing called ‘JAMB score upgrade.’“This has never existed and will never be condoned by the board. “Parents/guardians and candidates alike are to note that the so-called score upgrade is simply a scam perpetrated by fraudsters to deceive unsuspecting and gullible candidates, their parents or their guardians as the case may be.” It added: “Therefore, any parent/guardian/ candidate that gets himself/herself involved in such a fraudulent act is doing so at his/her own peril and should be ready to face the full wrath of the law when caught.”Similarly, JAMB directed candidates with challenges or complaints to its ticketing platform.
