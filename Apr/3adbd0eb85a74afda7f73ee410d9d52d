Kiddies Mirror Initiative has empowered teenage boys and young leaders with valuable career awareness, time management and leadership skills. Facilitator of Kiddies Mirror Initiative, Anthony Obi, at the interactive section in Lagos, encouraged the boys to discover the power and potential embedded in them to enhance their productivity. While motivating the boys to acquire knowledge on how to harness the powers that lay within them as special persons for global impact, he noted that the programme was aimed at building a society with great collaborators as well as resonate the magnitude and efficacy of the power available to other persons. On his part, Chief Executive Officer, Foliotech Institute, Olufolahan Olumide, charged Nigerian youths to explore and develop their potential to the fullest for the benefit of future generations. Olumide, who spoke on ‘Making the man the master”, maintained that every boy is expected to become a leader and home builder, whose purpose is divinely connected to solve a problem in the nation or community they were born to serve. While he charged them to live a godly and impactful life, he awarded scholarship to 130 children between the ages of three and 18 years on computer technology, coding, virtual arts and drawing to empower them. According to him, the gesture would help to transform the boys to become hardworking and fulfilled men, who would be measured by the many lives they will impact positively.

He pledged the Force support to continue to protect them and property, even as they shun crime. He encouraged them to pursue their vision and support each other for peaceful communities, city and nation at large.
