The management of the Enugu State University Teaching Hospital (ESUT-Parklane) have resorted to running its clinical services with consultants, House Officers and other medical personnel, following a resumed strike, yesterday, by resident doctors. The Guardian learnt the doctors downed tools without adequate notice, after collecting their April salary, and 25 per cent of their basic salary, as COVID-19 allowance approved for all health workers. The doctors summoned an emergency meeting on receiving their salary and resolved to resume their strike indefinitely, until their full Consolidated Medical Salary Structure (CONMESS) was met. The state government, on Friday, as part of its commitment to contain Coronavirus in the state, paid COVID-19 allowance to doctors and other health workers, as incentive. This was in addition to the payment of April salary of all public servants and the recently approved life insurance package for doctors and other health workers in the state. A statement signed by its President, Chima Edoja and Secretary, Chukwuma Ofonere said that action followed  government’s inability to pay the remaining fraction CONMESS 2009 to its members, as done in other tertiary institutions, which was agreed during their meeting earlier in the month. But, the state government has declared the strike illegal, stressing that the doctors did not serve the mandatory 21-day notice. It added that their action was in contempt of the National Industrial Court, Enugu Order issued last month, which restrained them from continuing with their strike, until the matter was determined.
