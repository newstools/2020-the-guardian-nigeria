Some few days ago, Nollywood actress Halima Abubakar announced the birth of her child with a photo of a baby’s hand holding an adult’s thumb. However, it turned out this photo belongs to an American mom named Ariel. A little digging done on Instagram shows that Ariel posted her photo on March 13 while Halima shared the same photo this April (two days ago, as at the time of reporting). According to screenshots of direct messages between Ariel and Halima, it showed the actress admitted that she only posted the photo to announce her child’s birth. In her defense, she wasn’t referring to Ariel’s baby; she saw the photo on Google and because she liked the nails, she couldn’t help but repost it. Halima then went on to tender an apology stating she will delete the photo while congratulating Ariel on the birth of her child. But, all of these did not go unnoticed as many Nigerians responded differently to the news. See some reactions below:
