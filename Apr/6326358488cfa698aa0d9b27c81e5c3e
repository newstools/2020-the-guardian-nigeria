Lebanese nationals in Nigeria are not contemplating leaving the country for fear of contracting Coronavirus. The pandemic, presently wreaking havoc on human lives and global economic, has compelled the European Union to evacuate its citizens from Nigeria. But the honorary Consul of Lebanon in Kano, Khalil Muselmani insisted Lebanese nationals would remain in Nigeria, regardless of any threat. Muselmani, who spoke yesterday, while delivering donation of food items and medical consumables worth over N100m to Kano Fundraising Committee on COVID-19, said Kano is home to hundreds of Lebanese. Although the Consul disclosed that the decision to leave the country remains personal, he, however, confirmed that hundreds of Lebanese nationals declined evacuation proposal by the United Kingdom, American and Lebanese authorities. He pledged continuous support of Lebanese community to Kano State government in moment of joy and need. Receiving the lorry loads of food items and consumables, Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje applauded the Lebanese community’s intervention, which would further consolidate government’s palliative measures against Coronavirus.
