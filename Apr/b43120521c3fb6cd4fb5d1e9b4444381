He said that the policemen took them to the state’s quarantine centre at Pa Ngele Oruta stadium where returnees were kept and observed. The governor said that when tests were conducted on them, the victim tested positive, his wife’s result was inconclusive while that of the house help turned negative. According to Umahi, the tracing of the police officers who arrested them and the driver who conveyed them from Asaba had begun. “The victim has been taken to the state’s isolation centre at Unity square Abakaliki as I urge the people not to panic,” he said.
