The Lagos State Police Command has warned Lagosians to shun rumours of armed robbery attacks in different parts of the state. Spokesman of the command, Bala Elkana, who was reacting to phone calls on alleged armed robbery activities in Egbeda and Abule Egba, noted that the state was free of robbery activities on Monday as armed security personnel had been despatched to check their activities. One Esther had called The Guardian to report ongoing gunshots by unknown persons at Kola area of Abule Egba. When contacted, Elkana described the report as ‘rumour’. “Lagosians must shun rumour in order to avoid panic across the state. How would any armed robber operate freely with the security architecture we have put in place”, he said. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
