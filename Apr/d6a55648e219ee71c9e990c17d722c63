Transactions on the equities sector of the Stock Exchange (NSE) sustained rising profile yesterday, as more blue-chip stocks joined the league of gainers, resulting to a further rise in the All Share Index (ASI) by 1.47 per cent. Specifically, at the closed of transactions yesterday, the ASI increased by 310.77 absolute points, representing a growth of 1.47 per cent to close at 21,384.03 points. Similarly, the market capitalisation gained N162 billion to close at N11.144 trillion. The upturn was impacted by gains recorded in medium and large capitalised stocks, amongst which are; Nestle Nigeria, Seplat Petroleum Development Company (Seplat), Stanbic IBTC Holdings, Dangote Sugar Refinery and Lafarge Africa. The Chief Operating Officer of InvestData Consulting Limited, Ambrose Omordion said that the seeming strength returning to the market after two months of decline induced by the Coronavirus pandemic at the peak of earnings reporting season has left many stocks attractive, following which they now offer high dividend yields. According to him, this has supported the improved traded volume, in spite of the on-going remote trading, and reveals that investors are taking advantage of the prevailing low prices to accumulate fundamentally sound stocks. Market breath closed positive, recording 24 gainers and 12 losers. Dangote Sugar Refinery recorded the highest price gain of 9.74 per cent, to close at N10.70, while United Bank for Africa (UBA) followed with a gain 9.73 per cent to close at N6.20, per share.
