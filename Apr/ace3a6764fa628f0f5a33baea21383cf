Adamawa decries lack of FG aid as six test negative Plateau State Governor Simon Lalong and members of his family have tested negative to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), two days after going for the test. Based on calls on states’ chief executives to confirm their status after some members of the National Economic Council (NEC) tested positive to the contagious virus, Lalong volunteered his samples and those of his family members, which health officials forwarded to the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) laboratory in Abuja for examination. Yesterday, the results came indicating negative strains for both the governor and members of his family.
In his reaction to the favourable outcome, the governor said he and his family decided to take the test to help dispel the gradually building stigma that make people reluctant to come out, even when they notice symptoms. Stressing that COVID-19 does not equate to a death sentence, Lalong, who is also the chairman of Northern States Governors’ Forum (NSGF) warned: “If we are not careful, people can die out of fear and stigma. “I call on all our citizens, particularly those who notice symptoms of the disease, including difficulty in breathing, fever, cough, sore throat, headache and general fatigue, or have had contact with any infected person, to report to health officials and submit themselves for examination.” The Plateau chief executive disclosed that his administration had continued to take proactive measures, including one-week total lockdown beginning midnight of Thursday, April 9, to prevent movements that could expose the state to the disease. Lalong also assured the people of the state that the NCDC had already approved the establishment of a coronavirus-test centre in Plateau, which will take off very soon and reduce challenges associated with the shuttle to Abuja for testing. He commended the resident for their cooperation and compliance to government’s directives in curbing COVID-19, even as he assured that his administration would not subject them to unnecessary hardship and losses. Also in Adamawa State, six people tested negative of the pandemic ravaging the world. The Commissioner for Health, Professor Abdullahi Isa, told newsmen yesterday in Yola that the blood samples of the six suspected cases were taken to Abuja for test and that after the clinical examination, the results were negative. He said that Chief Emeka Offor Foundation donated one trailer-load of medical equipment to enable the state fight the pandemic, pointing out that the isolation centre at the specialist hospital was relocated to the psychiatric clinic in an isolated area within the hospital to avoid suspected cases interacting with outdoor patients.
