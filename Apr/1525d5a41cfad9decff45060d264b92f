The Iyalaje General of Lagos, Chief (Mrs.) Toyin Afolabi, has appealed to market women and men, especially those who trade in foodstuff and essential services at various markets and stores, not to exploit residents by hiking the price of foodstuff during this period. 
   
Afolabi, in a press release, revealed that there has been a hike in the price of foods all over the state, especially major food markets. “Residents have been lamenting the soaring prices of foodstuffs following the lockdown announced by the government to contain the spread of COVID-19.
   
Iyalaje said: “We need to appeal to our traders to show residents some understanding. We are in trying times, people are struggling to survive, so we should not compound their problems, we should, therefore, be our brothers’ keeper by not increasing the price of foodstuff.
