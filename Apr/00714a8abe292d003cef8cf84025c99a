The Senior Pastor, Grace Impacts Church and Chairman, Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN), Ifako Chapter, Lagos State, Rev. Eseme Unen has appealed to the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) to assist poor Christians, as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to ravage the people. The cleric, who hailed CAN leaders for responding to enormous needs, prayed God to continue to uphold and strengthen them. He said: “At times like this, God has raised you to be the voice and eye of the weak members of the body of Christ in Nigeria. The COVID-19 pandemic means different things to different people in the church, due largely to the prevalence of hunger amid persecution. A large percentage of Christians in the country are hungry for God’s word and food at this time.” While commending churches and well endowed Christians for making donations to federal and state governments to fight the pandemic, Unen said religious leaders could not abandon their own to demonstrate in practical terms the rich virtue of Christian faith. “As we have the opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith. I passionately appeal to CAN leadership to come to the help of Christians,” he said. Unen urged them to mobilise corporate organisations, rich members and mega churches to donate food items and money to be distributed to the vulnerable members, noting that Christians are dying of hunger, a more vicious virus than COVID-19. He advised that a special purpose committee (SPC) should be set up to mobilise donations at CAN level, while each of the five blocks in CAN should set up a coordinating subcommittee to distribute relief materials in the respective blocks so that it will get to local churches across the country.
