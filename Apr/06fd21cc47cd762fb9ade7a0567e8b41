More than 29 days after the Federal Government’s directive, terminal operators and shipping firms are yet to comply with the order to waive demurrage and rents on imported cargoes.
   
The Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), had directed that all terminal operators should suspend all applicable terminal storage fees (demurrage) on consignments for an initial period of 21 days effective March 23. It also extended the demurrage-free period by another 14 days from April 13.
  
In another memo issued on April 8, NPA said it would “grant credit notes commensurate to the rental reliefs granted by the terminal operators to importers within the 21-day free storage period.”  Amiwero however commended NPA for the 21 days waiver and extension to accommodate the period of the lockdown, saying this will bring about stability in the operation of the port, which is opened for skeletal operations.   
   
On the safety of agents, he noted that Licensed Customs Agents are clearly at risk with the daily exposure in continuation of the clearance of goods from the ports at this time of lockdown, without proper protection wares and care by various government agencies.
   
He, therefore, urged government to assist in the provision of protective wares, shuttle buses within the ports environment and provide relief to take care of the hazard Agents go through daily.
   
He further stressed the need for coordinated activities for proper direction of social distancing by all port workers, and the provision of water and sanitizer to save guard Agents and other port users. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
