He also reiterated government’s commitment to the safety of lives and property of Lagos residents. He disclosed this yesterday in commemoration of the World Day for Safety and Health tagged: Stop the Pandemic, Safety and Health can Save Lives. The Word day for Safety and Health is an annual event celebrated globally on 28th of April by the International Labour Organization (ILO), and initiated to create awareness on accident prevention and reduction of work-related illnesses and injuries at work places. According to Mojola, various institutions and governments are faced with challenges of combating the pandemic ravaging the globe and there is a need for continuous campaign on prevention and safety in workplaces. “Occupational health and safety is a global phenomenon, which cannot be ignored or compromised. It is worrisome that Covid-19 infections have posed threats to public health and rise in fatalities, which have led to global economic and social lockdowns, but we must not let our guards down.” The Commissioner, Ministry of Special Duties and Intergovernmental Relations, Engr. Tayo Bamgbose-Martins, commended Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu for his strong leadership, especially during this challenging period.
