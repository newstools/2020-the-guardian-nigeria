The National Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG) has decried alleged harassment and intimidation of oil companies’ workers by security operatives.
 
NUPENG said that these essential workers, who move through difficult and dangerous situations to ensure fuel supplies to Nigerians at this critical period, should be allowed to do their job seamlessly without further harassment by security agencies.
 
To tame the embarrassment on the workers, the union has called on oil companies and the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) to provide adequate security pass for the workers to and from work.  They urged them to provide their members on essential services with sanitizers and other safety kits to protect them and members of their families. “We have continued to receive disturbing reports of harassment and intimidation of our members by the security agents on a daily basis on their way to work and when coming back. These security agents are not contented with the company’s identity card. We, therefore, call on oil companies and the DPR to provide adequate security pass to these workers before the situations degenerate into a crisis.” Meanwhile, the union commended its members on essential services for ensuring uninterrupted supply of petroleum products to every nook and cranny of the country as the nation battles to contain the spread of the coronavirus. The union mentioned the Petroleum Tanker Drivers (PTD), Petrol Stations Workers (PSW), Petroleum Products Depots Workers (PPDW), Oil and Gas Suppliers (OGS), Liquefied Petroleum Gas Retailers (LPGR), and others that had not only made NUPENG proud but the entire labour movement as they moved through difficult and dangerous situations to ensure fuel supplies to Nigerians in this critical period.
