Nigeria Employers’ Consultative Association (NECA) in partnership with Redwood Consulting Limited is offering free NECApreneur entrepreneurship courses for Nigerians.
 
The organisation said the initiative was part of its contributions to the economic and capacity development; supporting access to online education for Nigerians, who have been mandated to stay at home to curb the spread of COVID-19.  
 
The programme will run for a period of six weeks, beginning from April 2020 to June 2020. The Director-General of NECA, Timothy Olawale, said the body decided to open the courses to the general public during the period of pandemic. 
 
“Since, most people are at home and have extra hours, why not help them put the hours to good use by providing relevant trainings such that at the end of this COVID-19 pandemic, they will be armed with skills to help them get prepared for times ahead?,” Olawale said. 
 
Launched as part of the organisation’s mission to influence economic and socio-labour policies in order to create a favourable business environment, NECAPreneur is an e-solution targeted at providing an easy-to-access opportunity for the teeming public to upscale their entrepreneurial skills and ultimately add to national development. 
 
He said the online courses are suitable for anyone at different stages of their entrepreneurial journey, with topics such as – How Anyone Can Start a Business; Market Knowledge; Logistics and Operations and many more.
 
Managing Director, Redwood Consulting Limited, Hannah Oyebanjo, said: “We really hope people take advantage of this free training and prepare themselves for the uncertain times ahead after COVID-19 pandemic.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
