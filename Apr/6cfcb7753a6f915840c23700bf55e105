The Chairman Nigeria League Management Company (LMC), Shehu Dikko says the body would offer support to Nasarawa FC for the burial of late defender, Chineme Martins. He will be laid to rest on April 18. Dikko stated that the LMC was in close contact with Nasarawa FC for the burial arrangements, saying that the club had been discussing with Martins family. He assured that all hands would be on deck in making sure the late footballer is given a successful burial. “LMC is in communication with Nasarawa United on Martins’ burial arrangement. Any programme that is lined up for the players by his family is well accepted. If they wish to hold a private burial for their son or otherwise, it is welcomed by the LMC. We are not happy on the players death and we will continue to sympathise with Martins’ family at this period of mourning. “The committee that was set up to investigate the course of his death will submit its report after the COVID-19 luckdown. At this point, the family of Martins have refused autopsy to be carried on the late footballer to know the actual course of his death. This has also affected the process of getting insurance papers for the late footballer. When the NPFL resumes, all logistics will be put in place to safeguard players medical issues at different league venues,” he stated. It will be recalled that Martins died in an NPFL week 23 league game against Katsina United at Lafia  Township stadium.
