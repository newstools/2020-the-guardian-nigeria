• Plans distribution of food palliatives to 1.7 million households Efforts to increase Nigeria’s testing capacity received a boost yesterday, as a private sector-led Coalition Against COVID-19 (CACOVID), announced that it has ordered for the supply of 250,000 tests kits and additional 150,000 extraction kits to fast-track molecular testing for the Coronavirus.
 
Already, 10,000 test kits, out of the 250,000 have arrived as at Thursday, April 16, the group said, adding that shipment receipt for the rest is expected in the next few weeks.
  
CACOVID has so far realised about N25.8billion from institutions and individuals across the country to help fight the COVID-19 pandemic, even as more contributions are expected from members of the group to support the action.
