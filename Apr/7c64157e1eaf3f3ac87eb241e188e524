The controversies surrounding the sudden break-up of the marriage between U.S.-based Nigerian sprinter, Blessing Okagbare and former Super Eagles player, Jude Ighoteguonor continues. The husband has broken his silence on the divorce saga, saying he had long moved on with his life. In fact, Ighoteguonor stated that he does not need a dime from the sprinter, contrary to earlier reports that the former Enugu Rangers player was seeking a huge sum of N100 million from the sprinter, who filed for the divorce. Okagbare and Ighoteguonor’s marriage was celebrated in Sapele, Delta State in 2014 shortly after the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, Scotland, where she emerged as double sprint champion. But things began to fall apart in 2018, and the couple had reportedly gone their separate ways amid allegations of infidelity, laziness and other irreconcilable differences. Okagbare was said to have filed for a divorce. However, Ighoteguonor told Topsportsafrik yesterday that it was not his style to discuss his marital affairs in public even though they are public figures, but added that he had moved on. “I don’t need a dime from her,” he said. “She filed for a divorce with so many allegations and my lawyers, in turn, replied her lawyer.”
 Ighoteguonor added: “My philosophy in life is very simple. I don’t get hard on myself over material things. I have long moved on since 2018. Women are fragile and sometimes they just want to be let loose and fly only to regret later. She knows me and she knows the truth. “I love my wife, we have come a very long way from my active days as a footballer but when a woman is no longer interested in a relationship, there is nothing you can do about it.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
