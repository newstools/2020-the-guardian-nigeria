The African Development Bank (AfDB) Group has urged that accelerated global health and economic efforts be put in place to help fight the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in Africa, saying the crisis has put the continent’s collective humanity at stake. President, AfDB, Akinwumi Adesina, made this call yesterday, during a webinar of the global Corporate Council on Africa (CCA).
He stressed the need for the United States of America (U.S.A.), African government officials, and corporate executives to forge new and sustainable partnerships that would endure beyond the pandemic, as “one death is one too many.”
 
He noted the compelling need to pay attention to underlying global inequalities, and the impact of the global crisis on rich and poor countries, and urged Africans to be their brothers’ keepers.  Adesina therefore urged multilateral institutions to align and step up their collective efforts with regard to Africa’s debt, manage their ratings, and work together with rating agencies.
 
In her remarks, President and Chief Executive Officer, CCA, Florie Liser, said the COVID-19 pandemic threatens to erase Africa’s unprecedented growth and economic gains over the last decade. She lauded the AfDB’s proactive leadership role in responding to the crisis in Africa. Moderating the webinar, Citi Bank’s, Peter Sullivan, said the pandemic was unprecedented in terms of its health, social, economic, and financial impact, noting that the crisis has significantly hurt economic activity across multiple sectors, including tourism, transportation and commodities.
