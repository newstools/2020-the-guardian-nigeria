Precisely, the ASI decreased by 199.93 absolute points, representing a dip of 0.94 per cent to close at 21,100.54 points. Similarly, the overall market capitalisation size declined by N104 billion to close at N10.997 trillion The downturn was impacted by losses recorded in medium and large capitalised stocks, amongst which are; Dangote Cement, Guinness Nigeria, Flour Mills of Nigeria, Unilever Nigeria and Nigerian Breweries. The Chief Operating Officer of InvestData Consulting Limited, Ambrose Omordion said that the Coronavirus (COVID-19) storm has wrecked many stock markets and economies much more than was seen during the global financial crisis of 2008/2009. He noted that the 14-day lockdown is likely to influence the market negatively because the month of April is an extension of the earnings-reporting season. He urged traders and investors increase their stake in the market to benefit from the corporate actions now that the NSE has given 60 days grace to submit 2019 full-year results. “Market outlook for the month of April and May remains unstable and mixed, but investors should invest wisely, using dates, bids, offers, and volume when taking an investment decision.” Market breadth closed negative, with six gainers versus 26 losers.
