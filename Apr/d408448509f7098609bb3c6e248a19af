We have to make sure that football survives and that it can prosper once again.” Like most other sports, football across the world has been largely halted by the pandemic, which to date has infected nearly a million people and killed more than 47,000. In his message, Infantino said that “these are times of respect for those who suffer and for those who are helping”. “For the first time, football is not the most important thing! Health comes first and must continue until this disease is defeated.” Infantino was speaking by video link to a CONMEBOL Congress in Paraguay.
