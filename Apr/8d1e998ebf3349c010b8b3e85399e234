Four convicted inmates in a Kaduna state prison have died from injuries sustained while attempting to escape from the facility. “4 inmates later died in the hospital from the injuries sustained in the incident that ensued while being restrained by Corrections officers from breaking jail,” spokesman to the Nigeria Correctional Service (NCS) Kaduna State Command Sanusi Danmusa said in a statement on Sunday. “For the avoidance of doubt, all the deceased inmates were from the condemned section of the Custodial Centre.” The inmates attempted to escape from the prison over fears of an alleged suspected case of coronavirus amongst them. A spokesman at the state prison command Nathaniel Gagas also confirmed the attempted jailbreak happened around 1 pm on Tuesday. The attempt was, however, foiled by security operatives as the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) and soldiers blocked all roads leading to the facility located along Independence Way. Other inmates subsequently staged a protest, demanding their freedom to avoid contracting the coronavirus. Danmusa said the command is not hiding any “truth” on the matter, saying the government agency is not trying to get the inmates contracted with coronavirus, as alleged by social media posts. He said a comprehensive investigation has commenced on the directive of the Controller General of the NCS Ja’afaru Ahmed.
