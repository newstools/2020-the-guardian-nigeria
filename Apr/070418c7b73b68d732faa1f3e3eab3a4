Traders and buyers besiege Agbor-obi market on their market day amid coronavirus fears in Agbor, Delta State yesterday. The Coalition for A Better Nigeria has urged the federal and state governments to enforce social distancing in markets and bus parks. It advised that market associations and the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) be compelled to implement the directive. National Coordinator of the group, Awa Bamiji, in a statement, said: “The three tiers of government must do more on enforcement of social spacing, and ensure that the NURTW and market associations follow them.” He also urged the government to compel organisations to provide electronic thermometers and alcohol-based hand sanitisers in all the motor parks, garages, bus stops, markets, buses and cabs, if they must open their businesses at all. “We also advise the three governments, corporate bodies and wealthy individuals to start sharing relief and preventive packages to the downtrodden to make life easier for them at this period, like what is currently obtainable in other countries,” Bamiji added.
