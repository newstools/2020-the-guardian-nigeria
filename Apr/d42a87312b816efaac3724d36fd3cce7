The Nigeria Government on Thursday ordered civil servants from Grade level 14 and above to resume work on Monday, May 4. “Further to Mr President’s broadcast on a phased and gradual easing of the lockdown measures occasioned by COVID-19, officers on GL 14 and above and those in essential services are hereby directed to resume work with effect from Monday, 4th of May, 2020 in the first instance,” head of service Folashade Yemi-Esan said in a circular. “Offices are to open three times a week – Monday, Wednesday and Friday – and close at 2:00 pm on each day.” In late March, the Nigerian Government Monday asked all its non-essential workers on Grade Level 12 and below to work from home until further notice as authorities fight to curtail the spread of coronavirus in the country. Yemi-Esan said at the time that government was concerned about the welfare and safety of all public servants and other Nigerians, hence the need to strictly adhere to the precautionary measures. The head of service, however, assured workers who will resume on Monday that the Federal secretariat complexes have been decontaminated with efforts ongoing to ensure all government offices are safe for work. Yemi-Esan advised all government staff resuming on Monday to limit the number of visitors they receive and ensure that hand-washing facilities are located at every strategic location within their offices.
