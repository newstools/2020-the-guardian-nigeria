Textile workers, under the aegis of National Union of Textile, Garment and Tailoring Workers of Nigeria (NUTGWN), have called on President Muhammadu Buhari to facilitate mass production of locally-made face masks to protect Nigerians against the spread of COVID-19. The union, however, commended government’s decision to impose lockdown in the country to combat the spread of the scourge. The President of NUTGWN, John Adaji, in a statement, called on the Federal and state governments to look inward to procure protective devices and other materials, which Nigeria has the capacity to produce locally. Adaji said: “We commend the Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo Olu, Cross River State Governor, Prof. Ben Ayade and Delta State Governor, Senator Ifeanyi Okowa for supporting local production of face masks. “We call on the Presidential Taskforce on COVID-19 and other state governments to also buy Made-in-Nigeria face masks, hand sanitisers and other protective equipment in line with the Federal Government’s Executive Order for patronage of locally-produced goods.” He urged Nigerians to abide by the safety measures against the pandemic.
