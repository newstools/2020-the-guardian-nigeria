Some members of the Organised Private Sector (OPS), including the Executive Chairman/Founder of BUA Group, Abdul Samad Rabiu has called on Nigerians and Africans to cooperate with respective health authorities and governments in curtailing the spread of the Coronavirus pandemic currently ravaging the world. Abdul Samad Rabiu said the COVID-19 circle can be broken collectively if outlined precautionary measures are strictly observed. According to Abdul Samad, “Africa is recording an increasing number for COVID-19 cases daily and we cannot afford to enable the spread. “If there is anything we have learnt about this virus, it is that it does not respect race, gender, religion, ethnicity or status. “One thing is certain – We can break the cycle if we all come together and fight this virus.No one person can do it alone. Now more than ever, we need each other and we need to come together and fight this virus. “Let us observe social distancing, wash your hands regularly, follow the instructions of health authorities and report any suspected cases immediately. “Each one of us must play our part and we can win this fight against COVID-19. “I am committed to this fight, are you?” Abdul Samad added. So far, BUA has committed about 3billion Naira in cash, foodstuff and medical supplies to the fight against COVID-19. This includes its 1.3billion Naira cash donations to the CA-CACOVID private sector coalition against COVID-19 and some state governments, construction of an isolation centre in Kano as well as donations of foodstuff to various initiatives including the Foodclique/Noella Foundation Emergency FoodBox Initiative that has provided up to 300,000meals during this period. According to Foodclique/Noella Foundation – joint partners to the initiative, each food box contains about 30 meals and as a result, over 300,000 meals in 10,000boxes have so far been distributed across Lagos thanks to the support of corporate and other partners like BUA. Commenting, the Group Head, Corporate Communications, BUA Group, O’tega Ogra said BUA remained committed to partnering with government and non-governmental organisations at all levels against eradicating hunger and catering for the vulnerable in the society especially at a time like this. According to Ogra, “The coronavirus pandemic is hitting hard on the lives of everyone. The vulnerable have been most hit by the economic fallout.
