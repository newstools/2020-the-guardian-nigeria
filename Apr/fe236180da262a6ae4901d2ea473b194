It was the deadliest such attack in the country’s history. Officials said the suspected shooter, Gabriel Wortman, 51, is also dead in a report by The Daily Mail. Several bodies were found inside and outside one home in the small, rural town of Portapique, about 60 miles north of Halifax, what police called the first scene. A police officer was among those killed. Bodies were also found at other locations. Authorities believe the shooter may have targeted his first victims but then began attacking randomly. Among the dead is Royal Canadian Mounted Police member Const. Heidi Stevenson, a 23-year member of the force and a mother-of-two. Two to three others were injured and are being treated at a local hospital, including another Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer. Police said that Wortman’s deadly rampage lasted 12 hours as he went around Nova Scotia in a police uniform killing people, with his victims appearing to be random. They also confirmed at one point he was driving what appeared to be a police vehicle. The tragedy ended shortly before noon local time, when police said Wortman was located at a gas station around 60 miles south of where the shootings occurred. Police are yet to inform the public about the motive for the shooting by Wortman.
