The Ondo Government has extended to May 1, the deadline for the compulsory use of face masks by residents, to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in the state. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Gov. Rotimi Akeredolu had in a press briefing on April 20, set a deadline of April 24, for the compulsory use of face masks as adopted by the six governours of the South-West region. The extension of the deadline is contained in a statement by the state Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Mr Donald Ojogo, and made available to newsmen in Akure on Thursday. The statement noted that the shift in date was as a result of the apparent scarcity of the masks in desirable quantities to affect the enforcement of the directive. “Consequently, May 1, 2020, is now the com­mencement date of the directive jointly adopted by the gover­nors of the South-We­st region among other measures, to curb the spread of the CO­VID-19 pandemic. “Agai­nst this backdrop, the government has intens­ified efforts to pro­duce enough within this period of grace. “Nevertheless, gov­ernment encourages residents of the state who already have theirs to continue to put on the mask for personal safety and protection,” it said.
