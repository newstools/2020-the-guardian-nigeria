Kaduna State governor Nasir El-Rufai on Wednesday made the use of face mask by residents compulsory to prevent the spread of coronavirus. “I have issued another amendment to the Quarantine Regulations requiring everyone in the State to wear a face mask when going out of the home or workplace for any reason,” El-Rufai said in a statement. El-Rufai said the masks will be made available free to the poor and vulnerable groups “and encourage everyone that can afford it to get their neighbourhood tailor to sew cloth masks for their use.” The governor in late March tested positive for coronavirus and announced his recovery from the global pandemic after three weeks of treatment at Kaduna State’s Ministry of Health and the Barau Dikko Teaching Hospital on Wednesday. El-Rufai disclosed that the fear of losing him and getting infected with the disease caused his family members to go through trauma. He described the coronavirus disease as “a threat to our humanity, our lives and livelihoods.” “As someone that has experienced it, I will not wish it on my worst enemy.” The governor reiterated that the mass gathering of people in any form increases the risk of people being infected. “We must, therefore, do everything to avoid exposure and prevent the spread of this disease in our towns and villages,” El-Rufai said. “We must now make the sacrifices of enhanced domestic hygiene, regular hand-washing with soap, staying at home and avoiding crowds to defeat this disease.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
