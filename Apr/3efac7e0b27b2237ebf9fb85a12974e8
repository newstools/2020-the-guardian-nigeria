It is no longer news that Corona Virus is a global attack and Nigerians are not left out in the pandemic. COVID-19 has put fears in the minds of the people, as Nigerians are no longer free to go out and perform their daily activities. Students are not left out as schools were shut by the government to prevent a further spread of the scourge. Many measures have been put in place to further control and prevent the spread of this deadly virus; schools, religious gatherings and markets are not exempted in order to keep up with the preventive measures. Nigerian students hope that COVID-19 will end soon as it is hard for them to cope. Some of the students even made a joke of the issue saying that the virus is boring. With the increase in the number of index cases, many have poured out their minds and provide possible solutions to help curb and bring an end to the deadly virus. In an interview with Preacher Adeleke, a 300 level mathematics student of Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta, he said,
“Corona Virus is dangerous and deadly, but my own view about it is that it does not automatically mean death. We have had cases of people who contacted the virus for the past three to four weeks and are not dead up till now, so I believe the fear of the virus could be more dangerous than the virus itself. If we can take precautions and obey the instructions given, then I believe we are on the right path to stop the spread of the virus. Adesola Ikulajolu, a final year student of mass communication department at Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba (AAUA) was of the opinion that COVID-19 is a global outbreak, which not only affects him but other students as well. “The painful aspect of it is the ‘stay at home’ instruction.” Although the move is to allow government control the menace, this will give students setbacks in their academics. Even the number of months to be spent at home is not known to anyone yet. Fasilat Rauf, a 500 level law student from the University of Ibadan (UI) added,  “Our leaders should further the course of true leadership. Little money is usually allocated to the health sector, when all this is gone, they should endeavor to restructure and do the needful in the health sector rather than having their head at home and anus abroad.” Obafemii Awolowo University (OAU) students are not left out in the matter. For Miracle Olajuyigbe, a 300l medicine and surgery student of the school lamented the scourge He said, “This is not in anyway the best definition of unity, our leaders probably by now must learn to invest more in the country (particularly the health sector) rather than going outside the country.  Leadership must be seen as an avenue to serve the masses and not to enrich the pocket as this has taught almost everyone that Nigeria is our home and it should not be neglected at anytime.” Babatunde Balogun, a 300 level student from the department of Philosophy at the University of Ibadan said the virus at first looked flimsy to him, as he is not pleased with the house arrest order. Abiodun Oyekanmi, a 300 level political science student of the University of Ibadan said he was particularly surprised at the mode of transmission of the virus that he finds it too hard and unacceptable.so he urged Nigerian leaders to rise and give their possible best to eradicate the scourge.
