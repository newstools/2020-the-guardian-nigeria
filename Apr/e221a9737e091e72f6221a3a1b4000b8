The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) has not advertised for applications for a new coach for the Super Eagles, an official of the federation has said. Many coaches have been jostling to take over Gernot Rohr’s job since the NFF brought out conditions that the German must meet before getting a new contract. Recently, former Super Eagles’ handlers, Clemens Westerhof, Jo Bonfere and Sunday Oliseh, as well as former Nigerian forward, Emmanuel Amuneke have been bandied as those interested in taking over the job. However, Oliseh and Amuneke have since denied showing interest or having been contacted by the NFF on the possibility of taking over from the Rohr.
Speaking to The Guardian, Super Eagles’ Media Officer, Toyin Ibitoye said all reports concerning the interest of some coaches to take over  Rohr’s job were speculations. “The NFF has not declared Gernot Rohr’s position vacant. I don’t know where the news that different coaches have been contacted by the NFF to coach the Super Eagles is coming from. “Rohr’s contract as the Super Eagles coach is still on till June and the NFF has sent him a new contract guidelines to sign.“I believe at the end of the day, everything will be sorted out by both parties because Rohr is still interested in coaching the Super Eagles. “If there is any issue that emanates from the contract, the NFF will issue an official information on that to the media. Rohr is still in charge of the Super Eagles and he is in a cordial relationship with the NFF,” he said. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
