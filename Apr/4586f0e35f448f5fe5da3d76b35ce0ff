Dele Adeyemi, a graduate of Moshood Abiola Polytechnic and beneficiary of NPower, was on Sunday stabbed to death by suspected cult members at Iyana Oloke area of Abeokuta, Ogun State on Sunday at about 10:00p.m. The family of Dele has, therefore, appealed to the Ogun State governor, Dapo Abiodun, and the Commissioner of Police, Kenneth Ebrimson, to ensure that justice is served and the killers of their son are brought to book. The deceased, aged 36, who is survived by his parents, wife, aged 32, daughter, aged 10 and son (eight months old) was in the company of his friends on the night he was killed when he was attacked by seven men who were in their 20s. According to an eyewitness who also happened to be Dele’s friend, he narrated that an argument had ensued between the residents and the cult members when they hurriedly went to call their gang members to defend them. “It was such an unfortunate night because it could have been anyone in the neighborhood that those cultists killed. On that night, we were relaxing at the front of our house because there was no electricity when Dele’s killers arrived in a car; they hooted the horn for us to open the residential gate for them. We simply told them that the security person on duty was not around but they prevailed on us to open the gate and we did. “We, however, told them not to take the same route when they are returning because we would not open the gate for them as the security men were not around. After some minutes, they returned insisting that we must open the gate but we refused and that they should take another route and so they left in annoyance. “But they returned with some other people and started raining insults on us. We just ignored them and left. After some time, we noticed that some people were running after us, we saw knives, cutlasses and other harmful objects and so we started running but Dele was not so lucky as he was killed at that spot. He was stabbed severally.” Also, a sister of the deceased hinted that the case has been reported at Adigbe Police Station and was later transferred to State Criminal Investigation Department, Eleweran on Monday. She added that four out of the seven suspected cultists have been arrested while the remaining three are still on the run. “We want justice for Dele, the case must not be swept under the carpet. Everyone involved must be brought to book. My brother is survived by two children and a young wife, how do they want them to survive. We appeal to the governor and Commissioner of Police to bring the culprits to book. This is so painful,” she lamented.
