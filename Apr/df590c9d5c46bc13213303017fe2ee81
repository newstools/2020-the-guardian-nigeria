World number one, Odunayo Adekuoroye, still believes she will become an Olympic champion despite the shift in date for the Tokyo 2020 Games originally scheduled for between July 24 and August 9, 2020. The Games will now hold from July 23, 2021 to August 8, 2021 due to the Corona Virus (COVID -19) scourge that has paralysed activities all over the world. Adekuoroye, who got a boost in her quest to fulfill her ambition from the Halogen Group through the adopt-an-athlete initiative by the Minister of Sports and Youth Development, Sunday Dare, said she had been training in earnest to fulfill her dream until the pandemic began and caused the postponement of the Games. Speaking to The Guardian yesterday, Adekuoroye said the postponement would only delay her medal hope, adding,  “It is only when there is a competition that one can compete. I do not really feel bad about what is happening right now that have led to the cancellation of the Olympics. “One just has to take the COVID-19 crisis in good fate and I pray that everything will come back to normal so that I will start training again for the Olympics,” she said, adding, “I still believe in my dream of becoming an Olympic champion. It may only be delayed but I am sure it will surely manifest by His grace. I still train at home, making sure that I keep fit. “When the crisis began, the Chief Executive Officer of Halogen Group, Mr. Wale Olaoye, sent me a message, encouraging me that I shouldn’t lose hope that everything will go according to plans.” Adekuoroye qualified for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics by virtue of her bronze medal winning effort at the 2019 World Wrestling Championship in Kazakhstan.
