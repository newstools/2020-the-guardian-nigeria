Two officers of Nigeria police have tested positive for coronavirus in Ondo State. Ondo State governor Rotimi Akeredolu made the disclosure during his weekly broadcast on COVID19 in the state. Currently, Ondo State has eight cases of coronavirus after recording five cases over the weekend. “The fourth and fifth Cases occurred on Saturday while the sixth, seventh and eighth Cases were discovered yesterday, Sunday,” Akeredolu said. “The fourth and fifth Cases are officers of the Nigerian Police Force, serving under the Lagos State Police Command.” Akeredolu on Sunday disclosed that one of the arrested suspects in the murder of Funke Olakunrin tested positive for coronavirus. The governor disclosed that the seventh coronavirus case “was a female civilian who sneaked into the State from Abuja. Meanwhile, the eighth case was discovered in Owo and samples taken were confirmed positive late last night.” To curtail a further spread of coronavirus in the state, Akeredolu said he has directed the wider processes to trace, isolate and test all primary and secondary contacts with all the cases while at large in the state. Akeredolu said himself and other governors in the country “are seriously worried about the implications of the existing measures on the self-preservation, well-being and prosperity of our people.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
