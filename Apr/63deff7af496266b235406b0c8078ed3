A group of pastors and church members filed a suit against Gov. Gavin Newsom. Image American Magazine A group of pastors and church members filed a suit against Gov. Gavin Newsom claiming religious services are “essential for the spiritual health of the congregation so that the congregants can exhort one another during these difficult times.” In the lawsuit documents, one pastor believes they can hold services so long as they abide by social distancing tips recommended by the CDC, like keeping congregants at least 6 feet apart and requiring they wear masks and gloves according to TMZ. The leaders claim California’s “shelter-at-home” mandate coupled with its “essential workforce” criteria has denied religious groups their fundamental right to continue congregating. To buttress their points, one pastor claims he was fined $1,000 for holding service on Palm Sunday. The church leaders are really angry they can’t hold services even after they disinfect churches and practice social distancing. According to the suit, they’re also angry at the fact that burger flippers and laundromat technicians are considered “essential” while attending church is not. The battle between governors and churches got worse this Easter with more than a handful of defying “shelter-at-home” orders. The church leaders are suing to get Governor Newsom’s lockdown order declared unconstitutional for infringing on their right to freely assemble and exercise their religions.
