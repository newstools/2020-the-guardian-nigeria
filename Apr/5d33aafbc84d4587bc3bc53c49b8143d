There is no more case of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Enugu State, as the last patient has been discharged barely 24 hours after the first was released. The Commissioner for Health, Prof. Ikechukwu Obi, disclosed this in a statement on Thursday night. Obi stated that the last patient had recovered, hence tested negative to the virus. The state’s Ministry of Health on Wednesday announced that one patient had been discharged. The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) had announced two cases of COVID-19 in the state that were in isolation and receiving care. According to Obi, two of them are now negative for COVID-19 and have been discharged. “We encourage our people to continue to stay at home, try not to touch your face without having washed your hands, maintain strict hand and respiratory hygiene, wear a face mask in line with NCDC’s advisory and maintain physical distancing,” he said. The commissioner appealed to the people to call the designated helplines to report any suspected case of COVID-19.
