To be ready for action whenever the Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) resumes, Mountain of Fire Ministries Football Club (MFM) coach, Tony Bolus, has resorted to training his team online with well-planned programmes. The NPFL was suspended following the Coronavirus outbreak, which has grounded all sporting activities across the world. Bolus admitted that the break in the league affected MFM FC’s continuous build-up and programme aimed at bringing the club at par with the top teams on the table. He noted, however, that despite the Coronavirus break, he still monitored the training and eating schedule of his players to ensure they kept 100 percent fit and healthy for the challenges ahead. “The unexpected Coronavirus break has given some of my injured players enough chance to recover. “I miss the excitement that comes in every league game, especially the battles among teams to be at the top of the table. “But the break has not affected communication with my players. On a daily basis, I send them training schedules and materials online and I tell them to record the training exercise via video and send the visuals back to me. “Through this, I can confirm if my instructions were carried out. The response has been good and I can assure our fans that MFM players will be in top form when the league resumes. “Monitoring the activities of players is important at this period because it will safeguard the team from fatigue issues and health challenges when the league resumes. Our target is to keep moving up in the NPFL league log,” he said.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
