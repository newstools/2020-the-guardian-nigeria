The announcement comes a day before Iran is scheduled to reopen “low-risk” businesses in a move aimed at protecting its sanctions-hit economy. Iran announced its first coronavirus cases on February 19. There has been speculation abroad that the real number of deaths and infections in the country could be higher. In response to the health crisis, Iran shut schools and universities as well as cinemas, stadiums and revered Shiite Muslim shrines. It also warned people to refrain from travel for the Persian New Year holidays that ended last week. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
