The coming of COVID-19 has created spurious and fantastic narratives, types of which are usually spun around tumultuous events. Specifically, conspiracy theorists are curiously contending that rolling out the fifth generation (5G) network by the Chinese and other stakeholders is the cause of the pandemic that has gripped the world since December 2019. Social media is abuzz with a potpourri of prognostications ranging from the sublime to the outright ridiculous. The time has come for the science community as represented by the Nigerian Academy of Science (NAS) to make a definitive statement on the connection, if any, between 5G and COVID-19, especially as it concerns Nigeria. 
 
The Minister of Communication and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Pantami has made a definite statement that no organisation has been licensed to install 5G cables in Nigeria. According to him, a “three-month study trial commenced on the 25th of November 2019 in order to critically review and study the health and security implications of deploying 5G in Nigeria.” Some religious pastors have, however, linked COVID-19 with end-time prophecies, saying that 5G was “part of the new world order where some figures of authority in the world were trying to build a religion, economy, and government for the entire universe.” One of them had even linked microchips with the forthcoming apocalypse. Different videos apparently illustrating the danger of 5G have been in circulation. Counter narratives, however, have also been created to make nonsense of conspiracy theories. 5G is the latest or fifth generation of wireless communication. It is reported to be ten times faster than 4G. Countries across the world are signing on to this new technology because it is the signpost of the future. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is based on this new technology. 
 
The question is: What is 5G? Are there components of this technology that are potentially injurious to man? Does it pose a security threat to nations and individual or personal security? Are the conspiracy theories part of superpower rivalry? What is the nexus between the pandemic and the new technology? If 5G is indeed dangerous to man’s stay, if it has the capacity to destroy lives as COVID-19 is currently doing, why would it still be installed anywhere in the world?
