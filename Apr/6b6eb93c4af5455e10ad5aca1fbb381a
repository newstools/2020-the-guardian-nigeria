Gov. Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta says the Centre for Communicable Diseases and Research built by the State Government at the Federal Medical Centre, Asaba, is ready for use. The governor disclosed this after inspecting the facility on Thursday. Okowa said all facilities required to make the centre receive and treat COVID-19 patients were ready. Okowa said that relevant staff had been trained for the centre. “I just finished inspecting the Centre for Communicable Diseases and Research at the Federal Medical Centre, Asaba. “The centre is fully ready; all the necessary facilities are in place, including ventilators which have been installed. “And very importantly, there is a side room where the nurses are able to completely monitor every activity going on in every room, and which is really very good. “The dialysis machine is already being installed now, although that is not something that will be required by most patients. “A very little percentage of the patients will require the dialysis machine, but with all these in place, we can say that the centre is fully ready, and trained staff are fully ready to receive any case,” he said. The governor, who was accompanied by the Commissioner for Health, Dr Mordi Ononye and Commissioner for  Information, Mr Charles Aniagwu, visited the Isolation Centre at Asaba Specialist Hospital. The team also inspected medical equipment donated to the state government by some companies operating in the state.
