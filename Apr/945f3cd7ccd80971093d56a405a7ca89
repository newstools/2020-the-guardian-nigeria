 Some of the Pelican Stars’ players with their placards at the entrance to the Cross River State Governor’s Office in Calabar…yesterday.<br />PHOTO: AGOSI TODO  They also carried placards with inscriptions that read, “Please our digital governor come to our aid, due to hunger, one of our players is hospitalized, we are bread winners of our families.” Speaking to newsmen, the team captain, Odo Williams lamented that the state government has owed them for 10 months, adding that most of the players have to beg before they can eat or buy their sanitary pads. She said one of their players was rushed to the general hospital last Friday and the doctor said she has ulcer. Williams said, “We came to visit our father which is the governor, we have not been paid our 10 months salary. “One of our players slumped and she is in the general hospital suffering from ulcer and it is caused by hunger. We need money; the situation is so bad that we have to go to our management to ask for money for pad. “Just on Friday, as a result of hunger, one of our players, Awotunbo Shola is in general hospital suffering from ulcer so that is why we are here to beg the governor to please come to our aid.” Incidentally, the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) Chairman, Comrade Ben Ukpepi was driving past the area when he saw the protesters. He stopped and addressed them, saying, “Your action is right because a labourer deserves his wage. We were not aware until last week, when I received a letter from you. “It is possible that that his Excellency is not aware of this, but I assure you that I will reach out to the governor on your plight to know the reason why this has not been done and I believe that you will be paid soon.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
