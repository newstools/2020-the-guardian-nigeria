To further reduce the spread of COVID-19, the Miners Association of Nigeria (MAN) has suspended mining and allied activities in Nigeria until further notice in the interest of the public. 
 
The directive, the group said, was imperative given the volatility of social interactions in mining communities, and the high rate of mobility of mineworkers, even across the borders, adding that window of entry of the virus into any of its minefields may impact efforts at curbing the spread.
 
National President, MAN, Kabiru Mohammed and Secretary, Dele Ayanleke, said the decision was taken in the best interest of the public and to assist government, health authorities and all stakeholders fight the deadly disease ravaging the country.
