Researchers from Harvard Medical School have filed a case report about a 42-year-old man who tested positive for coronavirus, after going to the hospital with a ‘stabbing pain’ in his testicles according to The Mirror. While doctors could find nothing wrong with his testicles, CT scan showed damage in his lungs. Two days later, the man was diagnosed with COVID-19. Unfortunately, because the man had atypical symptoms, several other patients and doctors may have unknowingly been exposed to the virus. According to a published report in The American Journal of Emergency Medicine, the researchers, led by Jesi Kim, wrote: The patient described in this case report was not demonstrating any respiratory symptoms nor was the team aware that the patient was recently tested prior to his ED visit, therefore, proper PPE was not worn by the treating HCW’s [healthcare workers]. As a result, over 25 patients and HCW’s were notified of their potential exposure. While it remains unclear whether or not his testicular pain was like to the virus, other viruses have been known to affect the testicles such as mumps according to Dr. Viney, a surgeon in Birmingham. In her words: Only time will tell if COVID-19 also affects the testicles but it isn’t a symptom many of the patients I’ve dealt with have complained about. For most of them, their testicles are the least of their worries.
