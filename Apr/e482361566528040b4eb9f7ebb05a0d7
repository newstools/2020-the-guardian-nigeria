Rising football player, Timisire Adedoyin has expressed hope of playing for the Nigerian national team soon. The talented right back said he also wants to make a big splash in the European league. Speaking in Lagos, the 20 year-old said he hopes to emulate former Super Eagles captain, John Obi Mikel, whom he said has impressed him the most. Adedoyin, who had a one-year stint in the Azerbaijan league, where he played for Insensor FK,  a division three side,  admitted that the path to professional football stardom for many Nigerian players was fraught with daunting challenges. “But with hard work, perseverance and good play, the road to glory is assured.” Reflecting on his time in the Azerbaijan league,  Adedoyin, who also play as a wing back depending on the formation of the coach,  said he had a good experience but his desire to go for the best made him to quit the country as he aims to land a juicy deal in one of the top five leagues in Europe. “My time in Azerbaijan was not bad,” he stated.  “But it was also an eye-opener in many ways.  I am a right full back, but I can play as a wingback depending on the formation of the team.  My role model is Dani Alves because he is one of the best players in that position and everybody playing in that wing looks up to him as their inspiration. “I am a team player and I also have the technical ability because of my exposure of playing abroad. Football has always been my passion and there is nothing more I want than to play professional football for a living. “It is the dream of every footballer to play for the national team and my prayer is to have an invitation to prove my worth. If it comes, I will not disappoint the coaches and Nigerian football fans,” He stated.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
