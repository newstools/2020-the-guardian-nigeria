But when he does, the 27-year-old star says any future partner will have to share his faith. In his words It’s nice to survive with your companion by your side. I’m sure it’s a good thing. But I’ve never experienced it. I do know, however, that she’s got to be Christian. His father Samson is a Pentecostal minister and John was raised in a deeply religious family. Although he drifted away from Christianity as he grew up he has now returned to it, he said, revealing he prays twice a day as revealed in the magazine. His religion is what helps him deal with the pressures of fame, adding that money doesn’t have ‘power’ over him. A local theatre director spotted his potential during a performance when he was nine. He went to the Identity School of Acting in Hackney aged 16, which helped him win roles on the stage and small screen. John sprang to worldwide fame in 2015 when he appeared as Finn in Star Wars blockbuster The Force Awakens. Earlier this year, John shared a heart-warming video of the moment he told his parents he had bought them a house. He left fans in tears when he uploaded a wonderful video of himself breaking the news to his parents Abigail and Samson, revealing it had been shot a ‘few years ago’. Boyega’s other credits include historical drama film Detroit (2017), the science fiction film Pacific Rim: Uprising (2018), four episodes of the television series 24: Live Another Day and the drama Imperial Dreams (2014). Boyega received the BAFTA Rising Star Award in 2016.
