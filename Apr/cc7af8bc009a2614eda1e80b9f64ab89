The Kebbi State police command has warned youths against preparing and consuming poisonous leaf delicacy during marriages and ceremonies in the state. The Commissioner of Police in the state, Agunbiade Oluyemi-Lasore, gave the warning in a statement signed by the command’s Public Relations Officer, DSP Nafi’u Abubakar, in Birnin Kebbi on Monday. The statement lamented the high rate at which youths were dying as a result of consumption of the poisonous leaf: Babbajiji, during marriages and other social ceremonies in the state. It said: “The Kebbi State Police Command hereby warns members of the general public to desist from using the poisonous leaf in preparing their delicacy for any gathering in the state. Anybody caught would be arrested and prosecuted according to the law.” Babbajiji leaf is suspected to be used by youths as a form of hard drug, but its consumption is capable of causing the death of the user. “Our command observed recently that a lot of youths have died through this channel. People should be very careful the type of food they eat in any wedding ceremonies,” he said, urging residents to desist from using such poisonous leaf in preparing their delicacy for any gathering in the state.
