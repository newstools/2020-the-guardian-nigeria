The executive of the Super Eagles Supporters Club (SESC) has given financial support to 100 of its indigent members to cushion the hardship they are facing following the lockdown ordered by the Federal Government due to the coronavirus. According to the President of the SESC, Prince Vincent Okumagba, the Supporters Club, through the various states’ chairmen, collated the list of some of their indigent members. “The members received various sums of money ranging from N5, 000 to N10, 000, which were credited directly to their accounts,” Okumagba told The Guardian. “We are aware that people are going through a lot of difficulties, but the idea was to help them to mitigate the effects of the lockdown,” he stated. Okumagba added that he raised the fund for the support saying: “There was support from a few other affluent members of the SESC. Being in the SESC has afforded the members opportunity to see each other as a family hence everyone looks out for the other. “Members of the club have individually and collectively paid some price in supporting the nation’s interest hence it will be abnormal to abandon them at this difficult time,” he stated. According to Okumagba, the distribution of the palliative was handled by a committee selected from among the 28 State Chairmen of the Club from all the zones of the country. Okumagba advised members of the Super Eagles’ Supporters Club and Nigerians to totally adhere to all advice from medical personnel including the social distancing as well as keeping high-level personal hygiene to curtail the spread of the coronavirus.
