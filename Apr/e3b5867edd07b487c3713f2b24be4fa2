The attack took place as the villagers were “returning home” though a zone that the authorities have said is dangerous after 6 pm, the official said. Amchide is a small trading village in Cameroon’s Far North province, a tongue of land that lies between Chad to the east and Nigeria to the west. The province has been hit since 2014 by Boko Haram fighters making incursions from northeast Nigeria. The jihadists’ campaign has killed more than 27,000 people since 2009, several thousand of them in Cameroon, and displaced more than two million, sparking a dire humanitarian crisis in the Lake Chad region. According to Amnesty International, at least 275 people were killed in the Far North last year. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
