The Remo Growth and Development Foundation (RGDF) in Ogun State has called for a concerted effort from government, stakeholders, private sector and well-meaning Nigerians to ensure the aged, senior citizens and vulnerable persons are adequately taken care of during this lockdown. The group noted that it was important to provide the senor citizens, who are more in Ogun State with nourishing food items as supplements, because their immune systems are weak and are in dire need of nutrition and healthcare during the lockdown. To cushion the effects ofÂ COVID-19 lockdown in Ogun State, the Remo Growth and Development Foundation (RGDF) flagged off distribution of food and other relief materials to the old, aged and vulnerable members of the community.
