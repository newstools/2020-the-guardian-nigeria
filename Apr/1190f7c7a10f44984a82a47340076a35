The daily life of a young African is not the same as that of a young Frenchman,” said the former Marseille and Chelsea striker and captain of the Ivorian national team. A total of 1,000 families in 11 areas of the Ivorian economic capital will receive soap, sanitising gel, rice, cooking oil and sugar over 11 days, said the organisers. “Sharing values are important for artists. Culture can be at the service of society,” said A’Salfo. On Sunday, Drogba offered his foundation’s hospital to the Ivorian state as a testing centre. Organisers said that during its first phase from April 2-9, the caravan distributed aid worth 150 million CFA francs (about 230,000 euros) to 5,000 families. Ivory Coast has 688 cases of coronavirus, including six deaths, according to the latest official report on Thursday.
