The Police in Lagos yesterday freed the leader of Resurrection Praise Chapel, aka ‘Jehovah Sharp-Sharp,’ Archbishop Samson Mustapha Benjamin, and two others- Jerry Abel and Johnson Benjamin- following the perfection of their bail. The State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department (SCIID) in Panti, Yaba, released Benjamin and the others after they met the bail condition granted them by an Igbosere Magistrates’ Court. Benjamin, Jerry and Johnson were granted bail on April 22, this year by Chief Magistrate, Mrs. Yewande Oshin, who ordered their remand in the SCIID’s custody after they pleaded not guilty to a three-count charge bordering on lockdown violation. The Lagos State Government had accused the cleric and the two others of “failure to stay at home, contrary to COVID-19 Regulations” and “conduct likely to cause breach of peace.” Mrs. Oshin granted Benjamin N1million bail and remanded him, pending fulfillment of the terms, while Abel and Johnson were each granted N500, 000 bail.
According to the information filed by the prosecution against the cleric, he was alleged to have led about 100 persons to the Chinese Embassy on Victoria Island, Lagos to protest alleged ill-treatment of Nigerians in China, despite operating freely in Nigeria.The Embassy officials sent a video clip of the alleged invasion to the Police, which led to his arrest.
