Nasarawa state government has extended its lockdown order by 10 more days as stricter measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus in the state. Governor Abdullahi Sule made the declaration on the extension on Thursday at the government house, Lafia, acknowledging the people are going through hardship due to the lockdown but appealed to them to abide by the lockdown order to stop the virus spreading. “The cessation of human and vehicular movement and total lockdown of Karu Local Government Area shall continue, except on Wednesdays and Saturdays between 10:00 am to 2:00 pm to enable residents purchase essentials within their neighborhoods and not beyond. All social gatherings remain suspended. Any child seen on the street begging should be arrested by the security agents and handed over to the welfare departments of the State Government and the respective Local Government Councils. All worship and event centres, cinemas and viewing centres, sports arena, clubs and beer parlours are to remain closed.” He appealed to residents to keep to the social distancing directive of the federal government. To cushion the hardship, Sule said that 1200 bags of rice have been dispatched to the 13 local governments each for low or no income earners, assuring that more relief material shall be distributed to every household.
