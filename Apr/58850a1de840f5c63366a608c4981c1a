With the increasing cases of Coronavirus cases in Nigeria, the Advertising Practitioners Council of Nigeria (APCON) has temporarily suspended its services. Its Acting Registrar/CEO, Mrs. Ijedi Iyoha, told The Guardian that, “APCON is determined to comply with appropriate measures/directives by the Federal Government in curtailing the scourge.” While calling on the public to take advantage of the council’s online vetting platform in accessing its services for the time being, Iyoha warned against non-compliance with regulations, as the organisation would impose penalties where necessary at the end of the lockdown.
