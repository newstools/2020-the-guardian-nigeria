Gov. Gboyega Oyetola of Osun has called on Christians to emulate the good virtues of Jesus Christ by making sacrifices that would advance development of the state as they celebrate His death and resurrection. Oyetola, in his Easter message on Saturday in Osogbo, said “Easter exemplifies the sacrifice that Jesus paid to save mankind”, urging Christians to take into consideration the welfare of others as they celebrate Easter. The governor also called on the people of the state to re-dedicate themselves to the service of God and mankind as they reflect on the ideals of Good Friday and Easter Celebration. Oyetola urged Christians to also use the occasion to intensify prayers and devotion for God’s intervention as the country and the world at large were fighting the scourge of Coronavirus. He appealed to them to be their brothers’ keepers by reaching out to the less privileged around them. The governor said that the lockdown imposed to curb the spread of COVID-19 in the state had expanded the population of the needy and the vulnerable group. “As the country and the world are ravaged by the Coronavirus pandemic, Christians should use the time to portray good Christianity and reach out to the less privileged around them. “I wish the people of the state Happy Easter Celebrations, and I can assure you that this administration is committed to people’s welfare,” the governor said. Oyetola, however, said that the stay-at-home order was still in force, urging residents of the state to continue to adhere to the directive and observe all other preventive measures.
