• State in partial lockdown as scores of truck trapped at toll-gate
• Makinde contracted COVID-19 in Abuja, says Oyo govt The Ogun State government yesterday confirmed a new case of Coronavirus (COVID-19), bringing the total number of cases recorded so far in the state to four. The state’s Commissioner for Health, Dr. Tomi Coker, who disclosed this at a press conference in Abeokuta, the state capital, said that the new case was one of the 32 contacts of the third patient, a 62-year-old man who recently returned from the United Kingdom (UK). The commissioner added that the new case was a 30-year-old female from Sagamu area of the state tested positive to COVID-19 and being treated at the isolation centre in Olabisi Onabanjo University Teaching Hospital (OOUTH), Sagamu, Ogun State. The commissioner raised the alarm that some mothers in the state were giving their children hand sanitisers to drink to protect them against contracting Coronavirus. She debunked the myth that drinking hand sanitiser can prevent the spread of the virus and warned them to desist from engaging in such act, saying: “There are mothers that are actually giving their children sanitisers to drink. There is no evidence that giving sanitisers to children will prevent COVID-19. So, we encourage such people to cease from doing this,” the commissioner said. Meanwhile, it was partial lockdown in Sango area of the state yesterday, as several trucks were trapped at the tollgate border between Lagos and Ogun State. The Guardian observed that there were partial business operations by the corporate and private business entities going by the state government’s decision to postpone the total lockdown till Friday. Already, the toll-gate has been barricaded by security officials, while other routes into the state, such as Ikola Road, Navy Road, Agbara, among others, have been shut to traffic. In another development, the Chief Press Secretary to Governor Seyi Makinde, Mr. Taiwo Adisa, yesterday explained that his principal contracted Coronavirus with known people in Abuja. While speaking on a television programme, Adisa said there is no need to politicise the issue of COVID-19 pandemic.He said that the issue of People’s Democratic Party (PDP) rally on March 18, 2020 doesn’t come to play because there was no known incident of the virus in Oyo State as at then. He said that the governor did not also have any symptom(s) at that time. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
