The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control on Wednesday disclosed that 80% of persons with the novel coronavirus have mild form of it. “Current evidence shows that about 80% of persons with #COVID19 have the mild form of the disease and recover with minimal management,” NCDC medical officer Sandra Mbah said during  tweet chat with The Guardian on Wednesday. “Our current protocol is to have all cases managed by a team of clinicians in a treatment centre to ensure we have good recovery rate.” The commission’s medical officer said she believed that Nigerians can practice the homecare approach to Covid-19 treatment. She said cases that are classified as mild can self-isolate and be managed at home with routine checks by healthcare workers who are supported to do so. “This has not yet taken effect in Nigeria,” Mbah, however, said. As of 11:00 pm 14th April, there are 373 confirmed cases of #COVID19 reported in Nigeria. 99 persons have been discharged with 11 deaths. NCDC, however, announced on Tuesday that it will start testing 3000 samples per day in Lagos State and Abuja. Both places are the hardest hit by coronavirus and have been under lockdown since the end of March. “To measure efficiency in #COVID19 testing, we set a target to test 2000 samples per day in Lagos & 1000 per day in Abuja,” Director General, Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, Chikwe Ihekweazu said on AIT’s Newshour. “Sometimes it’s not a lack of resources that may lead to inefficiency but the inability to connect the dots.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
