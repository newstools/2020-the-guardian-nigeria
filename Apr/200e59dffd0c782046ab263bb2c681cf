The Kaduna State Commissioner for Human Development and Social Services, Hajiya Hafsat Baba, has said that three orphanages have been slated for demolition. The commissioner said the three orphanage homes being investigated for alleged child trafficking are located in Barnawa, Sabon Tasha and Narayi communities. She added that already, a strong message has been sent to the leadership of the orphanages that the state government will not tolerate any illegal activity of any type, noting that recently, some suspected child traffickers were arrested and investigation is ongoing. “If they are found guilty their orphanage homes will be demolished. If they owned the houses, it will be demolished; if they are renting the premises for use as orphanage homes, the C-of-O will be revoked. We will not tolerate people coming to set up under the guise of orphanage while they are doing illegal businesses, especially child trafficking. “We have a law on this in Kaduna and it’s unacceptable. This is a government that will not tolerate such thing because we have to set up example to others so that others will also learn,” she said.Hajiya Hafsat ‎also warned most orphanages that they have no right not to give the children for adoption because they children belong to the government. “We are also investigating this new idea of keeping the children for safe keeping as claimed by some orphanages because we will not tolerate using the children to make money. We will not accept any orphanages keeping children until they grow up because we believe every child needs parent and home to live in,” she said.
