The police on Thursday advised Nigerians not to defy the coronavirus prevention of staying at home and social distancing during Easter celebration. The inspector general of police Mohammed Adamu in a statement said all preventive measures against the spread of coronavirus by states and the federal government are still in effect regardless of events. Adamu directed the commissioners of police in states where the social restriction orders have been emplaced to continue with the due enforcement of the orders. The IGP calls on religious leaders in Lagos, Ogun and the FCT) as well as other States affected by the restriction orders, to continue to cooperate with relevant government agencies and use their leadership positions to encourage worshippers to observe prayers and worship programs in the confines of their homes. He noted that adherence to the restrictions is necessary to curtail the “community spread of the COVID-19 pandemic which has immensely challenged humanity across all spheres of life.” Adamu expressed concerns that circumstances have compelled the police to emplace restrictions on social gatherings, which inevitably is also affecting religious programs of all faiths. He enjoins Nigerians to see the restrictions in the “light of the symbolism of Easter which connotes sacrifice, tolerance, perseverance, love and ultimate triumph.” Adamu assured Nigerians that the police will remain steadfast and committed in the duty of ensuring public safety and security during the Easter period and beyond.
