According to a respected cabinet member of Onicha Ugbo palace, Chief Ken Iwelumo, “Last night, April 26, 2020, Onicha Ugbo received a shipment of 600 bags of high quality rice from Mr. Tony Elumelu, the Group Chairman of UBA Group and Heirs Holdings. “This is a gift to his motherland. Words cannot express our gratitude to him during these difficult and uncertain times. “We pray that our good lord will continue to shower eternal blessings on him, his family and Elumelu clan”. It was gathered that the gesture by the titan of Africa’s financial sector is to cushion the effect of the lockdown and also to appreciate his people on behalf of his loving mother and his amiable junior brother, Rt. Hon. Ndudi Elumelu who is the minority leader in Nigeria’s House of Representative. He represents AniochaOshimili Federal Constituency. Elumelu has changed the lives of African young start ups through his Tony Elumelu Foundation.
