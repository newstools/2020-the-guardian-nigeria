Despite government’s decision to extend the lockdown in Lagos, Abuja and Ogun states by additional 14 days, the Nigerian equities market commenced trading in an upbeat yesterday, as index appreciated further by 2.32 per cent.

The upturn was largely boosted by capital appreciation recorded in the shares of the following mid and large capitalised stocks, Dangote Cement, MTN Nigeria, Stanbic IBTC Holdings, Nigerian Breweries and Guaranty Trust Bank.
