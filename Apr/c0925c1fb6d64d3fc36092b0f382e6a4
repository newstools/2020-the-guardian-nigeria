The International Institute of Islamic Therapy has urged Nigerians to disregard claims that certain herbal mixtures serve as cure for Coronavirus (COVID-19). The institute in a statement made available to journalists yesterday in Abuja, said it was unaware of any clinically proven remedy to cure COVID-19, adding that Nigerians should not be fooled by the ‘miracle’ treatments some people are trying to sell. Following the outbreak of COVID-19 in Nigeria, the media has been awash with claims of herbal cures for the killer disease. Ooni of Ife, Enitan Adeyeye Ogunwusi (Ojaja II), had also prescribed a list of herbs he claimed had been tested to cure disease. But the institute, while saying that there is no existence of a cure for the disease, said some herbal combinations, also known as prophetic medicine, could be used to manage COVID-19 symptoms by enhancing the immune system of patients diagnosed of the disease. It however pointed that there are no records that these herbal mixtures have cured any known case, adding “because of the fear and worry caused by this virus, a lot of people have gone on social media to claim the existence of a cure for the disease and gullibility has made the wide spread of such claims rampant, even if the world health organization (WHO) has not categorically announced a cure.
 
“The Prophetic Medicine solution we proffered is not exhausted. We are in no way claiming that these herbal remedies have cured any known case; but they possess great potentials, based on our previous researches on similar ailments and symptoms. We call on members of the public to cooperate with the Ministry of Health and NCDC on the orthodox approach pursued to resolve the Nigerian share of the pandemic”.
