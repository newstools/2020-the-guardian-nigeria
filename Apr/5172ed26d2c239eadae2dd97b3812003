Joeboy stole our heart’s with his breakout single “Baby,” a romantic upbeat track that leaves one daydreaming and dancing at the same time. And just as we were soaking up the melodies, he dropped his EP titled “Love and Light”, back in 2019. Now, he is back again with a Dëra-produced new single “Call,” which also comes packed with promises of affection and an earnest follow up to “Baby”. The official video dropped Friday. In the new video, the singer puts on a cape and rushes to rescue a damsel in distress as a fearsome-looking storm appears on the verge of destroying a city. The woman seems resigned to her fate while trapped inside of a school bus, but Joeboy, as expected, saves her. “Call” is said to appear on Joeboy’s currently untitled upcoming debut album to be released later this year.
