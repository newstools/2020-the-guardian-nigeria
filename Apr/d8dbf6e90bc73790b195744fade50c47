Grated cheese | Oddity Pranks are meant to be hilarious but a line has to be drawn when it crosses the bounds of human decency. The students, three females students at Northwest Iowa Community College were arrested for pranking their roommate by allowing her to eat foot shavings as grated cheese. The students identified as Ann C., a nursing student and member of the All-Iowa Academic Team, Kyiah Elaine K., a 19-year-old former Honor List student, and 20-year-old Ellie T had the prank on March 13 but only got arrested last week. It is not certain how the pranked student found out about the foot skin shavings being mixed with her bag of grated cheese. It is also unclear who came up with the disgusting idea but the three have been charged with assault. Reacting to the incident, Kristin Kollbaum, a spokesperson for the college, told VICE Magazine. “We hold the quality of instruction and safety of our students and employees as our highest priorities. We are aware of the incident and are cooperating with the proper authorities in the investigation.” One thing is for sure, even if they manage to avoid any jail time, they are bound to have some problems at school considering the faculty at their college already know about the incident.
