Since the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) confirmed an unnamed person Saturday night as an index case for coronavirus in Imo State, residents have been gripped by palpable tension. The problem is compounded by the silence of the state government on the issue. There were unconfirmed reports that the victim works with a public health institution located within the Government House vicinity in Owerri. Efforts to reach the Commissioner for Health, Dr. Damaris Osunkwo, yesterday for comments were futile, as she neither picked nor returned the calls placed to her mobile phone. Also, Governor Hope Uzodimma was yet to address the press on the incident at the time of filing this report. His spokesman, Oguwike Nwachuku, was said to be working on the governorâ€™s pre-broadcast material billed for today.
