Andrew Jack | Image: NME British actor and dialect coach Andrew Jack, who appeared in Star Wars has died after contracting coronavirus at the age of 76. Jack who played Major (and then General) Ematt in “Star Wars: Episode VII – The Force Awakens” and “Star Wars: Episode VIII – The Last Jedi” died on Tuesday in a hospital near London. Jack’s agent, Jill McCullough, said in a statement that a funeral may not hold for the actor due to the coronavirus pandemic as Jack’s wife, also a dialect coach, Gabrielle Rogers, is in quarantine in Australia. “Tragically she is stuck in quarantine in Australia, having just flown in from New Zealand last week. She was unable to see or talk to him at the end of his life and there is a chance a funeral may not be held.” Gabrielle Rogers announced her husband’s death in an Instagram post: “It breaks my heart to let you know we lost a man today. Andrew Jack was diagnosed with Coronavirus when admitted to hospital less than 48 hours ago in suburban London. He died today. He was in no pain, and he slipped away peacefully knowing that his children, step children, grandchildren, brother, friends, and I were all “with” him. Take care out there, lovers x”. Jack had worked with over 200 actors including Robert Downey Jr. (in Richard Attenborough’s Chaplin, Michael Hoffman’s Restoration and Guy Ritchie’s Sherlock Holmes), Pierce Brosnan (in GoldenEye, Tomorrow Never Dies and Die Another Day), Cate Blanchett, and Viggo Mortensen. As supervising dialect coach for The Lord of the Rings, he created the Middle-earth accents and taught them, along with Elvish and Black Speech, to the cast of the trilogy. He designed and taught the accents for the Greeks and Trojans in Wolfgang Petersen’s Troy. He taught Evan Davis to speak with a Nottinghamshire twang. He was known for helping non-British actors to be more intelligible to the audience.
