In what could be described as perennial menace, the electricity grip which powers the entire country collapsed in the early hour of Wednesday, leaving the nation in darkness. The grid recorded over eleven system collapse last year and had collapsed earlier this before going down at about 1:21AM. The system was later restored shortly but power generation down to about 2,900 megawatts. The Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN), while confirming the development, noted that investigation was on to ascertain the reasons behind the collapse. “TCN would commence investigations into the cause of the supply loss as soon as full recovery is achieved. We are committed to ensuring grid stability and consistent bulk power supply, especially at this time of the pandemic,”the General Manager, Public Affairs at TCN, Ndidi Mbah said in a statement. She disclosed that the National Control Centre (NCC) of TCN in Osogbo had been working on fully restoring supply. The Association of Nigerian Electricity Distributors (ANED), the umbrella body of the distribution companies had last year decried the repeated system collapse, stating that TCN’s analogue system caused over 100 electricity grid collapses since the privatisation of the power sector in 2013.
