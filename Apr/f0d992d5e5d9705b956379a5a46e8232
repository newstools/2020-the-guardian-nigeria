• Extension of PSCs, tax relief for operators key for rebound in oil industry With the impact of the coronavirus compounding oil and gas industry challenges, governments in Nigeria and other African countries have been urged to extend the implementation of Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs), and work program adjustments to boost exploration and ensure the resumption of drilling activities.
 
While the immediate impact on the continent’s biggest oil & gas project is already being felt, the African Energy Chamber (AEC), stated that a much bigger impact will result from the deferral or cancelling of drilling plans.
   
Already, across oil & gas basins, drilling projects are being put back on the shelves or terminated. Final Investment Decision (FID) on Shell’s Bonga South West Aparo project in Nigeria, for which the invitation to tender was released to contractors early last year, could also not see FID this year.
   
Delays in the execution or sanctioning of these projects are expected to severely impact African economies whose local goods and services were set to benefit from billions of dollars of subcontracting opportunities.  “Our commonsense approach advocates for measures that will support the continuity of business operations and future sector growth. The oil and gas industry will only work for Africans when we set fair policies and treat oil and gas companies as partners who drive our progress,” declared NJ Ayuk, Executive Chairman at the African Energy Chamber.
   
“As the voice of the energy industry, we will continue to work with the public and the private sector and other stakeholders to revitalize the African oil and sector by putting Africans back to work,” added Ayuk.
