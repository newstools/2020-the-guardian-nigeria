The National President of the Independent Petroleum Association of Nigeria (IPMAN), Elder Chinedu Okoronkwo has directed all IPMAN members nationwide to open their filling stations for service, while giving assurnace of effective petrol distribution to customers during the lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic. This was contained in a statement signed  by the National Operations Controller of IPMAN, Mike Osatuyi, on Monday informing marketers that restriction on CONVID-19 “Stay at Home”  does not apply to food processing, distribution, retail companies and petroleum distribution and retailing petroleum stations nationwide. Osatuyi stated that President Muhammadu Buhari in his broadcast on Sunday, 29th March 2020 emphasized that petroleum distribution and retailers were not included in the restrictions. According to  Osatuyi,  “All members of the association should work with other stakeholders in the downstream sector in ensuring seamless operation in loading in both private depots and NNPC depots nationwide. “The Federal Government has assured security for our staff and members who are serving the country at this trying moment.
Osatuyi enjoined all IPMAN staff and members to wear their identification cards in case of screening on the roads and highway.He said: The National Executive Committee of IPMAN  commended members nationwide and advised them to sell petrol at N125 approved price. “IPMAN also stands with all Nigerians and the Federal Government  in this  trying period. “We commend the efforts of the Ministry of Health, Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), all state governments and Federal Government and wish to reassure them of our commitment towards effective distribution of petroleum product across the nooks and cranny of the country will not be compromised. “We appeal to Nigerians to adhered to government directives and maintain regular hygienic, sanitary practices as well as social distancing “. he said. Osatuyi commended the management of NNPC under the leadership of Mallam Mele Kyari, the Group Managing Director for assuring marketers of sufficient and prompt petroleum distribution. It would be recalled that Kyari on March 29 2020, urged Nigerians not to engage in panic buying of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), as the country has adequate stock of the products to last for over 60-days. Kyari assured that the NNPC had the support of all stakeholders to ensure adequate supply of petroleum products in the country.He said: “There is absolutely no scarcity anywhere; our supply is robust, we have fuel that will last this country even for 60-days if assuming we do not import any. “Maintain your normal life, we have secured all assurances that trucks will be moving freely across the country throughout this period of difficulty and supply will be sustained’’.He appealed to Nigerians not to flood fuel stations as there was no need for that.
