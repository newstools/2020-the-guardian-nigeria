This pandemic is too large for governments to tackle alone,” said. “We are also incredibly grateful for the continued support from the artist community to make ‘One World: Together At Home’ a moment of global unity. Our hope for the special is that everyone will come away believing that we, as a shared humanity, can emerge from this moment forever grateful for the work of doctors, nurses, teachers, grocery store workers, and all those who are the backbone of our communities.” At this critical moment in history, Global Citizen is also calling on individuals, governments, and philanthropists to join and support immediate COVID-19 response efforts. Leaders are being urged to actualize their giving and invest quickly in related efforts, like stronger health systems and vaccine development.
