Amid rising tension from the outbreak of Coronavirus pandemic and the shrinking activities across oil fields, there are indications that Nigerians may end up in darkness due to shortage of gas. The Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) had informed that the power sector has in the past weeks continued to experience power supply shortage due to serious gas constraints to most of the nation’s thermal generating stations. Earlier last month, the government owned entity in the sector had said some plants were generating zero power, particularly Sapele NIPP, Olorunsogo NIPP, Ihovbor NIPP and Azura Edo power plants as well as Egbin (Steam), Sapele, Delta, Geregu, Omotosho, Olorusogo, Geregu NIPP, Alaoji NIPP, Omotosho NIPP, Odukpani NIPP, Okpai and Omoku power generating plants. Coming at a time when consumers needed the supply the most to cushion the effects of the corona virus outbreak, TCN noted that the low gas supply to many power plants may persisted. According to the organization, the development has restrained optimal generation into the grid and consequently the quantum of electricity transmitted to distribution load centers. “The thermal power plants most affected by gas supply constraint include; Geregu Gas station now generating 0MW against 435MW, Geregu NIPP generating 81MW with a shortfall of 354MW, Sapele NIPP now generating 0MW against 230MW, Olorunsogo NIPP generating 0MW against 112MW and Olorunsogo Gas plant generating 70.5MW with a shortfall of 195.5MW while Gbarian plant is generating 0MW against 112MW. “Also affected by the gas supply constraint are; Omotosho NIPP generating 110MW with a shortfall of 220MW, Egbin generating 596MW with a short fall of 264MW, Delta II-IV gas  generating 306.81MW with a shortfall of 128.19MW and Okpai Gas plant generating 159MW with a shortfall of 291MW,” the firm’s spokesperson, Ndidi Mba stated. She added that Rivers IPP, AFAM IV-V and Paras Energy are also generating with a shortfall of 40MW, 60MW and 30.2MW respectively, noting that AFAM VI does not have gas supply problem but one of its units is out on fault. According to her Azura and Odukpani power plants are the only two thermal power generating stations generating at full capacity into the nations’ grid. “With the current situation therefore, the distribution companies that have the capacity to pick more load are unable to, as TCN strives to distribute what is generated into the grid equitably among DisCos nationwide,” Mba said.
