Nigerian Union of Journalists (NUJ) have challenged governments and private businesses to include media practitioners and other essential workers as beneficiaries of palliatives and Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) to encourage performance. This is as journalists in Bayelsa State continue to lament their non-inclusion in the activities of the state government and COVID-19 committee. Member of the NUJ Board of Trustees (BoT), John Angese, and the chairman of Bayelsa Council, Samuel Numenengi, made this known yesterday in Yenagoa during the presentation of PPE to journalists by House of Assembly member representing Kolokuma/Opokuma Constituency 2, Wisdom Fafi, at the NUJ secretariat. Agese noted that despite the risky job of journalists, police, health workers and other essential workers in the sensitisation, security and treatment of COVID-19 patients, the federal and state governments treat them as unqualified to benefit from PPE, testing and presentation of palliatives to cushion the effect of the pandemic. He called on governments and the private sector to consider the essential workers, as they leave behind families at home to safeguard the lives of many Nigerians. Numenengi noted that despite the huge role being played by journalists and other essential workers, they remained neglected and left vulnerable to contact the virus due to the absence of PPE and others. He thanked the lawmaker for presenting the face masks, sanitisers, soaps and others. Earlier, in his presentation, Fafi pointed out that his decision to reach out to journalists at these trying times was based on his conviction that the media practitioners were also critical stakeholders in the battle against COVID-19. He added, “They are at the forefront of the COVID-19 campaign. Despite that government cannot reach out to everyone at a time, the essential workers need to be motivated and encouraged.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
