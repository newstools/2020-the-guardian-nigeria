A non-governmental organization, International Center for Human Rights, Non-violence and Safety Awareness has called on the government to extend its palliatives beyond provision of foodstuffs. The NGO, in a statement signed by its Chief Executive Officer, Barr. Ene Unobe, wants house rent to be included in stimulus package.
 
It reads: “Government’s restriction of movement order, which includes the directive for citizens to stay at home in order to contain the spread of COVID-19, is in good faith. This lockdown is taking its toll on individuals and families’ efforts to meet basic obligations. As a human right NGO, we have been inundated with communications by distressed Nigerians who have started falling victims of economic problems associated with this unforeseen shutdown.  The NGO stated that to tackle these problems, there is need for government “to give directives that landlords should observe moratorium on payment of rents for at least three months starting from April 2020. As a consequence, lawsuits by landlords on recovery of premises at this time should be discouraged for the same period of time. “Contractual obligations to banks and other financial institution on loans should be relaxed. Government’s rates and taxes that directly impact on the poor and private sector should be suspended or reduced to the barest minimal for the time being as well as massive financial support for the organized private sector to enable them pay salaries of their staff and other operational costs.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
