It was not immediately clear how much Rwanda will collect through the forfeited monthly salaries of its top officials. Rwanda imposed a strict shutdown in response to the coronavirus outbreak, closing all but the most essential shops, suspending public transport and banning all “unnecessary movements” outside the home on March 21. The countries poor have been especially hard hit as food prices have risen and unemployment soared following the measures, which have been extended until April 19. The IMF last week authorised a loan to Rwanda of nearly $110 million (101 million euros) to address the pandemic’s economic fallout. Rwanda had 104 known cases of the disease as of 1030 GMT Monday, among the highest recorded numbers in East Africa.
