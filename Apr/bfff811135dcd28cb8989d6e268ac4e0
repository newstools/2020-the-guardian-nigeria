• Odigie-Oyegun, Kaigama, Uche, YUF, YWC, others condole Buhari
• President loses another aide The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) yesterday asked the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) authorities to immediately prosecute Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha and other government officials who flouted safety rules at the burial of the late Abba Kyari in Abuja. It noted that apology of Mustapha, who is also Chairman, Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 pandemic for violating safety and social restriction directives by certain government officials during Kyari’s funeral was unacceptable. In a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, it noted that the apology came after widespread condemnation of government officials and other individuals’ conduct at the funeral, insisting that they should be sanctioned in line with its actions against ordinary Nigerians who had flouted the safety and social restriction orders. However, former National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief John Odigie-Oyegun expressed grief over the death of Kyari, who was until his passing Chief of Staff (COS) to President Muhammadu Buhari. Odigie-Oyegun in a condolence letter addressed to President Buhari said, “His death came to me as a shock as I was sure he was receiving the best medical care available. “However, as a people of faith, we cannot question the will of God. I can imagine how much you must be feeling, but God will console you, his family and the people of Borno State and fill the obvious void his absence has created.” In a similar vein, the Catholic Archbishop of Abuja, Most Rev. Ignatius Kaigama and the Prelate, Methodist Church, Nigeria, His Eminence, Samuel Uche, have commiserated with President Buhari on the death of Kyari. In a letter to the presidency on behalf of the priests and all faithful of the Catholic Archdiocese of Abuja, Kaigama also extended heartfelt condolences to the families and relations of Nigerians who have lost their lives to the coronavirus pandemic On his part, Uche prayed God to console the President and family of the deceased. Also, pioneer National Chairman of APC, Chief Bisi Akande, presidential candidate in the June 12, 1993 election, Alhaji Bashir Tofa, former Senate President, Adolphus Wabara, President, Nigeria Olympic Committee, Habu Gumel and the Soun of Ogbomosho, Oba Oladunni Ajagungbade III, commiserated with the President. Besides, the Yoruba Unity Forum (YUF) has commiserated with President Buhari, the Federal Executive Council (FEC), the entire country on Kyari’s demise and prayed God to grant his family the fortitude to bear the loss. In a condolence letter jointly signed by its Chairman, Archbishop Ayo Ladigbolu and Secretary General, Anthony Adefuye, the group charged Nigerians to uphold and diligently embrace Kyari’s strides to make Nigeria an enviable pride among the comity of nations, especially in the areas of hard work and transparency. Meanwhile, the Yoruba World Congress (YWC) has said the late Kyari hijacked government from constitutional structures, stressing that Nigeria was being operated like a ‘Banana Republic’, while demanding immediate end to such leadership style in the country.   President-General of YWC, Professor Banji Akintoye, said a country in which administrative structures depended on the whims and caprices of government officials was outrageous and unacceptable. He insisted that Nigeria was a constitutional republic in which the structures of governance were clearly laid down by the constitution. Still smarting from the death of the COS, one of President Buhari’s bodyguards, Lawal Mato died yesterday after battling diabetes for three years. The President described Mato, who had been working with him for many years before he won the 2015 elections, as “a very thorough, trustworthy and dependable soldier, who carried out his duties with diligence and focus.” In a statement issued by Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, the President prayed that Allah will ease his (Mato’s) passage to paradise and grant his family, government and people of Jigawa State the fortitude to bear the loss.
