Brooke-Taylor who was best known as a member of The Goodies died early Sunday from the virus according to his agent, per Variety. Goodies co-star Graeme Garden said Brooke-Taylor was “a funny, sociable, generous man who was a delight to work with. Audiences found him not only hilarious but also adorable.” Brooke-Taylor was part of Cambridge University’s Footlights revue, the breeding ground of several generations of British comic talent. He broke into radio and television comedy in the 1960s alongside future Monty Python members John Cleese and Graham Chapman. Brooke-Taylor went on to form The Goodies with Graeme Garden and Bill Oddie. The trio specialized in slightly surreal sketches incorporating visual inventiveness, slapstick and songs. Their song “Funky Gibbon” even became a U.K. top 10 chart hit in 1975. Their TV show, which ran throughout the 1970s, was a hit in Britain, Australia and New Zealand and developed a cult following in many other countries. “The Goodies” formed part of a golden era of British television comedy in the 1960s and 70s that included “Monty Python’s Flying Circus” and “Not the Nine O’Clock News.” Brooke-Taylor recently co-hosted Channel 4 daytime game show “Beat The Nation” with Graeme Garden. His final TV credit was an episode of BBC One medical soap “Doctors” in 2015. Brooke-Taylor was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) during the Queen’s 2011 Birthday Honors, for services to entertainment. Brooke-Taylor is survived by wife Christine Weadon and their two sons Ben and Edward.
