Ekiti CP tasks police, others on respect for human rights The People’s Democratic Party (PDP) has warned that the economic crisis that may occur as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic may be worse than the effects of the virus. Chairman, PDP Lagos Chapter, Deji Doherty, said it’s quite apparent that the present government, headed by the All Progressives Congress (APC) was not working on all fronts and unproactive in their planning during this COVID-19 crisis.
 
Doherty said: “However, we must put away our partisan differences and work, think and speak in the interest of all Lagosians and Nigerians at large. I believe it is time to call on the Central Bank Governor, the Minister of Finance, the Presidential Economic Advisory Team and of course the bankers’ committee to urgently look into how economic stability can be achieved.”  Amba, who applauded the residents for complying with the extension of the lockdown, said the strict adherence had reduced the level of arrests, contrary to what was witnessed in the first 14 days. The CP, who spoke through the Command’s Public Relations Officer, Mr. Sunday Abutu, yesterday, said that he had been moving round the state since the extension to ensure that no citizen was molested by any security agent.
