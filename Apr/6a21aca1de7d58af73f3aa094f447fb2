Residents of Ifo, Sango, Agbado and neighbouring communities in Ogun State, have lamented rising criminal activities occasioned by the lockdown in the state. In the last six days, The Guardian learnt that the robbers, mainly young persons, dispossessed residents of cash, phones, foodstuff and other belongings, in the daytime and at night, leaving residents with tales of woe. Though the state Police Command issued a statement on Friday, on the arrest of 18 members of the gang, The Guardian learnt that same day, other members of the gang unleashed terror on Adiyan, Ijako, Agbado, Alakuko, Daleko and other areas, where one person was reportedly killed.  A victim, who resides in Ayede, but pleaded anonymity, described the scenario, as double terror. “Coro by day and robbers by night.” He revealed that for four days, residents had been having sleepless nights. “Though the Police appear alert by raiding black spots, thereby arresting criminals, but these hoodlums still unleash terror on residents.” Similarly, residents of Meiran, Alimosho Local Council of Lagos State have appealed to the State Police Command to speed up investigation that would lead to the arrest of armed robbers, who attacked the community. They lamented that the on-going lockdown, as a result of COVID-19 pandemic, has created more danger to lives and properties, rather than a blessing, as armed robbers now terrorise residents unhindered.
 
Speaking on behalf of residents, Chairman, Lagos State Branch, Nigerian Institute of Town Planners, Adebisi Adedire alleged that the Police showed up after the robbers left, carting away personal belongings and money.
