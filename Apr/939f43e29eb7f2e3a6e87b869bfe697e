The tests came back with negative results,” the club said in a statement. “The players have, therefore, recovered and are no longer subjected to the home isolation regime.” Juventus forward Paulo Dybala documented how he “struggled to breathe” after coming down with the virus on March 21, although the club did not provide an update on the Argentine.
