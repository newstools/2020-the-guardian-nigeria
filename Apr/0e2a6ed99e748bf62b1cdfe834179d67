Pastor Joel Osteen of Lakewood church will be having a special Easter Sunday service with a few of his celebrity friends, virtually. The 57-year-old who has been delivering his sermons online since March has invited Mariah Carey, Tyler Perry, and Kanye West, along with the rapper’s Sunday Service choir, to each take over a segment of the Lakewood Church, live feed. “It just all came together,” says Osteen. “It just kind of fell into place.” “I had known Mariah from years past,” the televangelist said during a chat with news outlet TMZ, explaining that Carey had summoned him to help her “do her part to bring hope and uplift the nation,” by putting together a tribute to health-care workers and first responders on the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic. On why he included Perry to his guest list, Osteen said his congregation will be thrilled to see his longtime friend back again. “He’s a very powerful speaker,” he says. “People at Lakewood love him.” L-R; Mariah Carey, Tyler Perry | Photo: New York Post The preacher also admits that he’s “not sure exactly what [West is] going to do” with his airtime, but this isn’t the first time the pair have worshipped together. They teamed up last year in November at the reverend’s 16,800-seat auditorium in Houston, and then again earlier this year for an event at Yankee Stadium hosted by the Osteen and his wife Victoria, that time with Ye’s choir. Everyone involved will be practicing social distancing. How a mega choir will pull that off is yet to be seen. “Kanye’s one of a kind,” he added. “He’ll figure out some way to do it.”
