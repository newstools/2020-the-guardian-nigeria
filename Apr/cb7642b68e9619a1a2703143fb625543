Kano state continued to witness a steady upsurge of positive cases of COVID-19 pandemic with the latest figure standing at 73, according to the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control. Overwhelmed by the rising cases of the virus and burden of curtailing its spread, Governor Abdullahi Ganduje has solicited Federal Government financial support. The governor made the call when he received the director-general of Nigerian Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) Dr Chikwe Ihekweazu at Government House. The NCDC boss was in Kano as part of a national tour to access the level of preparedness in the fight against the disease. Ganduje said based on population size, Kano state requires more support at this point than Lagos state, stressing already dispensed resources to curtail the burden. While describing how much the state has done so far, he mentioned the basic challenge was lack of sufficient funds and called on the federal government to assist Kano. Meanwhile, a senior medical doctor who is working under the taskforce regretted that health workers are more exposed to the virus. Other doctors lamented inadequate provision of basic amenities and facility to efficiently manage the pandemic. Already the Nigeria Medical Association (NMA) Kano chapter has directed doctors in the state to consider their safety first while attempting to render clinical services.
