Toyin Abraham | everyEvery NG Yesterday, there were speculation that Nollywood actress Toyin Abraham has replaced fellow actress Funke Akindele in the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control’s (NCDC) fight against coronavirus. This was coming after a campaign by the NCDC featured Abraham in which she educates the public on how to protect themselves and prevent the spread of COVID-19. In the video, Abraham employs the use of Yoruba language to enlighten the public. Abraham has taken to social media to shut down rumours that she replaced Akindele following the emergence of the campaign. According to the “Alakada” star, this is not a case of taking advantage of a bad situation but rather campaigning against a pandemic. She wrote: “It has just been brought to my attention that blogs are reporting that I am now NCDC ambassador. Implying that I have been used to replace a colleague. That line of thought necessitate I put this out there. I am not an ambassador to NCDC. I do not like the narrative that I am trying to take advantage of a bad situation. I support the campaign against Covid-19, I appeared on a video campaign against the pandemic but please let’s not drag another person down. Thank you.” <img class="aligncenter wp-image-1144080 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Funke-Akindele-and-JJC-Skillz-1.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Funke-Akindele-and-JJC-Skillz-1.jpeg 775w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Funke-Akindele-and-JJC-Skillz-1-640x360.jpeg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Funke-Akindele-and-JJC-Skillz-1-320x180.jpeg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Funke-Akindele-and-JJC-Skillz-1-281x158.jpeg 281w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Funke-Akindele-and-JJC-Skillz-1-562x316.jpeg 562w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Funke-Akindele-and-JJC-Skillz-1-531x299.jpeg 531w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Funke-Akindele-and-JJC-Skillz-1-1062x598.jpeg 1062w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Funke-Akindele-and-JJC-Skillz-1-487x274.jpeg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Funke-Akindele-and-JJC-Skillz-1-600x338.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> Akindele was last month arrested and arraigned in court alongside her husband Abdulrasheed Bello a.k.a JJC. The couple violated the federal government’s ban on social gatherings in light of the coronavirus outbreak. Prior to the party, Akindele had appeared in a campaign by Dettol in conjunction with the NCDC to educate Nigerians on how to protect themselves and stop the spread of coronavirus. Following this incident, Dettol Nigeria released an official statement via its Twitter page, noting that it “does not condone any breach of the guidelines on Covid-19.” The NCDC in its response quoted Dettol Nigeria’s tweet and stated that it has not engaged brand ambassadors as part of its approach against coronavirus. Akindele was arraigned in court along with her husband, JJC Skillz and other attendees of the occasion. She was sentenced to 14-day community service along with a 100,000 Naira fine.
