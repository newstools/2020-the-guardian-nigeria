Senate President Ahmad Lawan has admonished Christians and other Nigerians to learn from the death of Jesus Christ on the cross at Calvary and his resurrection as a sure hope of victory over the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and all other trials that test their faith. Lawan stated in Abuja yesterday that “Easter marks the triumph of Jesus Christ” over sin, adversity and death. His words, “This occasion is relevant today more than ever before as mankind passes through one of the darkest clouds in history. “My belief is that this is a phase for Nigeria and the entire world, and that our faith is a potent spiritual weapon for the pursuit of victory. Therefore, let us be fervent in our prayer for divine intervention to vanquish the pandemic, heal the sick and renew the world and Nigeria. “We should not allow the frightening reports from other parts of the world on the pandemic to discourage us or weaken our hope. Rather, such reports should remind us of the divine mercy under which we live in this clime, and strengthen our determination to rout this virus and others.” He lauded Nigerians for their resilience, urging them to continue to cooperate with the government in the fight against coronavirus and its deleterious effect on the economy and life in general. According to him, the National Assembly will continue to provide legislative intervention to support and improve the efforts of government in this trying period and beyond. The number three citizen commended the health personnel and other stakeholders at the frontline of the battle against the pandemic. In the same vein, he applauded the public-spirited individuals, corporate bodies, institutions and others who have risen in sacrifice and support for the nation in the COVID-19 battle. Felicitating with Nigerian Christians as they celebrate Easter, a very important event in Christian calendar, he urged everyone to strictly observe the public health protocols of social distancing, regular washing of hands and the rules of hygiene in their homes as they mark the joyous occasion.
