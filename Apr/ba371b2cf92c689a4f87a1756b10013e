I been shot at, stabbed, fought, n**gas suing me. Today I read on the internet they said I lost seven million. Sh*t, what Imma do now? Is Popeyes hiring?! Seven million, he must be broke! In this mothaf**kin Burberry tracksuit? Who give a f**k about that. F**k a b**ch that’s suing.” A check on Priscilla Rainey’s Instagram page revealed that the Game has not paid the money. Rainey posted a picture in which she held some bundles of cash against the dashboard of a Porsche car to which someone commented that it was the Game’s money, however, in her response, Rainey said she “didn’t get a penny from that molester”.
