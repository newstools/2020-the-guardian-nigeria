The Supreme Head, Cherubim and Seraphim (C & S) Unification Church of Nigeria, His Most Eminence, Prophet Solomon Adegboyega Alao has called on religious leaders to provide palliatives to vulnerable persons in the society, as the effect of lockdown is biting hard in some states. He also called on the government to be more transparent in the distribution of palliatives to Nigerians and expand the scheme to accommodate more people. The clergyman, in his goodwill message, to celebrate this year’s Easter, also urged Nigerian leaders to emulate Jesus Christ, who sacrificed Himself for the redemption of humankind. He said the world would have been a better place, if leaders had led by example and were ready to make sacrifices, especially at this period, when the whole world is on trial. Alao said: “Jesus Christ has shown us the way. Leaders must show love and be ready to sacrifice their comforts to make the country better. These are perilous times and we must pray fervently to God to heal our land and end COVID-19 pandemic.” He also called on religious leaders not to turn deaf ears to their members’ welfare at this period, because of lockdown in many states that have brought hunger into many homes.
