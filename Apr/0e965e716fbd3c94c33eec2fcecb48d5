The National Hajj Commission of Nigeria (NAHCON) has urged Muslims to use the Ramadan period to pray for Nigeria as the country tackles the COVID-19 scourge. In his Ramadan message to Muslims yesterday in Abuja, Chairman of the Commission, Alhaji Zikrullah Kunle Hassan, stated that prayer was necessary at this period when the Covid-19 pandemic has demoralised the world, with a lockdown that is hindering people from performing their legitimate duties to earn their livelihood. The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) also made a similar appeal yesterday, urging Muslims to use the period of the Ramadan to pray fervently for the nation as well as instill self-restraint on the faithful as commanded by Holy Prophet Mohammad. Hassan urged Nigerians to adhere strictly to directives of the Presidential Committee on COVID-19 on social distancing and personal hygiene in order to stave off the spread of the virus. He further Muslims to always respect constituted authorities, saying it is a key principle of Islam. The NAHCON chair stated: “As a Muslim, I cannot think of a better idea than to call on the Muslim Ummah to use this occasion to pray conscientiously to the Almighty Allah to protect us from this calamity and terminate the pandemic, for the world to return to its normal activities. “Similarly, the sublime month of Ramadan is a period of retreat; retreat from worldly treats to spiritual sobriety; a retreat from selfishness to sharing and caring. “Ramadan is a time of showing appreciation to the Almighty and to fellow humans who must have impacted in one’s life one way or the other. Although we do this every other day, however, the special occasion inspires us to do more.” The PDP, on its part, said the Holy month of Ramadan presents a divine opportunity to mankind and Nigerians in particular, to draw near to the Almighty Allah in supplication to bring solution to the challenges of life, especially the deadly COVID-19 pandemic. The PDP, in a statement by its national publicity secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, noted that the coming of Ramadan at this trying time was yet another divine signal of Allah’s love and mercy to deliver mankind from tribulations. “Our party therefore urges all compatriots to set aside every primordial difference and unite as one people in sober reflection, prayers and support to one another in this quest to defeat the pandemic.” It is also instructive that we all use the holy month to rekindle our spirit of brotherliness by redoubling our efforts in reaching out, supporting and caring for one another, particularly the vulnerable and the downtrodden,” the PDP stressed. The party also called on Nigerians to continue to observe all the safety directives of social distancing and personal hygiene in the overall effort to defeat the plague and restore normalcy in the country.The party prayed for a peaceful and successful Ramadan as well as divine solution to Nigeria’s challenges.
