After months of speculations that he had been lined up to take over the Super Eagles job, Harry Redknapp yesterday laughed off such claims. The former Tottenham and Portsmouth manager was rumoured to have been lined up by Nigeria’s Sports Ministry to replace Gernot Rohr. However, on Tuesday, the Nigerian Football Federation (NFF) confirmed that Rohr had reached an agreement to continue in his role in charge of the Super Eagles.
Addressing the claims on talkSPORT, Redknapp joked: “Yeah, well, I spoke to Sandra and she’s always wanted to live in Nigeria. “She said it’s amazing that this has come up now, because that was her dream. So we’re looking to sell up, we’re putting the house on the market. We’re looking to get somewhere over there if possible. I’m sure, she’d love it there. I’ve told her, she’d absolutely love it. I’m ready to go!’ The 73-year-old, who has not managed since a brief stint at Birmingham in 2017, added: “I actually went there a few years ago with Portsmouth, we played Manchester United, but I don’t think I’ll really be going back.’ Rohr’s deal was due to expire in June but that has now been extended. The NFF have described the rumours linking Redknapp to the job as ‘a hoax,’ according to Goal.
A source reportedly told them that if they were looking to hire a new manager that Redknapp would not have been considered. As well as Tottenham and Portsmouth, the English boss has also managed Southampton, West Ham, Bournemouth and Queens Park Rangers during his career.
