President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan PHOTO: Twitter To curtail the spread of the Coronavirus disease, President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, has harped on the need for security agencies to ensure a total enforcement of the Federal Government’s ban on interstate travels. Lawan spoke in his remarks sequel to the consideration of a motion on the “Need to enforce Presidential Order banning Interstate Movement”, sponsored by Senator Ike Ekweremadu (PDP- Enugu West). “There is need for total enforcement on the ban on interstate travels. Apparently, there is so much breach, and it appears like our security agencies who are supposed to enforce this, in most cases appear to look helpless. They need to sit up,” Lawan said. “This is a very serious health challenge to our country, but beyond interstate, even the observance of social distancing, hygiene and other protocols sometimes suffer inside the states. “I think it is very important that citizens do this because it is for our sake. Government cannot be without citizens, and it is important at this point that we do this for our sake and that of our family members,” the Senate President appealed.
