Photo: busybuddiesng.com  Super Falcons striker, Desire Oparanozie, is worried over the long delay in appointing a coach for the senior women national football team since Swede, Thomas Dennerby, left the job.  Dennerby parted ways with the NFF shortly after leading the Falcons to France 2019 FIFA Women’s World Cup. Oparanozie said in Lagos that the situation was capable of halting the Super Falcons’ progression, adding that much attention needed to be given to the team. She argued that the decision on a new Falcons’ coach should not be gender based, adding that the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) should only focus on getting a quality tactician to manage the Super Falcons. “The French women national team worked very hard under a conducive atmosphere to get to where they are now. For Super Falcons to get it right, the administrative aspect has to be okay, but the team does not have all the time in the world considering the level of competition we are getting from other African countries now.” Like the players of the U.S women national team, Oparanozie believes the time is ripe for the Super Falcons to get the same type of treatment in bonuses and camping arrangement like their male counterparts. She said: “The federation should pay Super Falcons’ allowances and bonuses in line with the girls’ output and honour they bring to the country.” Explaining her decision to leave French team, Guingamp FC, when her contract expired, Oparanozie said she wanted to explore other options in football. “My contract with my French club ends in June, so I decided not to renew it because I needed to explore other avenues. Some clubs want me to join them, but I have not taken any decision. “If there is need to come back to Nigeria to play in the women’s league, I will play. Nigeria’s league is tough and competitive, but the only issue is inadequate facilities. I started my football career in Nigerian league, so coming back home will not be a big deal for me.” She reiterated her desire to continue to play for the Super Falcons, adding, however, that the decision would rest on whoever becomes the team’s coach.
