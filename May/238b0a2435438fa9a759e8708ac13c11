He unveiled new measures including a nationwide night-time curfew, mandatory wearing of facemasks and a ban on non-essential travel between different regions.

Alao said what is expected of government at this moment is to intensify synergy among various health agencies to prevent community infection. He said it was obvious that the government does not have the capacity to provide palliatives to the majority of vulnerable Nigerians, which would have sustained further extension of the stay-at-home order, but the country should not cut off its nose to spite its face. The clergyman disagreed with government on reopening of the formal sector, which he said would encourage people to go out and continue with their normal lifestyle despite the pandemic. He said the decision to ease the lockdown seems hasty, and that but the government must be ready to educate people more on the need to use facemasks and sanction offenders.
