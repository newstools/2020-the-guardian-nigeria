Suspected assassins, on Thursday, shot dead the son of a retired Army General and one-time military administrator (Milad) of Ondo State, Brig-Gen. Opaleye (rtd). The deceased, identified as one Muyiwa Babafumilayo Opaleye, was shot dead at a popular drinking joint on Adekunle Kuye Street in Surulere, Lagos. It was learnt that the gunmen, about four in number, shot Muyiwa dead at a close rang before bolting away. One of the deceased’s friends, identified as Kunle, who tried to rush him to the hospital, was arrested and taken to Soloki Police Station. It was learnt that all efforts made at convincing the Police that the deceased was his friend fell on deft ears. It was also gathered that Kunle was interrogated and made to write a statement, while Muyiwa’s body was taken to a morgue. “Unfortunately, Kunle who made spirited efforts to save his friend, was clamped into detention, while the case was transferred to the State Criminal Intelligence and Investigation Department (SCIID) in Panti, Yaba for further investigation,” one Fatai, who claimed to have witnessed the shooting, said. It was also gathered that Opa, as Muyiwa was popularly called, the last born in the family, was working with a sporting outfit called City Sports and lived at Ajose Adeogun Street in Victoria Island. He reportedly frequented Surulere, where he has a lot of friends and admirers, and his killing elicited a lot of sympathy and emotions from his Facebook friends, who lamented his demise in words, such as ‘unbelievable,’ ‘so sad,’ ‘a sad loss,’ etc. Police sources said crack homicide detectives at the SCIID have swung into action upon receiving matching orders from the Lagos State Police boss, Hakeem Odumosu, who was said to have given them 48 hours to unravel the mystery surrounding the dastardly act and arrest the perpetrators.
