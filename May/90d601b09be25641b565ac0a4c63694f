Former Governor Adebayo Alao-Akala of Oyo State yesterday faulted the decision of the South-West governors (excluding Lagos State) in appointing retired military officers as director-generals of Amotekun Corps in their various states, stressing that the step would hamper the success of the outfit. Alao-Akala, who maintained the essence of launching Amotekun Corps was to complement internal security in the South-West states, said that military officers were not specially trained on internal security management but trained to fight wars. While speaking about his memoir titled, ‘Amazing Grace’ billed for launch in June as part of activities slated for his 70th birthday, Alao-Akala said the appointment of a police officer would have been more appropriate for the security outfit than a former soldier. According to him, the appointment of retired army officers as director-generals of Amotekun in the South-West states may stall the integrity and the effectiveness of the outfit. The Ogbomoso-born politician, who was an Assistant Commissioner of Police, said: “The Amotekun Corp will fail in the South-West states except Lagos.
“You cannot expect a soldier to head Amotekun successfully. A police officer is trained specially on internal security management. “If a retired senior police officer is appointed as the head of the Amotekun outfit in a state, the commissioner of police in the state would respect him as his former superior. A retired army officer would want to be forceful in his approach. Remember that only the police can prosecute criminals, Amotekun cannot, so, they need the co-operation of the police. “The Amotekun personnel are not armed. They will be successful if they collaborate with the police by calling for support while trying to burst crimes in their respective states and localities.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
