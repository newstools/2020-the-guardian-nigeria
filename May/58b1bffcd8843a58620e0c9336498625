Imo State Governor, Hope Uzodinma, has pledged to operate the ‘best managed sports through the State’s Sports Commission.” Speaking in Owerri on Tuesday through his deputy, Prof. Placid Njoku when he received the Dr. Patrick Ekeji-led report on sports development at the Government House, Owerri, Uzodinma promised Imo people and lovers of sports that the report would be studied, internalized and implemented. The governor hailed the committee on review of the Imo State Sports Commission for carrying out a painstaking job despite the Coronavirus disease (COVID -19) pandemic distraction. “We appreciate you for the dispassionate way you went about this assignment, despite the COVID-19 distraction. I want to promise that the state government will study the report and take appropriate action to ensure that Imo State has the best managed Sports Commission in Nigeria,” he said. According to the governor, the review of the relevant laws was necessary in order to accommodate numerous modern changes in the sports administration that needed to be taken care of and incorporated. He noted that the state’s Sports Commission was a very important agency of the government, providing an enabling environment for the stakeholders in the sports industry at all levels. Presenting the report, Ekeji recalled that the committee, which was inaugurated on March 16, commenced physical sittings before it went into online meetings due to the pandemic.
He disclosed that recommendations were made by the committee to amend some existing laws guiding the commission, hoping that it would bring about changes in the sector.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
