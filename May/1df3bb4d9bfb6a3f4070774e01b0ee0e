•  Donates Facemasks, Sanitisers As citizens of Lagos State return to work tomorrow after about five weeks of lockdown to contain the spread of Coronavirus pandemic, a law firm based in the state, SimmonCooper Partners, has called for more caution and the need for people to adhere strictly to guidelines outlined by Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu. The firm, which donated facemasks and sanitisers to Lagos State government, also enjoined residents to realise “there is need to observe social distancing now that the lockdown is gradually easing off and movements allowed.” Making the presentation at the State Medical Warehouse in Lekki, the Senior Partner SimmonsCooper Partners, Mr. Dapo Akinosun, said the donation is part of his organisation’s support to assist Lagos in its fight against COVID-19. Akinosun said, “We commend the active measures the Governor has taken in the past few weeks despite the challenges on the availability of test kits and other medical equipment…” Responding, Commissioner for Transportation, Dr. Fredric Oladehinde appreciated the firm’s gesture but also appealed to residents to exercise caution and cooperate with the administration to contain spread of the pandemic. Also speaking, a lawyer, Mrs. Victoria Alonge, said the law firm believed that they have to identify with the state government to curb the pandemic, considering how coronavirus has led to death of thousands even in advanced countries with standard medical facilities.
