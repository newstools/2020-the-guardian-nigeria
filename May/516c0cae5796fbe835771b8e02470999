A 17-year-old wife in Bauchi State has said that she stabbed her husband to death over fear of first time sex. The accused, Salma Hassan, narrated this while being paraded at the police headquarters in Bauchi yesterday. She said that she had no idea of sex education and experience of marriage. The Bauchi State Commissioner of Police, Philip Maku, said Salma allegedly used a knife to commit the heinous crime and she was arrested for culpable homicide at her home in Itas-Gadau local government area of the state. He said: “On April 24 at about 9:00a.m., one Haruna Musa, male, of Itas-Gadau reported at Itas-Gadau Division, that one Salma Hassan, female, aged 17 of the same address stabbed her husband. The husband, Mohammed Mustapha, was stabbed on the chest. As a result, he sustained serious injury and was rushed to General Hospital, Itas–Gadau for treatment where he was certified dead. The suspect was arrested and has confessed to the crime. Exhibit recovered from the suspect was one knife”. While fielding questions from journalists in Hausa language, the young housewife said she didn’t know that sex was part of marital obligations, adding that she thought her late husband was trying to defile her. “I didn’t know that sex is one of the marital obligations. On that day, when he approached me for sex, I refused him because I had never been involved in it before. I thought he wanted to rape me but he got angry and was trying to force himself on me with beating. I picked up a knife to scare him away but he kept coming and I didn’t know when I stabbed him with the knife in his chest,” she narrated. She further explained that she had already given her statement to the police and did not know what would become her fate. She added that she wouldn’t have done it if she knew better about marital obligations. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
