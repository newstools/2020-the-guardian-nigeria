Tekashi 6ix9ine Instagram Live | Image: Twitter/Tumi213 Tekashi 6ix9ine has set a new record for the most views on Instagram Live when two million people tuned in to watch him rant on Friday following his release from jail last month. Tekashi broke the previous record which was held by Tory Lanez’ Quarantine Radio with Drake, which had 310,000 viewers. In the live video, Tekashi justified snitching on his former Nine Trey Bloods gang members. He didn’t have an issue with violating the perceived “street code” because the gang associates crossed the line before he did. He alleged that one of these so-called friends slept with the mother of his child while he was out on tour. He also said that his former crew tried to kidnap his mother and kill him. He also said they beat him up and stole “millions of dollars” from him. “I snitched, I ratted,” he said, “but who was I supposed to be loyal to?” “Where was the loyalty when you were caught on the wiretap trying to kill me, where was the loyalty when you were trying to kidnap my mother, where was the loyalty when you stole a million dollars from me? Where was that? So who broke it first? I get it, don’t fight fire with fire. I’m sorry, but what did I do wrong? Be loyal to n***** who f***in’ my baby mums? “Be loyal to n***** that kidnapped me, beat the s**t outta me on video and everything? I’m supposed to be loyal to that? Y’all don’t want to accept that those are true facts.” Shortly after his live stream, Tekashi bragged about his two million viewership feat on Instagram live. “Why ya think ya can compete with me? And I ratted stoopid STILL the king you mad,” he wrote.   Why ya think ya can compete with me?

He even showed off an ankle monitor in his new music video for GOOBA, which he also dropped Friday.

But in February 2019, the rapper reached a plea agreement for testifying against fellow members of the Trey Nine Gang.
