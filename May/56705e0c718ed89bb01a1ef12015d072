The palliatives included rice, beans, garri and sweet potatoes among others, which were distributed to over 1000 households in Surulere. “The need to organise such programme at this period, was borne out of the foundation’s resolve to put smiles on the faces of the less-privileged at this particular time when COVID-19 pandemic is ravaging the world…,”she said. Emovon said the programme was to ameliorate the hardship people were going through during the lockdown, adding that the programme was one of the many the group had organised in the past to fight hunger in Surulere area of Lagos. The event was financed by the Foundation’s Board of Trustees and other private individuals without any government’s intervention.
