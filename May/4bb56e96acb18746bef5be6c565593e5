The Equal by 30 Campaign has sought the commitment of the public and private sectors to work towards equal pay, equal leadership, and equal opportunities for women in the clean energy sector by 2030.
 
The ‘Equal by 30 Campaign’ is a joint initiative of the Clean Energy, Education and Empowerment Initiative (C3E), as well as the International Energy Agency (IEA), with endorsed principles and concrete action to accelerate the participation of women in the energy sector and close the gender gap in Africa.
 
The African Energy Chamber maintained that there is more urgency than ever to align political, financial, economic, and social resources to create a more equitable energy sector in Africa for all, noting that as a coalition, it cannot be done without involving women.
 
The Equal by 30 Campaign is being rolled out with the aim to advance gender equality and ensure women are firmly at the centre of the energy industry.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
