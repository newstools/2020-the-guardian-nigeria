An integrated Rice Processor in Kano, Tiamin Rice Mill yesterday accused the Kano state government of disobeying a Federal high court judgment that directed immediate re-opening of the plant. Deputy Managing Director, Tiamin Rice, Alhaji Aliyu Ibrahim told journalists yesterday that several attemptss to serve the state Attorney-General and Commissioner of Justice original copies of the judgement proved abortive owing to what he considered “a deliberate attempt to frustrate the order”. The state ministry of environment directed the immediate closure of the rice mill in April for alleged air pollution and aggravating the health of COVID-19 patients in the state. Subsequently, a Federal high court sitting in Abuja on Monday voided the decision of the state government to close the plant. Presided over by Justice Okon Abang, the court held that Kano state government violated the fundamental right of Tiamin Rice Mill, insisting no court notice was instituted against the plaintiff before the action. In suit no. FHC/ABJ/448/2020 filed by Tiamin Rice Mill Limited, Justice Abang also awarded Tiamin a sum of N300, 000 as damages for violation of right and compelled Kano Attorney General to ensure immediate compliance of the order. Tiamin Rice had joined Kano state government, Inspector General of Police and Commissioner Police in Kano in the suit. Meanwhile, Attorney General and Commission for Justice, Ibrahim Muktar had denied the existence of any court judgement directing the state government to reopen Tiamin Rice. Muktar told The Guardian that the government would not be compelled to respond to any order until it is duly served, insisting he was not aware of the original copy of the judgement. He pointed that as responsible and law-abiding people, the government will not hesitate to comply with court directives.
