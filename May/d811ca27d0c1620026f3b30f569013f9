 Image Daily Mail A teenage boy has admitted to killing his ten-year-old sister in her sleep after they argued over using a computer tablet according to the Daily Mail news. The girl, named as Luda and described by local media as smart and spirited, was hammered to death at her home in the city of Taraz, northern Kazakhstan. She was found with a broken skull and died from horrific injuries before paramedics arrived at the scene. According to the neighbours, the tragedy occurred after Luda and her brother Aleksey, 15, had a row in the courtyard near their house. A neighbour who witnessed the incident said: I heard them quarreling over a tablet and saw Aleksey carrying a hammer in his hand. The girl’s head was crushed. A part of the skull fell off when paramedics lifted up her head. Aleksey is said to be a gamer and his sister had asked for the device for studying. Aleksey attacked Luda at night in her sleep by smashing a hammer into her head multiple times. He then reportedly carried her body and dump it in the street near his neighbours’ fence. After dumping the body, Aleksey allegedly changed his clothes and alarmed his parents by telling them that ‘his sister disappeared’, according to local media. The family rushed to search for the girl and Aleksey, who ‘actively helped’, led them to the body, before his parents called authorities. Law enforcement launched a criminal case for murder against Aleksey who confessed to the crime. He faces up to 15 years in prison if found guilty. Ardak Madimarov, the head deputy of the criminal investigations department added: The hammer along with the suspect’s T-shirt and his shoes covered with the victim’s blood were discovered in the house. During interrogation, he said that he killed the girl because she pissed him off. Zhandos Mametkulov, the head deputy of a local police department further commented: The girl died from injuries not compatible with life before paramedics arrived at the scene.
