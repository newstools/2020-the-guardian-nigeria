The league reacted with consternation when Hertha Berlin player Salomon Kalou filmed himself shaking hands with teammates, flaunting the social distancing rules the clubs have put in place. Hertha has suspended Kalou, who has apologised profusely.

Germany’s regional sports ministers have already approved the Bundesliga’s plans to resume, but Stahmann said Ivory Coast international Kalou’s video left a bad impression. “Some people think the Bundesliga has lost its grip in times of a pandemic,” Stahmann added. On Monday, the former Chelsea forward was suspended by Hertha after posting a video to Facebook showing him greeting team-mates and club employees with handshakes, flaunting hygiene guidelines laid out by the league. Kalou apologised for disregarding the social distancing rules, saying: “it was a big mistake”. The 34-year-old also said he could understand how his video, shot in the dressing room, caused shockwaves as the league was seeking permission to return to action. Kalou has scored 48 goals in 151 Bundesliga games for Hertha, but is out of contract at the end of the season and could have played his last game for the club. “It was respectless and I want to apologise for that sincerely,” he added. “But I am about more than those five bad minutes that people see of me in the dressing room.” However, Kalou’s video drew criticism from the top of the German government. Health Minister Jens Spahn said it was “right” that Hertha suspended Kalou and there were “consequences after the video”. Bavaria’s premier minister Markus Soeder said the league has developed an “excellent” hygiene concept but “there are individual players, as we have read, who are behaving very, very poorly”.
