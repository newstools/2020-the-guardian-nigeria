The X-Men actress has described the process a “nightmare”. While speaking with Entertainment Tonight via Zoom on Wednesday, the 53-year-old actress narrated her struggled with her two kids, Nahla, 12, and Maceo, 6, amid quarantine. “It’s a nightmare for me. It’s a nightmare,” Berry confessed to ET’s Kevin Frazier. “This is like a wash of a semester; they’re really just not learning anything and it’s hard. I have a 6-year-old, and what I learned is that when 6-year-olds see other 6-year-olds do things, then they do things. Like, they sit and they eat because there’s 25 other ones doing it. They stay at their desks and colour because there’s 25 other ones doing it. “At home, there’s not 25 other ones doing it. So, to get them to focus and realize they’re at home but yet they’re at school, it’s really been a challenge.” However, Berry admits that she enjoys spending time with her kids. “But I have enjoyed having all this extra time with them. We have been making good use of the time when they’re not in school. When I’m not cracking the whip for school, we do have a lot of family time, story time and bonding time that we don’t often get to have, so there is the silver lining.” Berry was recently trolled for letting her six-year-old son wear high heels. “That’s what you gotta do in these times! You gotta find the fun, and he’s a class clown,” she joked. “I might have to post some of the other stuff he does.” she responded to the trolls.   #Quarantine Day 12 🥴 A post shared by  Halle Berry (@halleberry) on Mar 24, 2020 at 11:38am PDT  Nahla’s father is Canadian model Gabriel Aubrey while Maceo’s father is French film actor Olivier Martinez.
