While playing, they often come in contact with dirt and germs, which could lead to skin problems if left unattended. The skin is the largest organ in the human body, whether as adults or children. Children have thinner, more delicate, and highly sensitive skin, which means more effort must be put into caring for their skin.
As a parent, it is essential to know how to properly care for your child’s skin, maintaining their complexion, and reducing their risks of getting skin infections. Here are 6 beauty tips for caring for your child’s skin: Choose the Right Skincare Product
Proper care must be taken when choosing skincare products for your child. Like with adult products, you should focus on the ingredients listed at the back rather than the packaging. Because children have highly sensitive skin, using the wrong products could cause them to develop skin problems that might be difficult to treat.
As such, avoid skincare products that contain chemicals such as sulfate and parabens. Opt for sensitive children skin-friendly products that are also dye-free and perfume free, making sure to check the back of the products for its ingredients. Use Sunscreen
Direct exposure to the sun could harm your child’s skin as it can cause burns and irritation. This is why it is vital to protect your child’s skin from the harsh effect of the sun’s UV rays. Wear protective clothing for your kids and apply sunscreen on the exposed parts of their skin.
When choosing a sunscreen for your kids, opt for one with an SPF of at least 30 and protects against UVA and UVB rays. Also, avoid sunscreens with PABA as this can irritate the skin. Avoid using sunscreen for babies under six months instead keep them covered up and away from the sun. Keep their Skin Clean
For healthy-looking skin, your children need regular baths. These baths help them stay clean by removing germs and bacteria from the skin surface. Give them regular baths twice a day, making sure to use lukewarm water and mild soaps.
Teach your children to properly wash their hands with warm water and soap, making sure to rinse and dry thoroughly. They should be taught to wash their hands after playing outside, before eating and after using the bathroom. For older children, teach them to wash their face twice a day with a mild cleanser to reduce oil and prevent acne. Moisturise
Dry skin is very popular among younglings, mostly because they often forget to rub some lotion on. This is why, as a parent, one of your responsibilities is to ensure your child’s skin stays moisturised all the time.
Choose a moisturiser free from parabens, phthalates, dyes, GMOs, sulfates, and bisphenol-A. Make sure the moisturiser you use is gentle on your child’s sensitive skin and dermatologically proven to have no adverse effects on children. Apply lotion their arms, legs, and faces right after each bath to lock in moisture. Make The Drink Water 
Children often prefer sugary sodas and drinks to water. Water helps with detoxifying the body, contributing significantly to healthy-looking skin. As such, it is vital to get your kids to drink water as often as they can.
This would not only prevent dehydration but also keep their skin in prime condition. To get your children to drink more water, you should limit their choices to milk or water other than soda or add fruits into the water for more flavour. Observe Changes To Your Child’s Skin
Children’s skin tends to change ever so often so you should keep an eye out for these changes. Be watchful for moles, rashes, or skin colour changes making sure to consult your doctor once these changes seem out of control. Final Note
Like with adults, skincare is also important for healthy glowing skin among children. Take time out to care for your children’s skin as their bodies grow and change to keep it in prime condition. Also, remember that it is never too early to teach your children how to care for their skin.
