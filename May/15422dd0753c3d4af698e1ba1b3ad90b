Beneficiaries collecting free food at the event To ease the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic and the partial lockdown, Bukka Hut Restaurant, for two days, fed no fewer than 1,100 persons in Lagos. Tagged Food Drive, the eatery targeted residents of Surulere, including Bode Thomas, Shitta, Akerele Extension among others on the first day. Second day was in areas like Jakande, Oniru, Ologolo and Ikate. The restaurant also donated meals to two orphanage homes in its target communities. Commenting on the project, the Managing Director/Co-founder of Bukka Hut, Mr. Rasheed Jaiyeola, said: “The Food Drive is a necessity because of the level of hunger pervading our communities during this period many people have been stripped off their livelihood and have no means of feeding, hence, the need to feed those in need.” Jaiyeola also said members of the team, who participated in the outreach, ensured strict compliance with social distancing and other preventive measures while also sensitising beneficiaries on exercising same. The restaurant, which recently shut its 10 outlets in Lagos to safeguard against the spread of the virus and also protect its workers and customers, has reopened a limited number of outlets to the public. The company announced that seven of its 10 outlets would be reopened to the public. “Prompt food delivery has always been a part of our business and we have strengthened it to ensure that we meet the needs of both our existing and new customers during this period as we begin a phased opening of our restaurants. We have also sensitised and enlightened our personnel on contactless service as well as social distancing,” Jaiyeola said.
