Elton John Elton John has been forced to lay off long-serving bandmates and a number of household staff after suffering losses of tens of millions of pounds due to the coronavirus pandemic. He reportedly lost £60 million as a result after being forced to cancel or postpone 34 of his US dates for the farewell tour, which is to be his last before retirement according to The Mirror. The people who were laid off include his guitarist Davey Johnstone and drummer Nigel ­Olsson. The sacked staff will be back when it becomes clear that concerts scheduled for later this year will take place. Also, according to a source of The Mirror: The tour was forecast to makeover £60million this year. That revenue has literally disappeared overnight. Nobody expected this. The postponement of his concert was announced on his twitter account in April where he tweeted: It is with deep regret that Elton John must postpone the remainder of his upcoming North American 2020 dates on his Farewell Yellow Brick Road tour from May 22 through July 8. Previously postponed performances were from March 26 through May 2, 2020. This tough decision has been made with the continued safety and well-being of his fans at a time when health services are under increased pressure.
