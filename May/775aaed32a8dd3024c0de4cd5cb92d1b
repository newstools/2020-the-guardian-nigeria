Following the recent resolution by the Northern Governors’ Forum to return all Alimajarai students to their states, Kebbi State Government, yesterday, received another batch of 61 Alimajarai students from Kano State. Receiving the 61 repatriated students at the IDP Camp in Kalgo Local Council, Governor Atiku Bagudu Abubakar said the decision was to reduce street begging and curtail COVID-19 spread across Nigeria. According to him, the children were tested to be COVID-19 free by Kano government, while those positive were left at Kano to receive treatment and would be repatriated after treatment. “These children are from Maiyama, Jega, Argungu, Dandi, Suru, Bagudo and Kalgo Local Councils respectively, and would be handed over to the council chairmen to reunite them with their various families for the continuation of their education,” he said. He said proper identities would be ascertained and those whose proper identifies could not be immediately ascertained would be taken to the various government orphanages. Earlier, the Commissioner for Basic and Secondary Education, Alhaji Muhammadu Magawata Aliero told the Almajirai that since the Kano State Government announced the decision to return them to Kebbi, Governor Bagudu had expressed concern about their welfare till they arrived the state. The Chairman, Task Force on COVID-19, who is also the state Commissioner for Health, Alhaji Jafar Muhammed, handed over the children to the chairmen of the seven local councils the children came from for onward delivery to their parents.
