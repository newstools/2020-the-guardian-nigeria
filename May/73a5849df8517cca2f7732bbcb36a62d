The provincial government has announced the voluntary reopening of primary schools and nurseries next week after weeks of closure, in a decision that has divided parents. Trudeau’s three children are attending a French-speaking school — which remains closed — in Ontario province. But quizzed by public broadcaster Radio-Canada on Sunday, he said he was unsure whether he would be willing to let them return to class if they were enrolled in adjacent Quebec. “It’s going to be an extremely personal decision for all parents,” he said. The prime minister said he would make a decision on allowing his children to go back to school “probably at the last minute”, after considering class sizes and teacher attitudes. Trudeau has been in self-isolation with his family in their official home of Rideau Cottage in Ottowa, Ontario, after his wife Sophie Gregoire was infected with the virus in March.
