The Lagos Central Senatorial candidate under the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) during last general elections, Chief Adesunbo Onitiri, has cautioned Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu to be wary of financial dealings with China, especially in the area of loan, describing it as a booby-trap into economic slavery. In a statement, yesterday, Onitiri said there was no free lunch anywhere in the world, hence, the loans brandished by the Chinese may be a trap to drag the state into everlasting slavery. “Please, beware of soft loans written in fine prints and Chinese languages. There may be hidden dastardly state clauses to entrap the state. The Chinese don’t love Africans. They only love our natural God-given resources, which they are desperately after. “They want to buy out our ports and land. This is why they are presently buying every available land,” he alleged. He implored the State Assembly to re-enact a law forbidding foreigners from owning land and property in Lagos State. “There should be a clause in the contracts to ensure high quality works. Every contract in fine prints and Chinese language should be reviewed. We are just coming out of the bondage of colonial slavery. Don’t let us enter into Chinese slavery. “This will surely be a disaster and grave calamity. Their slavery will be worse than that of the British. The Chinese are out to enslave Africans.” Onitiri urged the government to look into every company set up by Chinese to ensure they strictly adhere to labour laws. “The government should also revoke their mining licences. Review all permissions given to them to set up companies in Nigeria to ensure they keep to our laws,” Onitiri added.
