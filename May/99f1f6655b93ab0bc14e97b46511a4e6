Kano State government has described the viral footage on the social media on Dangote Isolation entre at Sani Abacha Stadium as misleading. The video showed an isolation centre at the stadium unfinished. The person who shot the video claimed the project was abandoned. But a statement released by Commissioner for Information, Mohammad Garba, insisted that the content of the video was mischievous and misrepresentation of facts on the ongoing installation works at Sani Abacha Isolation Centre. “Whoever is behind the filming does so to deliberately distort the datum considering that even in the clip, it shows that the project is still ongoing but calculatedly moves away from filming the exercise just to accomplish the task of garbling the fact,” Garba said. Garba said the Sani Abacha Isolation Centre, which was initially billed to accommodate 500 beds, was later redesigned based on recommendation and standards set by the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 (PTF) and the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). He said while the project was reviewed and installation works continue, 218 out of the 500 beds planned for the centre were deployed to other new centres as follows: renovated Abubakar Imam Urology 77 beds; Daula Isolation Centre 10 beds; Karfi Sports Institute 213 beds, while 213 beds are retained at Sani Abacha Isolation Centre. The commissioner assured that the now 213-bed capacity Sani Abacha Isolation Centre as recommended by the relevant health authorities will soon be completed and put to use.
