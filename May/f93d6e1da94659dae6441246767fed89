• Experts seek investment in ethical hackers to check cyber threats Deputy Governor, Financial System Stability, Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Aishah Ahmad, has urged financial services providers to commit to sustainability in designing their business models. This will enable them to manage disruptions, and make a positive environmental and social impact in their quest to deliver value to their stakeholders.
 
According to her, banks and other financial institutions can only survive disruptions if they fully embraced sustainability principles, which have become more critical given the significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic ravaging the world.  “Production companies have to find a way to mitigate the effect of the pandemic on the oil sector, and the government needs to also keep the international airports shut to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. “There would be undue pressure on the bank customers, as the telecommunication infrastructure in the country is still where it used to be, though most businesses have gone online, and a lot of banks may not meet the capital ratio prescribed by CBN, because there were no businesses and no monies were made.”
 
Meanwhile, the Coordinator, ERSM Nigeria Programme, International Finance Corporation (IFC), Ibrahim Salau, said banks are currently faced with COVID-19 era risk, which has escalated credit risk, reputational risk, and liability risk.
 
However, he said environmental and social opportunities like access to new investor’s funds and climate finance, increased operational efficiency, cost savings, and enhanced corporate resilience are available for the banks.
 
He noted that stakeholders have become agitated and impatient, due to the pandemic pressure, and urged banks to build stakeholders trust, in order to achieve resilience. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
