Warn Abraham against mischief
Governorship aspirants under the aegis of All Progressives Congress (APC) faction, Unity Forum, in Ondo State, have insisted that the party’s primary election should be an open contest for all the senatorial districts of the state. This was contained in a statement signed and made available to journalists in Akure yesterday by nine out of the 10 aspirants in the faction who are jostling to dislodge Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu in the October 10, 2020 governorship poll. The aspirants are Olayide Adelani, Dapo Adelegan, Bukola Adetula, Jumoke Anifowose, Akin Awodeyi, Alhaji Olanrewaju Kazeem, Mr. Jimi Odimayo, Chief Olusola Oke and IfeOluwa Oyedele. A recent publication (not in The Guardian), which was allegedly sponsored by one of the aspirants, Dr. Olusegun Abraham, declared that the governorship ticket had been zoned to the North Senatorial District. But other aspirants said: “The said publication purportedly issued by one of our colleagues on behalf of the Unity Forum aspirants was done without authorisation. They, however, admitted that there was an online discussion on possible options of consensus aspirant for the Unity Forum and the need for smooth relationship among them, stressing that the contents of the publication were sponsored to purvey lies.
