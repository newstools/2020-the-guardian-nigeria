 Yvonne Jegede and Orezi [Instagram/IamYvonneJegede]  Jegede who was a guest on Generation Z’s business Instagram live show said she has been friends with Orezi for a very long time and the viral video where she was spotted hugging him was taken while welcoming him to an event. “Orezi is my friend, like good good friend. I have known Orezi way before I got married. Orezi has been a very good, a fantastic human being and we are cool. We’ve never had anything sexual and it has never crossed our minds,” she said. “I can’t speak for him, but he has never said anything like ‘girl I like you’ and I respect him for that. Now if people now see a video of him hugging me and that was at Mercy Johnson’s movie premiere and I invited him. I was the only one he knew at the movie premiere. When he said he wanted to leave, it was only polite that I see him off”, she added. Recall that her marriage to rapper turned actor, Olakunle “Abounce” Fawole hit the rocks in 2019. Jegede confirmed during an interview with Pulse that they are ‘no longer living together and have gone their separate ways’.
