Ekiti State Commissioner for Agriculture Olabode Folorunso has regained his freedom from his abductors. Commissioner for Information and Values Orientation Aare Muyiwa Olumilua in a statement said Folorunso was released “a few hours ago unhurt and has since rejoined his family.” He, however, did not disclose whether the government paid the N15 million demanded by Olabode’s abductors. “Government is grateful for the concern shown by members of the public during his period of incarceration,” Olumilua said. “Similarly, government appreciates the effort of the security agencies in securing his release as well as ensuring security of lives and properties on our roads. “Government also expresses sympathy to the family of the late Councillor, Mr Olatunji Omotosho, who was killed by the gunmen during the abduction on April 26, 2020.” Olumilua said the state governor Kayode Fayemi who is billed to receive Chief Olabode later today, said the state government is doing everything possible to rid the state of criminal elements. “Governor Fayemi urges the people of the state to remain vigilant and report any suspicious movement/activities to the law enforcement agencies or call the state emergency lines,” Olumilua said.
