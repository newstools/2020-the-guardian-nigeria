In continuation of his support for the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, the Kensington Adebukunola Adebutu Foundation (Kaaf) has donated Ambulances to four Southwest states. The ambulances presented to Oyo, Ondo, Osun and Ekiti states in Lagos yesterday, were, in addition, to support earlier made to Lagos and Ogun states. While Lagos received N300m, Ogun got N100m and Ekiti N25m. Also, 33 towns in Remo area of Ogun State, Surulere, Ajegunle, Anglican Mission, Methodist Mission, Christian Association of Nigeria, Remo Growth and Development Foundation and others were given tons of food items as stimulus packages. While making the presentation to the representatives of the state, on behalf of the foundation, a member of the Kaaf Board of Trustees, Aare Kola Oyefeso said the gesture is borne out of the foundation’s move to assist the states in curtailing the spread of COVID-19. He said: “This gesture is unsolicited. This is in addition to the support the Board Chairman, Sir Kensington Adebutu has rendered across the board. Without gainsaying, this kind of gesture from the Chairman is very rare. It is due to his passion for seeing to the end of the pandemic in the country. ..” “The ambulances are meant to assist the states in moving COVID-19 patients to isolation centres. By the time the pandemic ends, the state will continue to use it in their hospitals. It is not a one-off thing.” Oyefeso, who warned Nigerians not to take the lockdown relaxation period commencing from tomorrow as the end of the pandemic, advised that everyone must take precautionary measures to avoid contracting the disease. “Coronavirus is real. We need to be extra careful about it. The relaxation of the lockdown should not be misused. People can only die of the disease when they are careless. There is a need to take the precautionary measures very seriously,” he said. . To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
