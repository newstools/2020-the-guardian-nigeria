The President of the foundation, Adedayo Alli Esquire said: “It has come to our notice that in spite of the lockdown directives by the government, full compliance has not been adhered to, most especially in the areas of social distancing and taking extant precautionary measures. “Traders, artisans and people of various stations are moving freely without caution. Many still hold the erroneous belief that the virus is not real, others believe the virus can only be contracted by the “rich” and some are of the view that they are on the streets because they would have to survive, as there are limited provision in place for them…” Alli commended Lagos State and Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu for the proactive and efficient management of the pandemic.
