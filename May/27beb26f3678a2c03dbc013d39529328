Amid predictions that the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may trigger food shortages in Nigeria, Shareholders of FBN Holdings Plc have urged the bank to review its sectoral allocation to agriculture.
   
Specifically, the Former Secretary-General, Independence Shareholders Association, Adeleke Adebayo, said the bank’s provision for agriculture, which stood at 3.2 per cent in the 2019 financial year, needs to be reviewed to align with the current realities.
   
Adeleke, who spoke at the bank’s yearly general meeting, in Lagos, on Tuesday, also advised the bank to reduce the level of exposure in oil and gas sector in view of current oil prices and local deregulation.
   
He however applauded the bank for reduction in impairment charges as well as Non Performing Loans (NPLs), which stood at 9.9 per cent in 2019 against 24.7 per cent in 2018.  Adeduntan said the bank was a clear leader when it comes to electronic business, with large volumes of transactions in ATMs, USSD, and agency banking, among others, with about 23 per cent of the traffic on e-channels in Nigeria, controlled by the bank.
 
He Adeduntan said the bank remains the biggest lender to the agriculture sector and would continue to partner with the Central Bank of Nigeria to strengthen the sector.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
