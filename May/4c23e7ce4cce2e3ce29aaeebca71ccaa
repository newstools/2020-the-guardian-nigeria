• Urges Agency To Focus On Kano, Others The Society Committee Against COVID-19 (SOCOCOVID) has raised alarm over the alleged insistence of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) to send its employees to carry out tests in Cross River State when it is yet to record any case of Coronavirus. Speaking on Friday in Abuja, National Coordinator, SOCOCOVID, Kenneth Ibe-Kalu, advised NCDC to channel its resources to Kano State, and wondered why Nigerian government and it’s health systems that are struggling and begging other nations for medical supplies could not deploy the few testing kits available to worst-hit states that lack prevention and management of Coronavirus. Ibe-Kalu said: “Currently, in Nigeria, Kano State seems to be the COVID-19 scarecrow among Nigerians and the International community. We understand that only one testing centre is located in Kano and testing resumed a few days ago after being shut down… “SOCOCOVID expects that setting up more testing centres in Kano should be the right step and right thing to do, instead of wasting scarce commodity and resources on areas of less concern.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
