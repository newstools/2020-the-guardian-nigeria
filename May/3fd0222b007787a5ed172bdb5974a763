The MGI Scrabble Premier League (MSPL) has cancelled the Match Day Two of the scrabble league scheduled to take place this weekend (May 9) at Ibeto Hotels, Abuja due to the continuing impact of the COVID-19 virus globally. This decision, according to the MGI, was taken in the best interest of the Nigerian players as they continue to navigate to safety in these difficult times. Speaking on the cancellation of the fixtures, Lukman Owolabi, the convener of the event, said MGI was working on alternative arrangements to resume play at the earliest practicable time. He added that his team would continue to assess the impact of COVID-19 and make announcements on a tournament-by-tournament basis. “One of the options being considered is to merge Match Day Two & Three of the MGI Scrabble Premier League on a weekend in July or August, provided it is safe to do so if the ban on social gatherings has been lifted by the authorities. Further announcement on this will be made on or before June 19, 2020. “It is our hope that life will return to normal soon rather than later, and we can all return to physical jamming sessions/tournaments. “In the meantime, let us continue to stay safe with our families and follow COVID-19 guidelines. Thank you all for your cooperation and continued support,” he said.
