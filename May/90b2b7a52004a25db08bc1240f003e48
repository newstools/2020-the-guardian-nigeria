Professor of Sociology, University of Lagos (UNILAG) and Chairman, Education Committee, Iwo Board of Trustees, Lai Olurode, has extolled the Federal Government for approving the establishment of a college of education in Iwo land, Osun State. Olurode in a statement titled “Iwo land is grateful to Mr. President,” said the people of Iwo would forever remain grateful to the Federal Government forgiven them hope “when we could not even see any ray of light at the end a very dark tunnel.” Recall that President Muhammadu Buhari had on April 16, 2020, approved the establishment of six new colleges of education in the six geopolitical zones to address the emergency education needs of the country. Olurode who described the development as a noble demonstration of fairness and justice said Iwo local government has the largest population in Osun state and will rank high in Nigeria as one of the most populous. Despite its huge population, he lamented that they have been marginalised, neglected and disrespected by various political leaders who regularly take undue advantage of the people during elections. He said: “For so long, Iwo land has consistently been denied its due by greedy politicians who recognise Iwo only for votes. These had little respect if any for justice. They are audacious in the main and rigidly pursue the path of winners take all. They not only routinely tread the path of winners takes all, but they are also ready to sacrifice means in the pursuit of goals. No room for the voices of the downtrodden to become visible. Recalling how wearisome and hopeless the journey was, Olurode stated, “In the struggle for the college, our people remained prayerful and resolute while they made contacts. The major lesson is that the grassroots must never rest their hopes entirely in the elites. We must participate in the affairs of our communities.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
