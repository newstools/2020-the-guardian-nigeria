Shortlists 14 Chinese, seven Nigerian firms The Lagos State government yesterday said that it would conclude financial foreclosure for the 38-kilometre 4th Mainland Bridge project before the end of first quarter of 2021. The financial foreclosure is the last stage of the bidding process before construction works commence on the bridge, which is expected to be completed in three years. Special Adviser to Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu on Works and Infrastructure, Mrs. Aramide Adeyoye, who disclosed this during a press briefing at Alausa, Ikeja, stressed that 14 Chinese, three Spanish and seven Nigerian firms and a Mexican firm had been shortlisted from the 52 firms that showed Expression of Interest (EoI) on the project. Adeyoye said the 4th Mainland Bridge, which had been in the pipework for about 20 years, was intended to provide a useful additional link between  the Lagos Mainland (Ikorodu) and the Eti-Osa corridor in consonance with the stateâ€™s Transport Master Plan (STMP) and the Eti Osa/Ikorodu Master Plan, with the adoption of Public Private Partnerships (PPP) as the procurement  model. She stressed that the state was determined to make an informed decision on the project at the best interest of Lagosians irrespective where the funding is coming from. She also said that the construction of Pen Cinema flyover and access roads in Agege, had been scheduled for completion in September this year. Also, the special adviser said the state government was determined to complete the outstanding works on the Murtala Muhammed International Airport Road, which is currently at 92 per cent stage of completion.
