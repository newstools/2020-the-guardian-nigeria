50 Cent and Marquise | BET Controversial American rapper 50 Cent has been in public feuds with quite a number of fellow celebrities but his feud also extends home as he is not on good terms with his first child. The rapper opened up about his strained relationship with his eldest son Marquise Jackson during an Instagram live chat with Van Lathan on XXL‘s IG. 50 Cent who recently released a new book titled “Hustle Harder, Hustle Smarter” made it clear that all love is lost between them. When asked about his relationship with Marquise, the “Empire” star said: “It is sad, it’s a sad situation. When you pray for success, you don’t necessarily pray for the things that come with it. It’s no such thing as success without jealousy without envy or entitlement.” 50 went on to say that he would pay over $1 million in child support and that Marquise “had everything I didn’t have.” When Lathan asked if he loved his son, 50 said that he “used to.” He continued: “I didn’t think that success would cost me my firstborn but it’s the situation it is. Like, my grandfather used to say, ‘If it rattles like a snake and slithers like a snake, is it a snake or do you need to be bit?’” This is coming just some weeks after 50 Cent revealed that he would pick fellow controversial rapper Tekashi 6ix9ine over his own son. “Nah, I ain’t heard from 6ix9ine. He’s his mother’s child now. He told on everybody,” 50 said during an IG Live stream. “He better than Marquise, though. I’ll take him before I take my actual biological son. Fuck that n***a.” Earlier this year 50 Cent made a joke about Oprah Winfrey after she took a fall on stage while speaking at an event in Inglewood, California.
