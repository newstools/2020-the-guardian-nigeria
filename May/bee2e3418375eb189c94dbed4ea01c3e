Audition Holds Online May 20 – 30
Following the success of its previous editions, organisers of Big Brother Naija (formerly Big Brother Nigeria), a reality TV show has announced that the fifth season of the show will premiere in July this year. According to MultiChoice Nigeria, frontline organiser of the reality show, this year’s edition audition process, which commenced on Wednesday, May 20, will end on Saturday, May 30. In a statement issued by MultiChoice Nigeria, potential contestants are expected to record a two-minute video of themselves, stating why they should be picked to be a Housemate in season 5 of Big Brother Naija. Thereafter, they are to log on to www.africamagic.tv/BBAudition to fill out the online registration form and upload their videos. The online audition is free and open to interested male and female participants who are of Nigerian nationality with a valid Nigerian passport and must be 21 years of age by June 1, 2020. Speaking on the return of BBNaija, the Chief Executive Officer of MultiChoice Nigeria, Mr. John Ugbe said, “Big Brother Naija has been widely regarded as one of Africa’s biggest entertainment exports, being the biggest showcase of Nigeria’s diversity outside of core Nollywood. This fifth season promises to be more adventurous, exciting and entertaining, and will undoubtedly be the biggest thing on African television in 2020.” “The timing of the show is also particularly important, given the dominance of the COVID-19 pandemic; auditions for the fifth edition will now hold online and viewers and stakeholders alike can rest assured knowing that global best practices, precautions and preventive measures will be followed throughout the show, even as we guarantee the premium entertainment BBNaija is renowned for,” he added. As the new edition draws near, fans and viewers can get ready for the excitement and entertainment that comes with the show, especially with its unending drama, intrigue, romance, Friday night games, Saturday night parties and overall, the battle of wits, as the Housemates vie for the ultimate prize. With the Big Brother Naija reality show, MultiChoice Nigeria is committed to providing premium content and entertainment on its DStv and GOtv platforms. The reality TV show continues to produce some of the country’s biggest TV personalities and pop culture influencers since its maiden edition in 2006. Some of the personalities include Ebuka Obi-Uchendu, Gideon Okeke, Efe Ejeba, Bisola Aiyeola, Tokunbo ‘Tboss’ Idowu and more recently, Mercy Eke, Mike Edwards, Miracle Ikechukwu, Tobi Bakre, Cynthia ‘Cee-C’ Nwadiora, Bamike ‘BamBam’ Olawunmi, Tunde ‘Teddy A’ Adenibuyan. However, the show has come under intense knocks from many Nigerians, who have called for its improvement. They condemned show, saying it is a profitable show, but a cause for alarm. According to some viewers of the programme, the show is an insult to their intelligence, as it promotes immorality among contestants. Hence, they condemned how the housemates often engage in immoral acts such as kissing each other as if they had been legitimately being married. Mrs. Idiat Kajogbola, a mother of four said the show has become addictive to her teenage children, stressing that her wards indulges in watching it. “I always engage my children in productive activities while the show is on. My children are under eighteen. They should not be exposed to anything that is pornographic in nature. With the COVID-19 and partial lockdown of key sectors of the country, particularly the schools, which we don’t know when they re-open, the children will be more glue to the show.” For Mrs. Oluyinka Kolawole, the show should be censored by the appropriate government regulatory agencies to remove all obscene portions before transmitting it for public viewing.
