The suspect, Egbuchulem A 47-year-old man, Uchenna Egbuchulem, has been arrested by the Imo State police command for allegedly raping and impregnating his 17-year-old daughter, (name withheld). Egbuchulem is a native of Nduhu Alaenyi, Ogwa, in Mbaitoli local government area of the state. The culprit had lived with the victim for the past 15 years after his wife, from Ivory Cost, left the marriage over domestic violence. He was said to have threatened to kill his daughter with a cutlass if she refused to allow him sleep with her. According to sources in the village, after succeeding in violating the girl, Egbuchulem continued abusing her until she became pregnant. Trouble was said to have started when Egbuchulem, upon discovery that her daughter was pregnant for him, decided to take her to a medical doctor in the village. He was said to have pleaded with the doctor to buy the pregnancy and the yet-to-be-delivered baby at the cost of N200,000. But the doctor, instead, took the girl to the traditional ruler of the community, Eze Agu of Alaenyi Ogwa autonomous community. Upon enquiries by the monarch, the girl was said to have admitted to the act. Confirming the incident, spokesman of the Imo State police command, Orlando Ikeokwu, said Egbuchulem is currently in police custody, while investigation is ongoing. “The mother of the girl who is a native of Ivory Coast was said to have left the marriage and returned back home when the girl was an infant. The dad then began to take advantage of her. He was said to have forced her to bed by threatening to kill her with a machete.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
