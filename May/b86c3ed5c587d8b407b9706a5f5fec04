Coalition of labour unions in Kano State has issued a 14-day ultimatum to the state government to refund what they described as “illegal deduction” from their May 2020 salaries or prepare for a showdown. Besides, labour insisted that failure of government to return the “unexplained” deduction before the end of its ultimatum, which begins on Wednesday, May 27, 2020, workers would embark on seven days warning strike from Monday, June 15. Addressing journalists after an emergency meeting in Kano yesterday, state chairman of Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Kabiru Minjibir, expressed disappointment over the action of the state government, which he declared a clear violation of the agreement on the new wage law of 2019. Meanwhile, the unions have demanded occupational safety incentives, hazard allowance and life insurance from government for health workers who incidentally contracted the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) while rendering service to patients. The communiqué released after the congress read in part, “Labour rejected in its entirety the illegal and illogical deduction from workers’ salaries for the month of May 2020 and call on government to respect the collective bargaining agreement reached between the government and labour on consequential adjustment arising from N30,000 minimum wage law implementation in December 2019 and stop further deduction unconditionally.” NLC also demanded immediate payment of April to November 2019 salary arrears to all categories of civil servants in the state according to the agreement government reached with Joint Negotiation Council (JNC) in December 2019 on consequential adjustment. The meeting also demanded the refund of May 2020 relativity allowances to civil servants in the state and stoppage of further deduction to respect the agreement reached in May 2018. The union regretted that instead of the government to renege on its promise on payment of salaries and full implementation of the agreement on consequential adjustment arising from the implementation of the new wage, it resorted to salary deduction.
