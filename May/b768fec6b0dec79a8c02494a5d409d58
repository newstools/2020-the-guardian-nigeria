There was some mix-up over observance of the Id-el-Fitri prayers in Kebbi, as some Muslims celebrated the event, yesterday, even though the Sultan of Sokoto, Muhammad Sa’ad Abubakar, had advised that the occasion be observed later. It was gathered that Muslims, who observed 29 or 30-day Ramadan fasting were expected to celebrate the Sallah, but the Sultan of Sokoto declared, yesterday, that the committee on siting the moon could not find it. He, therefore, said the fasting should continue and be completed on the 30th day. But Sheik Mohammed Auwal Laban, who is the second in command at the Kebbi State Government House Mosque, while speaking with journalists shortly after the prayers, explained that they did not follow what the Sultan said because some Muslims confirmed that they had seen the moon, which was why they were allowed to celebrate. “Those that are still fasting have not offended God because they did not see the moon. And those of us that celebrated believe we saw the moon. So, there is no problem,” he said. An Islamic scholar, Mallam Issa Hassan, said those that fasted for either 29 or 30 days are in the right direction, though it is good to follow the advice of leaders.
