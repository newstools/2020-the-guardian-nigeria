Besides, the red chamber received a correspondence from the President requesting it to confirm the nominees for the Nigerian Law Reform Commission, with Professor Jumai Audi as chairman. The commissioners-designate are Ebele Bernard Chima (South East); Bassey Dan Abia (South South) and Mohammed Ibraheem (South West).The legislators also received another request for the confirmation of Diana Okonta (South South) and Ya’ana Talib Yaro (North East) as Non-Executive Directors of the Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC). Consequently, Senate Leader, Yahaya Abdullahi, moved a motion for the chamber to expedite the confirmations. Ruling, Lawan also urged speed before referring the NDIC nominees to the Senator Uba Sani-led Committee on Banking, Insurance and Financial Institutions which is reporting back in two weeks. Also yesterday, the Senate ordered heads of security agencies to probe the alleged complicity of their officers and men in acts constituting breaches to the interstate travel ban and curfew imposed by the Federal Government to check the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic nationwide. Following a motion moved in that respect by Senator Ike Ekweremadu, the legislative chamber urged prosecution of anyone found wanting.
