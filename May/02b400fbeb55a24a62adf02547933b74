Its benefits, which account for its popularity, has given it a place on many spa menus. Dry brushing is brushing the skin before showering in a particular pattern with a dry brush. The pattern for dry brushing is directed toward the heart, starting with the feet and hands. There are several benefits to dry brushing, and these are 5 of them: It detoxifies the body
A significant part of the immune system, the lymphatic system, is made up of organs, lymph nodes, ducts, and vessels, which help in fighting off infections. The lymph nodes filter the flow of fluids through the system and can become clogged due to illness or the presence of toxins in the body.
Dry brushing helps detoxify the body by releasing these toxins through sweat. The coarse bristle of the brush stimulates the pores and opens them up, which makes it easier for the body to sweat. This, in turn, reduces the toxins that flow through the lymphatic system. It exfoliates the skin
Dry brushing is an effective way to exfoliate the entire body. Exfoliation gets rid of dead skin cells allowing for the growth of new ones. This process reduces the chance of developing skin related problems, giving you a youthful glow. Dry brushing is also an excellent choice for many, as they do not have to bother about skin-ravaging ingredients.
Exfoliating on dry skin increases the friction making it more effective as opposed to exfoliating on wet skin. Dry brushing exfoliates dead skin cells, keeping your skin in prime condition and ready to absorb ingredients from your skincare products effectively. It helps with Cellulite Removal
A skin condition with a ‘rippled’ or ‘cottage cheese’ appearance, cellulite affects many people, a large number of which are women. Massages reduce the appearance of cellulite, although temporarily, and dry brushing does the same for more extended periods. Increased circulation in the body plumps the skin making cellulite look a lot less noticeable.
While it won’t completely get rid of cellulite, it immobilises cellulite and allows for even distribution of fat deposits under the skin. With dry brushing, your skin has a much smoother, firmer look and feel. It is relaxing
Dry brushing is another great way to relax after a long day at work. It helps you calm your nerves down after the vigorous up and down movements you must have done during the day. Dry brushing at home also gives you the relaxed feeling that comes after a spa day while keeping your skin in prime condition. It improves energy levels 
Another benefit of dry brushing is that it stimulates the body’s energy levels, giving you the kick you need to start your day. As dry brushing stimulates blood flow and circulation, it perks up your energy levels. How To Dry Brush
Dry brushing is often done daily, before each shower in the morning and evening using a gentle brush. To start dry brushing, use a soft brush and apply little pressure. As time goes on, you can move on to a firmer brush used with firm pressure. Be sure to adjust the brush pressure to match different parts of your body, making it comfortable and stimulating to improve circulation. Use long, smooth strokes to brush from the bottom of your feet up your legs toward your heart/chest; each section can be brushed between 8-10 times. Repeat this process on your arms brushing from your palm, up the arm toward your heart. For the stomach and armpits, be sure to brush in a circular motion. Do this all over your body before taking a shower and use a vitamin E based moisturiser after your shower. Final Word
Be sure to choose a brush with dense and natural bristles for your dry brushing. Avoid vigorously brushing your skin to prevent your skin from drying up and to keep it in top-notch condition. For people with sensitive skin or any type of rash, skip this process entirely as it would only inflame your skin more. Remember to use a moisturiser after your shower.
