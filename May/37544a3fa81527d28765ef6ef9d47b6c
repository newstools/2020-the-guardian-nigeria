• Forex unification, subsidy removal top reasons for IMF’s $3.4 billion loan approval Despite accessing $3.4billion from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Federal Government still needs at least $10.6billion or about N4.1trillion to address the gaps in the country’s Balance of Payment (BOP), without mounting pressure on the foreign exchange reserves of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).
   
With capital inflows impeded, pressure has continued to be on the forex reserves, closing lower at $33.4billion on Tuesday, down from $38.53billion it opened at the at the beginning of the year.
   
Indeed, the coronavirus has impacted the country’s capacity to finance its budget, as oil prices, on which the budget was predicated, remains below estimates.
   
Oil prices yesterday, recorded some gains as Brent Crude rose to $25.20, while Nigeria’s Bonny Light was up by 11.18 per cent to close at $16.51 per barrel as at 6:07pm local time.
   
The IMF noted that the shock would be only partially mitigated by lower oil-related imports of goods and services and income outflows, and an overall reduction in imports on the heels of a sharp output contraction and exchange
rate depreciation.  Finance Minister, Zainab Ahmed and Central Bank Governor, Godwin Emefiele, signed the letter dated April 21, according to Bloomberg.
Recall that last week, the CBN had debited N1.47trillion ($3.8billion) from commercial banks as additional cash reserves for failing to meet regulatory targets, a move seen by bankers and analysts as a way to ease pressure on the naira.
   
Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair, of the IMF, Mitsuhiro Furusawa, in a statement, said: “The COVID-19 outbreak—magnified by the sharp fall in international oil prices and reduced global demand for oil products—is severely impacting economic activity in Nigeria. 
 
“The authorities’ immediate actions to respond to the crisis are welcome. The short-term focus on fiscal accommodation would allow for higher health spending and help alleviate the impact of the crisis on households and businesses. Steps taken toward a more unified and flexible exchange rate are also important and unification of the exchange rate should be expedited.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
