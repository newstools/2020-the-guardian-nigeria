 Gombe State Taskforce on COVID-19 PHOTO:Twitter  Prof. Idris Mohammed gave this warning on Friday in Gombe during the daily press conference on COVID-19 cases in the state. Mohammed said people were no longer observing the measures put in place by the state government to protect them, adding “not until COVID-19 is over, it will not be business as usual.” He said that the state government was putting in a lot of efforts toward ensuring that the virus does not find its way into communities, hence the people should support the government to fight the pandemic. According to him, the level of compliance needed to defeat a pandemic such as a Coronavirus is 100 per cent or near such and with that community, the transmission will be prevented. “We have observed that people are not complying strictly with the conditions on laid down by Gov. Inuwa Yahaya of Gombe state for relaxing the lockdown. “People go about their businesses as if it is business as usual which is not. It can’t be business as usual until we have conquered COVID-19. “We have noticed that people do not wear masks, people congregate in large numbers and go to the markets in large numbers too. We are not happy seeing these,” he said. He appealed to residents to understand that the restrictions were put in place for their own good, hence the need for total compliance to make the state safe for everyone. The chairman added that the state had so far tested 1, 702 persons while receiving 1, 440 results, adding that 144 of the results received were positive while 92 persons had been discharged. He said presently there were only 20 persons in isolation centres in the state while 262 results were still being awaited.
