• Says 39 People Killed In Clash Between Hausa, Chobok Communities 
The Chairman of Lamurde council, Mr. Burto Williams, has refuted a report by an online medium that there was mass burial in his area yesterday after the deadly clashed between the Hausa and Chobok communities on Friday. Williams, who spoke to The Guardian on phone yesterday, described the online report as embarrassing to the journalism profession, pointing out that the author has demonstrated that he is suffering from linguistic deficiencies. “When you say mass burial it means all the people killed are buried in one place, but when the Muslims and Christians take their corpses to bury, it is no longer mass burial. It is time for media houses to screen the certificates of people they employ. This is a disgrace to the media house involved and the profession, if reporters are not properly educated, it means Nigeria is sitting on a keg of gunpowder,” he stated. The council boss, who admitted that 39 people lost their lives during the bloody clash, pointed out that the casualties were recorded from the two warring communities of Hausa and Chobok. He said that security agents in the state have brought the crisis under control and that normalcy has returned with both the military and police keeping vigil in the council. The Chief Press Secretary to Governor Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri, denied the report, saying the governor was in Lamurde yesterday to visit a village that was attacked. The media aide, Humwashi Wonosiko, said that the online media report was done to promote crisis, which he said is against the ethics of journalism.
