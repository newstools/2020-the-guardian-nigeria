Paul Okoye | Naija News Nigerian singer Paul Okoye of the defunct music duo P Square is taking a walk down memory lane as he recalls when he was poor. The entertainer who goes by the stage name Rudeboy currently lives a lavish lifestyle by many standards but he is reminding fans that it was always glamourous in his life. Taking to social media to share a photo of his enviable mansion and expensive living room, the “Reason With Me” crooner recalls when he was struggling and hustling. According to him, he is where he is today because he put in lots of attention to what he knows how to do best which is singing. Sharing a snap of his house, he wrote: “F*ck it !!! I don suffer  forget the lifestyle and glamour, when I think back with all the struggles and hustle, how I got to this stage, without going for holidays and trips till date, just strictly doing what I know how to do best ……. I just thank God for life.” Arguably Africa’s most successful music duo, P Square has several hit songs to their names and were considered one of the best music exports from Africa. The duo was made of singing twin brothers Peter and Paul Okoye and they were managed by their senior brother Jude Okoye. The duo split for good in 2017 back much to the displeasure of fans who pleaded with them to get back together. That has not happened and they have since launched solo careers. According to a letter by Peter (also known as Mr. P) sent to their lawyer Festus Keyamo (SAN), Peter demanded a termination of the contract between the group.
