To cushion the effect of the Coronavirus pandemic, ActionAid Nigeria recently distributed relief materials to more than 230 households in Wesere and Aivoji communities in Badagry West Local Council Development Area (WLCDA), located near Benin Republic. The palliative was distributed through ActionAid’s local partner, Humanity Family Foundation for Peace and Development (HUFFPED). Communications Advisor, ActionAid Nigeria, Kemi Akinremi said the distribution of palliatives in the communities was to cushion the effect of economy downturn on the people as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, which has led to hunger in the communities. Executive Director of HUFFPED, Henry Adenigba revealed that the communities decided the items distributed as palliatives. ‘‘Women in the community specifically requested for food and ActionAid and HUFFPED decided we should provide them with a two-week supply, which comprises of 5kg of rice, 10kg of beans, 10kg of gaari, half crate of egg, and other food condiments like a roll of tomato paste, maggi, and salt.” Awonronsu Maumeh, one of the beneficiaries in Wesere community, said the food package is a huge relief and will cater for two weeks feeding for his family. ‘‘I rely heavily on handouts from people in the community because my disability has restrained me from being able to work, and my children have also gone to town to look for a source of livelihood. They often send me money to feed but it is not regular. With the provisions from ActionAid, my two weeks feeding is assured,” he said. Chairman, Badagry West LCDA, Joseph Henugbe, while appreciating the orgnaisations for their generosity, said more needed to be done for the people. “The palliatives from the government need to be augmented.”Members of the communities were also sensitised on the precautionary measures to stay safe and remain healthy during the COVID-19 outbreak.
