Tyson, 53, recently shared a video of him carrying out punching drills with a trainer. The video captioned “I’m a bad boy for life” is coming a week after the two-time world champion told rapper T.I that he wanted to make a comeback to the ring.  Tyson had during an Instagram live session with T.I admitted that he had been training so as to return to the ring for a four-round exhibition bout in a bid to make some money for charity. “I’ve been hitting the mitts for the last week. That’s been tough, my body is really jacked up and really sore from hitting the mitts. I’ve been working out, I’ve been trying to get in the ring, I think I’m going to box some exhibitions and get in shape. “I want to go to the gym and get in shape to be able to box three or four-round exhibitions for some charities and stuff. Some charity exhibitions, make some money, help some homeless and drug-affected motherf****r like me. “I do two hours on cardio, I do the bike and the treadmill for an hour, then I do some light weights, 300, 250 reps. Then I start my day with the boxing thing, I go in there and hit the mitts, 30 minutes, 25 minutes, start getting in better condition.” But George Foreman, who became the oldest heavyweight champion at 45 back in 1994, believes Tyson should stay retired. “Tyson has done enough great things for boxing,’ the two-time world heavyweight champion posted on Twitter when asked about Tyson’s comeback.” Mike Tyson competed from 1985 to 2005. He reigned as the undisputed world heavyweight champion and holds the record as the youngest boxer to win a heavyweight title, at 20 years, four months, and 22 days old. He was the first heavyweight boxer to simultaneously hold the WBA, WBC and IBF titles, and the only heavyweight to successively unify them.
