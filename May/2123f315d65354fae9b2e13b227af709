The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has approved Sahel MediCare Centre, a private laboratory in Katsina State, as a test centre for coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The centre, located within the state metropolitan area, was built and equipped by a private citizen who was worried over the rise in a number of COVID-19 cases. Governor Aminu Masari said yesterday that NCDC officials had inspected the laboratory and given the nod for it to commence operation. On the state government’s effort at combating the disease, Masari said Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) would soon be signed on modalities for the laboratory’s operation. He added that the lab was capable of processing 170 samples daily and that the facility would help reduce the burden on the Kano and Abuja offices of NCDC. Lamenting that results of more than 400 samples sent to the NCDC laboratory in Kano and Abuja were still being awaited, the governor said the lab would go a long way in helping to get results of in good time, and that neigbouring states would also benefit from the project. Masari also said the lockdown in the state would continue in Katsina and Daura councils where 80 per cent of cases were discovered. He said the lockdown would commence today by 7 a.m. and that the rest 32 councils of the state would be made to adhere to both inter-state and inter-council travels.
