Jenner who Forbes had named the “The Youngest Self-Made Billionaire Ever” in March 2019, was stripped of her billionaire status in a bombshell report by the publication on Friday. In the report, Forbes accused Jenner of having lied about her earnings and alleged that she had forged her tax returns in a bid to earn the The 22-year-old took to her twitter page in reaction to the accusations: “what am i even waking up to. i thought this was a reputable site.. all i see are a number of inaccurate statements and unproven assumptions lol. i’ve never asked for any title or tried to lie my way there EVER. period,” she tweeted. “even creating tax returns that were likely forged” that’s your proof? so you just THOUGHT they were forged? like actually what am i reading. “but okay i am blessed beyond my years, i have a beautiful daughter, and a successful business and i’m doing perfectly fine. “i can name a list of 100 things more important right now than fixating on how much money i have” Forbes said the Jenners invited them into their homes and accountants’ offices, where they supplied the publication with tax returns “that were likely forged.” Forbes also likened their actions to Donald Trump, writing, “the unusual lengths to which the Jenners have been willing to go—including inviting Forbes into their mansions and CPA’s offices, and even creating tax returns that were likely forged—reveals just how desperate some of the ultra-rich are to look even richer.” According to Forbes’ new calculations, Kylie Jenner is worth just under $900million.
