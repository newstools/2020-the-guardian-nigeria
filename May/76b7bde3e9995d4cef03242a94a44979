The euphoria surrounding the easy passage of the 2020 Federal Government budget appears to have been significantly diminished by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy. The 2020 budget, which focused primarily on fiscal consolidation, investment in critical infrastructure, incentivising private sector investment and the enhancement of social investment programmes has seemingly been torn to shreds by the COVID-19 pandemic. The threat of this pandemic to the global economy is real, as it has seriously disrupted the functioning of all economies across the globe starting from China where the pandemic began its deadly trip. 
 
As a consequence of the pandemic on the global economy, the crude oil markets have literally crashed with crude oil prices falling by more than 60% of its value before the onset of the pandemic. Nigeria is mainly affected since crude oil export is its main foreign exchange earner. 
 
The use of $57 per barrel as the benchmark in projecting revenue from oil in the budget has rendered many of the estimates in the document ineffective with the recent turn of events. The 2020 budget which was accompanied by a Finance Bill had increased the value added tax from 5% to 7.5%, among others and had an estimated total aggregate spending plan of N10.59 trillion with a deficit of N1.8 trillion. In the approved document, the total government revenue was estimated at N8.155 trillion with oil revenue estimated at N2.64 trillion, non-oil revenue at N1.81 trillion and other revenues at N3.7 trillion. With all these, the total budget size was planned to be higher than the 2019 comparative estimate of N7.594 trillion inclusive of the government-owned enterprises. With the unwelcome effect of the pandemic on the economy, the bulk of these estimates are currently unrealisable. With the fall in both local and foreign trade volumes as well as decreased economic activity in the country currently, it is even difficult to realise the targets expected from value added tax and customs duties.
