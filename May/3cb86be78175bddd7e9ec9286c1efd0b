Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje is presently in a crucial meeting with Islamic clerics at Government house in Kano as the one week state impose lockdown ends today. The crucial meeting coincided with fresh two weeks lockdown imposed on Kano by the presidential taskforce on COVID-19 on Monday. Governor Ganduje was expected to address journalists on whether or not the lockdown will be lifted especially as Muslims approach the end of fasting month of Ramadan and subsequent eid-fitr festival. Before now, there are strong indication that Ganduje might announced the relaxation of the lockdown today because of critical economic consideration and stiff resistance on continue closure of places of worship. Reliable source disclosed that among salient reasons while Ganduje engaged the Ulama (religious leaders) include condition for reopening of Friday Jumaat prayers and eid-fitir prayers. Already, there are pressure mounting on government to reopen the mosques and churches in Kano, especially as government relax the lockdown for six hours every Mondays and Thursdays. Beyond the pressure, some Imams last week held Jumaat prayers and even threatened to file out for the congregation prayers of eid-fitir against government order. Similarly Marketers of Kwari major Textile Market, Sabin Gari Market and other big Markets in Kano were also grumbling under the lockdown which they said has affected their economic well-being. Although, Governor Ganduje last week said government is highly ready to relax the lockdown, if only Kano Peoples are ready to obey the COVID19 protocols, Ganduje is already at a fix with the fresh two weeks lockdown imposed by presidential taskforce.
