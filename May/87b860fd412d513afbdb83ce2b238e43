An 82-year-old hypertensive widow has recovered from the coronavirus disease after receiving a nine-day treatment at the Isolation and Treatment Centre, Asubiaro, Osogbo, Osun State. She was confirmed positive and admitted at the isolation centre on the 13th of May 2020. State Commissioner for Health, Dr. Rafiu Isamotu said the septuagenarian’s recovery beats the odds, as elderly people with chronic diseases are the highest risk group because mostly, they are unable to recover from COVID-19. He noted that the patient who contracted the disease from coming in contact with an infected person showed no symptoms of the virus before her sample was collected except for diarrhoea. “A follow-up at her home after her discharge revealed that she was stable and completely recovered,” he added.
