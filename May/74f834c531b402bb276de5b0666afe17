 Blessing Okagbare after winning a medal for Nigeria                       Photo: dailysportsng.com  United States-based Nigerian sprinter, Blessing Okagbare is in the news again. The Olympics medalist, who recently filed for divorce from her husband, ex-Super Eagles star Jude Ighoteguonor, after their six-year old marriage broke down, says she is no longer interested in dating. According to TheNewsGuru, Okagbare took to her Instastories to declare that she had lost interest in dating and gave conditions on what her next suitors must do to win her heart. The report quoted Okagbare as saying that any man who might be interested in getting into a relationship with her should write an essay of 500 words on how he would not waste her time. A few days ago, Okagbare’s estrange husband, Jude Ighoteguonor, broke his silence on the divorce saga saying he had long moved on with his life. He stated that he does not need a dime from the sprinter, contrary to earlier reports that he (Ighoteguonor) was seeking a huge sum of N100 million from the sprinter, who filed for the divorce. “I don’t need a dime from her,” he said. “She filed for a divorce with so many allegations and my lawyers, in turn, replied her lawyer. My philosophy in life is very simple. I don’t get hard on myself over material things. I have long moved on since 2018. Women are fragile and sometimes they just want to be let loose and fly only to regret later. She knows me and she knows the truth. “I love my wife, we have come a very long way from my active days as a footballer but when a woman is no longer interested in a relationship, there is nothing you can do about it,” Ighoteguonor stated. A source close to the sprinter had accused Ighoteguonor during a chat with The Guardian that the ex-footballer allegedly squandered the resources Okagbare invested in some businesses in Nigeria.
