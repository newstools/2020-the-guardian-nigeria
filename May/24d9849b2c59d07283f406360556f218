According to Lawan,  the new price regime would enable PPMC to boost its sales volumes from the billions of litres of Petrol it has in storage while providing affordable price to millions of customers. He stated that the new price was arrived at after extensive review of market realities by the PPMC internal price review unit. Lawan noted that Automotive Gas Oil (AGO), otherwise called diesel, being already deregulated, its prices are determined by market forces.
“On March 18, 2020, the NNPC reviewed its PMS ex-coastal, ex-depot and NNPC Retail pump prices. “Thus, effective 19 March 2020, NNPC ex-coastal price for PMS was reviewed downwards from N117.6/litre to N99.44/litre while the ex-depot price was reduced from N133.28/litre to N113.28/litre,” he said.
