• IPAD Presents Independent Report
• Govt, Northern Imo Residents Deny Knowledge Confusion appears to be brewing in Imo State over the authenticity of information regarding the N8million cattle compensatory payment for cattle allegedly killed, maimed and missing in the state and how the payment was made and the persons who received it. The confusion arose following submission of an independent report by the Imo Peoples Action for Democracy (IPAD), coordinated by Marjorie Ezihe and Secretary, Chibundu Uchegbu, yesterday, accusing the state government of hastily making the compensatory payment to herders without following the local custom and traditional authority. A few days ago, Fulani cattle herders had camped their cattle, numbering over 100, at St. Dominic’s in Umuelegwi Compound, Ezi East in Onicha, Ezinihitte Council, when youths in the area stormed the camp, demanding that the cows be evacuated. When the cattle were taken to Eziudo in the same council, another round of protest by the youths allegedly dispersed the herds, killing and wounding some. But in a twist, the leader of northern community traditional ruler in the state, Alhaji Auwal Baba Suleiman; state Chairman, Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association (MACBAN), Yahaya Haruna and Special Assistant to Governor Hope Uzodinma on Northern Affairs, Suleiman, said they were unaware of the N8million payment.
