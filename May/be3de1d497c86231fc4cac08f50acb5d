President of the Muaythai Federation of Nigeria, Paul Egonu, has described the decision to pay N50, 000 to athletes to cushion the effects of the COVID-19 lockdown on them is an example that should be emulated by all well-meaning organisations. Commending the Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Sunday Dare, for directing the payment of the funds to the accounts of Nigerian athletes, Egonu said the minister’s gesture has shown an uncommon fervour to the plight of his constituents, adding that the athletes have no excuse not to reciprocate the gesture by working harder to bring honour to the country. According to Egonu, the payments to over 200 athletes “shows that the minister means well for sports men and women in the country. “This will spur the athletes to be more determined and focused in their quest to win more laurels for the country at major championships. “The minister floated a relief fund for the athletes, whose source of earnings has ceased as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic that has forced the suspension of all major sporting events in the world. The gestures is highly commendable,” he said. The Muaythai Federation president charged the athletes to continue to adhere to safety measures advised by medical experts to break the chain of infection of COVID-19. These include regular washing of their hands with soap and water or the use of sanitizer to avoid infections, he said, adding that athletes should dispose off used tissue after sneezing or coughing “and most importantly stay at home to stay safe and remain alive.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
