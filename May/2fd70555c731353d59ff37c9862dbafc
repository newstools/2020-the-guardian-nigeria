The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) has declared its intention to get the best possible coach for the Super Falcons no matter where the person comes from. NFF President, Amaju Pinnick disclosed at the weekend that Pricewaterhouse (PWC), which has been given the contract to recruit coaches for the national male and women teams, has drawn out well-structured criteria the coaches must meet to manage any of the teams, adding that the federation is doing everything possible to ensure the Super Falcons get a manager that can keep them of top of African football. “The Super Falcons’ coaching job is open to Nigerian and expatriate coaches, who must meet the standard set by PWC,” Pinnick said, adding, “the company has what it takes to pick the best among the list of applicants. “Some Nigerian coaches based abroad that I have not met have called to inform me that they are interested in the Super Falcons job and I tell them that the federation is not involved in coaches recruitment. “Any interested person should apply to PWC with their credentials. If former Super Falcons’ stars like Mercy Akide, Florence Omagbemi and others are interested in coaching the Falcons, they should apply through PWC. “The company has guidelines a coach must attain to get the job. Any coach PWC picks to handle the Falcons at the end of the day will be accepted by the NFF,” he said. Pinnick also disclosed that the federation is in the process of raising funds that would take care of the salary and accommodation of the Falcons’ coach throughout the duration of his contract, adding, “the girls have achieved more for the country than their male counterparts in African football and they need to be well motivated for future challenges.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
