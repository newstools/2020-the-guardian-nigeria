In a first for one of the most famous women in the world, tennis legend Serena Williams recently debuted as the new face of Stuart Weitzman. This is her first major campaign for a fashion brand. Announcing Williams as its new global spokeswoman on social media, the brand said the relationship started at the beginning of the year. “The tennis trailblazer, social change leader and mother stars in the new 2020 Campaign, which highlights women as pillars of hope and optimism for their communities. “Serena exemplifies this sentiment first as a mother, and also as someone who has demonstrated resilience and courage to overcome obstacles throughout her career. Inspired by this, the campaign features her on a platform, standing tall in silhouettes designed to lift you up. Coupled with the confident energy Serena emanates, the campaign reinforces the notion that women possess the innate strength to be symbols of hope for their communities, a message that is especially relevant right now.” The 2020 Campaign is part of the brand’s ongoing philanthropic partnership with Vital Voices Global Partnership, an international nonprofit dedicated to investing in women leaders who drive global change. The duo selected two women leaders and their organizations focused on lifting up black women who support vulnerable communities in the midst of COVID-19. These leaders are Sage Ke’alohilani Quiamno, co-founder of Future For Us, an organisation dedicated to advancing black women at work and Ashlee Wisdom, founder of Health In Her HUE, a platform that connects black women to healthcare providers, services and resources that are committed to their health and well-being. Shot by Ethan James Green and styled by Gabriella Karefa-Johnson who selected an all-white palette to draw attention to the shoes, a range she said was “classic and refined to elegant and bold to sleek and sexy, all facets that could describe our muse.” A white Dream Bandits bodysuit is the centrepiece of this campaign, with a variety of matching white blazers and trench coats. Taking to her personal Instagram, Serena said, “I worked and finished this exciting project with Stuart Weitzman at the beginning of this year and now we can’t hold it in anymore. I hope through this campaign and partnership with @VitalVoices, we can share a message of hope and optimism, and celebrate women and their ability to lift up their communities. Now, more than ever is a moment to focus on hope and moving forward; I want women of every generation to be inspired to do so, one step at a time.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
