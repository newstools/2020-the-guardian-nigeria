• FG to bail out carriers, ground handlers, others The airline industry’s global debt could rise to $550billion by year-end, the International Air Transport Association (IATA), has said. The debt is a $120billion increase over debt levels at the start of 2020. According to the breakdown, about $67billion of the new debt is composed of government loans ($50 billion), deferred taxes of $5billion and loan guarantees of $12billion.
  
Another $52billion is from commercial sources including commercial loans of $23billion, capital market debt of $18billion, debt from new operating leases $5billion, and accessing existing credit facilities of $6billion.
   
In a related development, the Director-General, Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA), Musa Nuhu, has disclosed that the Federal Government was working on a bailout package to support the local airlines and other operators in the industry. Nuhu, who spoke at a webinar forum recently, said all the heads of aviation parastatals were recently summoned to a meeting to map out ways of developing economic stimulus package for the sector.  The kind of aid provided will influence the speed and strength of the recovery. IATA urged governments still contemplating financial relief to focus on measures that help airlines raise equity financing.
  
“Many airlines are still in desperate need of a financial lifeline. For those governments that have not yet acted, the message is that helping airlines raise equity levels with a focus on grants and subsidies will place them in a stronger position for the recovery.
  
“A tough future is ahead of us. Containing COVID-19 and surviving the financial shock is just the first hurdle. Post-pandemic control measures will make operations more costly. Fixed costs will have to be spread over fewer travellers. And investments will be needed to meet our environmental targets.  On top of all that, airlines will need to repay massively increased debts arising from the financial relief. After surviving the crisis, recovering to financial health will be the next challenge for many airlines,” de Juniac said. Nuhu said the package would not be limited to the airlines alone but the agencies and ground handling companies.
 
“We have made consultations and we are still consulting. We plan to have another consultation with the airlines and the ground handlers. We are developing a programme for an economic stimulus package that is all inclusive. All heads of agencies were recently locked up in a hotel in Abuja with the Minister to map out ways of getting stimulus for the sector. The minister presented a very good case on this with the Vice President,” Nuhu said.The NCAA’s DG noted that air transportation was very critical to a nation, especially Nigeria that is dependent on oil; hence the sector cannot afford to be comatose.
