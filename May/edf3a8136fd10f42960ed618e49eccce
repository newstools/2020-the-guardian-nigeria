Veteran art director Matteo De Cosmo has died from coronavirus complications. He was 52. De Cosmo who was based in New York, worked on several ABC Studios-produced shows including Emergence, The Punisher and Luke Cage. Most recently, he had worked on ABC Studios-produced ABC drama pilot Harlem’s Kitchen starring Delroy Lindo, which shut down production, along with virtually all other pilots and series in mid-March, due to the coronavirus pandemic. Industry colleagues have been paying tribute, among them is Harlem’s Kitchen creator/showrunner Zahir McGhee. “Making television is challenging. But there are people that assure you every day with their talent, passion and smile that anything is possible. Matteo was one of those people,” said McGhee. “We will miss him. The entire Harlem’s Kitchen family extends our deepest condolences to Matteo’s wife, Aris, his son, Marcello, and the countless friends and family that mourn his passing.” De Cosmo also served as art director on numerous features, including 21 Bridges starring Chadwick Boseman, Rob Reiner-directed And So It Goes and Precious, among others. His other TV credits include The Affair and Madam Secretary. ABC Studios released a statement saying: “We were heartbroken to learn that Matteo DeCosmo, a talented art director with whom we’d worked on many productions including a recent pilot, has passed away. He was a true talent, incredibly creative, and beloved by everyone with whom he worked. We will miss him deeply and our hearts go out to his family and friends.” De Cosmo is survived by his wife Aris and his son Marcello.
