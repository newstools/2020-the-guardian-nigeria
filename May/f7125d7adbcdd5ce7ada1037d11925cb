There  was a mild drama yesterday as Waziri Bulama was sworn in as Acting National Secretary of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Bulama, who hails from Borno State, replaced Mai Mala Buni, who was elected governor of Yobe State on the APC platform in last year’s polls. However, APC’s National Vice Chairman (North East), Mustapha Salihu, who had been at the forefront of those opposed to Bulama nomination for the position created a scene when he interrupted National Chairman of the party, Adams Oshiomhole shortly after commencement of proceedings. Salihu, who claimed he was unaware of the swearing in ceremony, insisted that he would have to confer with the Oshiomhole-led National Working Committee (NEC) to be aware of the decision to swear in Bulama into the position. Oshiomhole, who eventually swore in Bulama after conferring with Salihu, justified the decision arguing that Bulama was chosen based on endorsement by party leaders including President Muhammadu Buhari and governors Babagana Zulum, Mohammed Umar and Mai Buni of Borno, Gombe and Yobe states.
