To mobilise and return the energy sector to work safely across the continent, the African Energy Chamber has issued urgent advisory guidelines for the management and safety of oil workers during the COVID-19 pandemic and Africa-wide lockdowns.
 
The Chamber, which said the oil and gas industry has been heavily strained, noted that there is an increasing need to pay critical attention to workers’ safety and putting in place procedures to ensure their transitioning in and out of the workplace.
 
Executive Chairman at the African Energy Chamber, NJ Ayuk, said the guidelines put the safety of workers, host communities and oil operators at the core of the industry’s operations and sector recovery.
 
He advocated the need to always prioritise the health, safety and wellbeing of brave oil workers, who continue to defy insurmountable odds to keep energy production on-going across the continent.
 
According to him, all upstream oil and gas operators are experiencing similar challenges due to reduced workforces and extended periods of lockdown and travel restrictions.
 
The guidelines, he added, would assist operators and governments in ensuring the movement and safety of offshore and onshore oil workers so that the industry can continue while preventing and additional spread of COVID-19.
 
The Chamber noted that such advisory guidelines, which is open for consultationwww.EnergyChamber.org, includes a series of agreements and protocols governing health monitoring and travel authorisations given to oil workers before, during and after th3ir mobilisation on site.
