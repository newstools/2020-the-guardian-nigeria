In a message on his official Facebook page entitled: ‘Get Ready For Life After The COVID-19 Lockdown,’ Joshua encouraged his followers to face whatever situation they find themselves during and after the pandemic with equanimity, noting that it could be a blessing in disguise.
   
“If you don’t get your job back or you don’t get a proper job or a full-time job or you run into loss or lose a loved one after this lockdown, don’t despair; don’t doubt your God. God is about to establish you,” he said.
   
He admonished people to adjust their lifestyles and live modestly and sincerely, adding: “Those who respond to the demands of the age will end up as overcomers.”
