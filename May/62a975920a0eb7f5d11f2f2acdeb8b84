• Dreams of winning AFCON, qualifying for Qatar 2022 World Cup
Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) President, Amaju Pinnick, has restated that there was no time the ability of Coach Gernot Rohr to lead the Super Eagles successfully was called to question. Stating that the delay in the renewal of the German’s deal was to ensure meticulousness, the NFF boss assured Nigerians that the Super Eagles would be up and doing in future contests. Twitting yesterday via his official handle, Pinnick submitted:  “I am happy to announce that the NFF and Gernot Rohr have concluded all contractual discussions, and he will stay on as coach of the Super Eagles. “We have always had confidence in his abilities, and we are confident that the national team can only go higher from here.”The former chairman of the Delta State Sports Commission said the football body would focus on qualifying Nigeria for the World Cup and winning the Nations Cup, conditions he considered “sacrosanct” for the tactician. He added:  “Like the Minister of Youth and Sports Development has rightly noted, we are uncompromising on these goals.”Pinnick thanked the national teams’ major sponsor, AITEO, for its support, which he described as “unquantifiable” in these difficult times. The NFF chief noted that with the conclusion of the gaffer’s renewed contract, the federation was at liberty to re-channel its energies at bettering the senior team, adding: “I am convinced our football will only get better from here on.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
