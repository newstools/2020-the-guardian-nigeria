National President, Society of Gynaecology and Obstetrics of Nigeria (SGON), Professor Oluwarotimi Akinola has advised President Muhammadu Buhari to put pressure on state governors to raise the level of the fight against COVID-19 in their states.
  
The medical expert who expressed worries over claims by some governors that the pandemic has not got to their states, urged the Federal Government to exercise its power to ensure that tests are carried out in those states to determine their true status. Akinola disclosed this yesterday, during the public presentation of some Personal Protection Equipment (PPE), to the Lagos State government, by the state chapter of the SGON, at the state’s Medical Warehouse, Lekki. The items presented by the state chairman Dr. Joseph Akinde, his vice, Dr. Abidoye Gbadegesin and the Secretary, Dr. Kehinde Okunade, include 100 pieces of Protective Face Shield and 20 crates of Maltina drink. According to Akinde, the face shields were for medical personnel performing surgery on COVID-19 patients or those carrying out child delivery on COVID-19 patients. Akinde who lamented the rate of exposure and fatality of medical personnel, said it was of great concern to the state SGON, hence the move by the branch to make the donation to enhance their jobs and also save life. He said the society frowned at reports that some health workers were sent to treat COVID-19 patients without proper safety gears, noting that this amounts to sending soldiers to the war-front without arming them.
