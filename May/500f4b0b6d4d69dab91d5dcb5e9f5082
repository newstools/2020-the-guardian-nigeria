Two coronavirus patients who fled their isolation centre in Kaduna have been found and returned to their place of treatment. Kaduna State Government earlier on Sunday announced that it was working with security agencies to locate the patients. “Security agencies are tracking two persons who, after isolating in their homes pending receipt of their test results, fled their homes and have been incommunicado since being informed that they had tested positive and would be moved to the KDSG isolation centre for treatment,” Kaduna State health Baloni said in a statement on Sunday. Hours later, Balona confirmed that the patients have been found by security agents. “Security agencies have successfully tracked the two Covid-19 positive persons who fled their homes shortly after they were notified of their test results,” the government said quoting Balona. The government said Baloma also confirmed that both of them are now at the isolation centre where they will continue treatment for coronavirus.
