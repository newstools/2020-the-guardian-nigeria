According to him, “Kano positive cases still stance at 365 including eight deaths and three discharge. So far we have collected 313 samples, 182 tested at Abuja, 60 at AKTH and 71 confirmed at BUK test centres. So far we have 22.8 per cent of positive cases in Kano. “We are on contact tracing of over 400, 64 are without symptoms and 7 are positive. We still have the challenge of resistance and non-disclosure of status from our contacts. We are presently working on the instruction of the Governor to establish sample collections across the 44 local government areas of the state and that shall be achieved by the grace of God”. The coordinator called on the public to abide by the NCDC regulations on social distancing, intermittent hand sanitizing, personal hygiene and wearing of face mask to curb the spread of the disease in the state.
