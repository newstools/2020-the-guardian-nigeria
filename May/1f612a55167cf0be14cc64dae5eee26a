A recent report by WAKA Well by IOM X, has indicated that irregular migrants from Nigeria and other West African states faces various forms of violence, exploitation and other abuses along the Central Mediterranean route.
 
WAKA Well by IOM X is an International Organisation for Migration (IOM) working in Nigeria. According to the report irregular migration from Nigeria is mainly directed towards Europe through North Africa, with Nigerians almost exclusively using the Central Mediterranean route.
 
An estimated 84 per cent of migration within West Africa is towards another country in the region, which is seven times greater than migration flows from West Africa to other parts of the world. On regional migration, the report revealed that an estimated 7.5 million migrants move around West Africa.
