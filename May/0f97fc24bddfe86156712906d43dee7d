It was jubilation at Igbere, the hometown of Senator Orji Uzor Kalu, yesterday, following the reversal of the lower court’s verdict that sentenced him to 12 years imprisonment on December 5, last year for allegedly defrauding Abia State of N7.6billion during his eight-year reign as governor of the state. Reacting to the development, the traditional ruler of his Umusi-Igbere autonomous community, Eze Eme Ogbu, said: “We are excited, jubilating and looking forward to receiving him. We thank those that worked towards effecting the verdict.” An Igbo enthusiast, Ken Onwu, described the judgment as a rekindled hope for Igbo presidency in 2023. In his reaction, Chairman of the state All Progressives Congress (APC), Donatus Nwankpa, said: “The judgment would enable Kalu to continue his good service to his people. We expected this judgment because we knew he had a good case.” Kalu’s media aide for the Southeast, Maduka Okoro, stated that the judgment has thrown the zone into a festive mood, following what he called the travesty of justice delivered by the lower court. But immediate past chairman of the Umuahia branch of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), Mr. Nnamdi Eluwa, saw the verdict as seemingly defeating the law of natural justice, saying this would be established after details of the judgment are known, to see where the apex court based its judgment on the matter.
