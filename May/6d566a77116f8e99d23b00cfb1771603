So, the total number of confirmed cases in Oyo State is 143. “The company remains shut and will be decontaminated.

Special Adviser to Governor Seyi Makinde on Agricbusiness, Dr. Debo Akande, disclosed this while briefing newsmen at the end of the distribution of palliatives to some poorest households in Ibadan South-West Local Council of the state. He said the ongoing palliative distribution to identify 120 households across the state had no political undertone. The special adviser, who is also a member of the committee set up for the distribution, said the palliative was purely for the identified poorest of the poor in the society, irrespective of political party affiliations, adding that the second phase of the exercise would be for the identified 30,000 vulnerable households. He further stated that the palliative measure was in two ways, namely: the food distribution and agricultural inputs distribution to support farmers. He, therefore, said that 10,000 farmers would benefit from the support within the next two weeks. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
