Chaos, uncertainty and a possible feel of volatility were the basic descriptions of the atmosphere at the time of Senator Douye Diri’s “miraculous victory” in the governorship poll in Bayelsa State.
 
The days that followed contrasted sharply with the present. At a time many were predicting a descent into chaos, he worked to return stability to the state. And why not?
 
It’s said that when a leader seemingly divinely-enthroned comes along, a change in the status quo is expected. And Governor Diri made that change happen, in tune with his “no enemy” mentality in leadership, and the penchant to carry everyone along.  • Abanum writes from Yenagoa, Bayelsa State.
