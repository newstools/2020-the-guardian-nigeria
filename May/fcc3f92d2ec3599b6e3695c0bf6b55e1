Central Asia suffered the largest number of local attacks, according to Kaspersky’s antivirus solutions. At least 32% of devices in Tajikistan were exposed to malware, followed by Uzbekistan, with 31%. In China, Kaspersky detected malware in nearly 27% of the devices that use their software. The same month, Microsoft detected 6.5 million malware infections in different industries, although education was revealed as the main target, with 64% of attacks directed at this sector. Business and professional services came in second, with 9% of infections or 623 000 incidents. With nearly 540 000 cases, retail and consumer goods experienced 8% of all infections, while the financial and insurance services industry had 5% of malware infections globally, with Microsoft detecting nearly 330 000 cases in this sector. Hot on its heels is the healthcare industry with nearly 270 000 infections or 4%. Rachel Welsh, COO of Atlas VPN, says educational institutions were exposed to the largest number of malware attacks because criminals expect school staff or students are not well-trained in cyber security. “If schools are planning on holding exams remotely, they should prepare and get experienced IT specialists to check the systems out,” she advises.
