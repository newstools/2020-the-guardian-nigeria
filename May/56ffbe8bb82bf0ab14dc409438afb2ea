Kano State Government has finalized arrangement to distribute the Federal government palliatives to less privilege. The state government action came few hours after The Guardian reported how the same food items were abandoned in an open space and being hit by rain and sun. A statement issued by Commissioner for Information, Malam Garba, explained that the State Fundraising Committee on COVID-19 which is keeping the custody of the food items is finalizing arrangement to commence distribution of the 110 truck load of food items to poor families in the state. “We took into consideration that the rainy season has already set and took measures to protect the grains from getting destroyed by the prevailing hot weather occasioned by the scorching sun or rain by keeping them under waterproof tarpaulin,” the statement said. The commissioner noted that the committee has already completed the first phase of the distribution exercise of the distribution of palliatives donated by corporate organisations and individuals to the deserving households across the 484 political wards in the 44 local government areas of the state. He stressed that arrangement for the second phase of distribution of the palliative delivered by the federal government will commence soonest. Garba, however, did not clearly state when the second phase of distribution will begin. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
