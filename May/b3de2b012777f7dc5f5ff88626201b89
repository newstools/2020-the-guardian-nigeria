The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), has called for active collaboration of the public and private sector to tackle the health and economic crisis bedevilling the country and the world at large.
   
CBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele, said the nation’s economy is currently exposed to triple shocks of supply, demand and revenue driven primarily by the crash in crude oil prices between January and May.
   
He pointed out that effective private sector collaboration with federal and state governments is needed to preserve the lives of the people and restore economic activity.  He said once the vaccine is validated by the health authorities, the CBN will step in and do the needful, saying: “Our objective is to improve the capacity of our health system to address emerging public health challenges.
 
“This requires that we all come together to support the work of the presidential task force in its determination to save lives and stem the pandemic. “It is in this regard that I would like to commend the Nigerian private sector, who have come together under the Coalition against COVID-19 (CA-COVID), to support the government, by raising funds to procure needed Isolation Centres, medical equipment among others.
 
“So far, the CA-COVID-19 has raised up to N27billion to fund these initiatives.  These donations are being used to build well equipped isolation centres across the 36 states of the federation,” he added.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
