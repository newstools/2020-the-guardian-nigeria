As contained in the “Measuring Digital Development: ICT Price Trends 2019” report of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), the global analysis of prices for mobile-voice, mobile-data and fixed-broadband services suggests that affordability is not the only barrier to Internet uptake.
   
ITU observed that on average, prices for mobile-voice, mobile-data and fixed-broadband services are decreasing steadily around the world and in some countries even dramatically.  It pointed out that the global average price of a mobile-data basket of 1.5 GB shrank from 8.4 per cent of GNI per capita in 2013 to 3.2 per cent in 2019, at a compound yearly growth rate of almost -15 per cent. When expressed in USD, the global average price of a mobile-data basket of at least 1.5 GB dropped by 7 per cent on average annually between 2013 and 2019. According to it, good progress has been made towards the Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development’s target of achieving affordable broadband costing 2-5 per cent of GNI per capita by 2025, but still more remains to be done. There are still nine developing countries and 31 LDCs that have yet to reach the 2 per cent target by 2025.
  
ITU submitted that Fixed-broadband packages remain generally more expensive than mobile-data packages (although data allowances are not always directly comparable). Over the past four years, the affordability of fixed broadband has not changed substantially, but advertised download speeds continue to increase.
