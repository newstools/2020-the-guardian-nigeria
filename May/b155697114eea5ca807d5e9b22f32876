As part of measures to check and prevent the spread of Coronavirus in Akwa Ibom state, the Conglomerate of Health Professionals in the state has commenced street and market sensitization. The conglomeration is made up of the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA), National Association Of Nigerian Nurses and Midwives (NANNM), Pharmaceutical Society Of Nigeria (PSN) and Association of Medical Laboratory Scientists Of Nigeria (AMLSN). Addressing newsmen in Uyo yesterday on behalf of the health professionals, the Chairman of the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) Dr Nsikak Nyoyoko said that, they were poised to embark on the sensitisation as the coronavirus in the state keeps rising. He said that to avoid community spread of coronavirus infections, there was a need to create awareness on the mode of transmission and precautionary measures to the people at the grassroots. According to him, the sensitisation train would berth at Eket local government council and would move to Ikot Ekpene on May 30th and ended at Oron on May 31st. He explained that the health workers had an earlier sensitised market and selected streets within Uyo Metropolis. “We want to take the campaign to our market women and those in the streets, who may not be listening to television and radio campaigns. During the sensitisation period, we will share face masks and distribute hand sanitizers to the people. “This is also part of our contributions to contain the spread of coronavirus pandemic in the state,” he said. He said that apart from sharing of face masks to the people, the conglomerate has also recorded jingles in five different local languages which would be played in nook and crannies as the sensitisation convoy moves. Nyoyoko added that, by these efforts, the health Professionals hope to improve the understanding of the pandemic by the masses and also ensure the protection of the people.
