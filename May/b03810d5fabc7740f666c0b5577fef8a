Oil and Gas Free Zones Authority (OGFZA), has restated its commitment to continue to abide by directives from the Nigerian Export Processing Zone Authority (NEPZA), as well the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment. “We will continue to act in accordance with the directives given by the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investments as well as NEPZA because they are our regulators.” The declaration comes on the heels of recent action taken by oil and gas firms operating in the Free Zones, seeking judicial intervention in the regulation of operations within the Snake Island Integrated Zones. In a statement made available to journalists yesterday, in Abuja, the counsel to the firms, Qudus Mumumey, said the case had already become a court issue since 2008. Mumurney called on the Attorney General of the Federation to interpret the Act establishing NEPZA and OGFZA, to further clarify the issues at stake.
