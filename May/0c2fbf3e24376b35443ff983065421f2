Nigerian Presidency late Tuesday denied reports that President Muhammadu Buhari has cancelled appointments and memos approved by his former chief of staff late Abba Kyari. “The attention of the Presidency has been drawn to media reports alleging that President Muhammadu Buhari has cancelled a number of memos and appointments signed off by his former Chief of Staff,” presidential spokesman Garba Shehu said in a statement. “Not surprisingly, these reports have quoted unnamed sources.” The Guardian on Sunday reported  that Buhari may have directed his Kyari’s successor Ibrahim Agboola Gambari to cancel all appointments and approvals made by the late chief of staff without his permission. Presidential spokesmen – Femi Adesina and Shehu declined comments when asked by our correspondent to clarify reasons behind the reported cancellation of about 150 memos discovered to have bewn approved by the late Kyari without Buhari’s consent. “I’ve seen your text, I’ve seen your text,” Adesina told our correspondent without admitting or refuting the report. However, after over 48 hours, Shehu said the report should be ignored. “There is not a grain of truth in these reports and Nigerians should please ignore the insinuations behind them,” Shehu said. He stated that Buhari has never and will not cede the power given to him by Nigerians to anyone else. Shehu did not speak on the recent probe reportedly ordered by Buhari on the activities of the late chief of staff who died of coronavirus in April.
