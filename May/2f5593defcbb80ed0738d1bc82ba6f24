Zulum engages 28 Borno communities for food security Adamawa State House of Assembly (ADHA) has approved a N17 billion loan facility requested by Governor Ahmadu Fintiri for the execution of certain critical projects in the state. Fintiri had sought ADHA’s approval to obtain the loan from two commercial banks for execution of projects across the 21 councils of the state. The request was contained in two separate letters and read at the resumed plenary presided over by the Speaker, Aminu Abbas. According to the letters, the state government will obtain N15 billion from Fidelity Bank to pay back within 48 months at 13 per cent interest rate and 0.5 per cent management fee. The governor added that another N2 billion would be sought from Access Bank at a tenure of 10 months at 4.5 per cent interest rate up to February 2021 and nine per cent interest rate from March 1, 2021. He said, “The N2 billion loan facility is at the instance of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) extended to all the 36 states of the federation to fight COVID-19.” If approved, the loan would be used to build and expand healthcare facilities and acquire medical equipment, the governor had said. The letters promptly referred to the standing committee on finance, budget and appropriation headed by Kate Raymond Mamuno for consideration. Meanwhile, Borno State Governor Babagana Zulum has engaged communities on the shores of Lake Alau to achieve food security. The decade-long Boko Haram terrorism interrupted farming activities, as farmers were killed on their farmlands. The 28 farming communities are located in Konduga and Jere councils of the state. Zulum announced the food security initiatives on Tuesday while interacting with farming communities taking refuge around Lake Alau. On how to achieve food security, Zulum said: “Today’s visit of farming communities on shores of the lake was to achieve food security in the state.” “This administration is targeting about 28 communities along the shores of Lake Alau in the first phase of the back-to-farm initiatives.” During the visit, the governor personally interacted with farmers that were either clearing the farms or planting. “Our intention is to resettle all the 28 communities around this place. We have built trenches from Dalori village to Molai community. We are currently in consultation with the military, God willing, to return all Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) to their localities before the end of this year “I assure the people of government’s support to enable farmers go back to their farmlands. This singular act will make our people happy and food sufficient.” However, the Commander of 251 Task Force Battalion awarded the governor a medal in appreciation of his support to the military.
