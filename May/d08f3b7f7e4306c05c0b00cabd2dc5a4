• Says educational institutions remain closed, religious gathering still banned
• Tasks banks, corporate organisations on premises decontamination Ogun State Governor Dapo Abiodun has extended the total lockdown in the state for another one week. He said that while the lockdown ends May 9, 2020, relaxation windows remain Monday, May 4; Wednesday, May 6 and Friday, May 8. The governor, who disclosed this at the weekend while delivering his address on the update of COVID-19 situation in the state, said that the new time-frame would, however, now be from 7:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. He said: “This will give our people ample time to conduct necessary economic activities and to get to their various homes before the commencement of the daily curfew as directed by the President. “For the avoidance of doubt, the curfew is from 8:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. everyday and will be strictly enforced.” “All public religious gathering remain banned. “Any assembly of more than 15 persons remains banned till further notice. Also, all pubs, clubs, stadia, public pools, spas, gyms, salons remain closed.” However, he said restaurants might open on the approved days for take-out meals only. The governor, who explained that in the last few weeks, the number of confirmed cases in Ogun State had continued to rise to more than double, said that eight patients had been discharged and there were 47 active cases currently receiving treatment. He, therefore, reassured the people that there is no reason for panic, saying: “The fact that we are having increased number of confirmed cases is a confirmation that we are doing the right things. “The increase in the number of cases is because of our increased testing capacity and faster turnaround.” Abiodun, who disclosed that most of the new cases arise from the influx of immigrants into the state, emphasised that the use of face-masks is now compulsory in public places. The governor also explained that COVID-19 task force had met with market leaders to set up COVID-19 enforcement committees in various markets to enforce physical distancing, use of face-masks and the deployment of hand-washing facilities and hand sanitisers at strategic locations within the markets. Meanwhile, the state government has urged corporate organisations, banks, industries, large and small-scale enterprises to decontaminate their premises as precautionary measures. The state’s Commissioner for Environment, Abiodun Abudu-Balogun, in a statement yesterday in Abeokuta said that the move became expedient due to large volume of customers and visitors that throng their premises for transactions. He said that the directive would also complement the state government’s efforts at flattening the curve of the pandemic in the state. He also urged them to enforce wearing of face-masks by their workers and visitors, keeping social distance and provision of hand washing materials and sanitisers.
