The outgoing State Working Committee (SWC) of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Ekiti chapter, has welcomed the composition of a caretaker committee to take over the chapter’s affairs pending the conduct of state congress election. It noted that the term of the SWC expires May 10, which necessitated composition of a Caretaker Committee to pilot the party’s affairs. It said the SWC was neither dissolved nor sacked, saying the leadership only acted in line with the party’s Constitution. The party’s National Working Committee had in a statement by its National Organising Secretary, Col. Austin Akobundu (rtd), on Friday announced the composition of a Caretaker Committee in Ekiti. The seven-man caretaker committee, chaired by former Senate Deputy Chief Whip and former lawmaker representing Oyo North, Senator Hosea Agboola, has Mr. Yinka Akerele, Hon. Samuel Omotosho, Hon. Tunji Odeyemi, Hon. Adeyemi Abiodun Sunday and Ariyo Afolabi, as members, while Hon. Diran Odeyemi is to serve as committee secretary. The outgoing State Publicity Secretary, Jackson Adebayo, said the party acted in order not to create a vacuum in the party’s leadership position in Ekiti. On the crisis of confidence trailing the ward congress that had factionalised the PDP along pro-Ayodele Fayose and Senator Biodun Olujimi’s lines, Adebayo said the court would resolve the crisis.
