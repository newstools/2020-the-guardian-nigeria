Yung L has enlisted Nigerian international pop star, Wizkid on the remix of Eve Bounce a summer-ready bop off his “Juice and Zimm” EP. “Eve Bounce Remix” comes to us after a fortuitous social media exchange between both musicians about making some quarantine music. Akon Features Wizkid On New Song “Escape” <img src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Yung-L-ft-Wizkid--598x598.jpg" alt="" width="598" height="598" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1161151 lazyload" /> On the remix, the glinting sounds that open the original song are thickened to allow Yung L lay a typical emotive verse over the soft thrumming beat. His ode to the muse is tinged with attraction and want, rightly explaining his desires. By the time Wizkid, who released the decade closing Soundman Vol 1 E.P. last December, gets to splash his vocals on the song, the ambience is slowed down for a markedly refined expression of interest that allows dancehall and afrobeats to find a spot of confluence without watering down their elements.
