 Francis Uzoho  Speaking with a team of journalists on Wednesday, things have not been easy for African goalkeepers abroad, adding they have to work harder than European counterparts before being considered for first-team shirts. “Africa has not produced many outstanding goalkeepers comparable to the quality of outfield players over the years and so the European managers prefer their home-bred goalkeepers. “European players and coaches have more respect for African players than they do for goalkeepers. They wouldn’t trust you until you continue proving them wrong. That is why I work on myself to be in good shape regularly.” The goalkeeper, who picked Vincent Enyeama, David de Gea, Manuel Neuer and Jan Oblak as his role models, disclosed that he was still recuperating from the injury he copped in a friendly match against Brazil last year, assuring his fans that he would be back to full football action very soon. Uzoho pledged to continue giving his best for the Super Eagles and also excel in his club engagements, saying that playing against such superstars as Lionel Messi and Higuain on his debut at the World Cup has given the desire to want to remain in the top league. “Playing at the World Cup for the first time as a first choice goalkeeper came as a grace to me. “In fact, the day Nigeria played against Argentina was my best day in the game because I stood on the same field with Messi and Higuain, players I respect a lot. “I had to control my excitement as a professional keeper to give my best in the game,” he confessed. Uzoho, who argued that the Super Eagles performed well at the Egypt 2019 African Nations Cup, where Nigeria won the bronze medal, said the team would get better if top quality friendly matches were arranged for them.
