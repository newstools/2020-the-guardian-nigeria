  Six health workers in Plateau State have tested positive for the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Commissioner for Health, Dr. Nimkong Lar, disclosed yesterday that the six persons did not have any contact with any COVID-19 patient at the isolation centres. Also, a pregnant woman in an observation centre at Heipang, who submitted herself willingly, has been delivered of a girl after spending 10 days in the centre. Out of the 86 COVID-19 cases recorded in the state, 27 have so far been discharged while two died. The commissioner said the two persons died before the result of their diagnosis came out. Lar reiterated the need for the public to observe respiratory hygiene, physical distancing and the use of face masks, to avoid contracting the virus. According to him, the woman and the baby are in a good condition of health and will soon be discharged, as the woman has tested negative for the virus. The Heipang Observation Centre has 42 inmates who are in two categories; those who violated the lockdown regulations that would be charged to court and those who submitted themselves to be observed by the centre, the commissioner added. Centre Coordinator, David Dama, said the expectant woman submitted herself for observation and spent 10 days at the centre before she gave birth to a girl under the care of nurses and a doctor. “The woman in question presented herself here personally to be quarantined because she returned from a business trip outside the state and she felt like following the due process of being quarantined and observed for the period of 14 days,” Dama explained.
