Knowles-Lawson during her appearance on Thursday’s episode of Tamron Hall revealed that she’s hoping for a big in-person reunion after the family tested negative for COVID-19. “We all got tested,” she shared. “We’ve gotten the results back and everybody is okay, and so I hope we can get together this Mother’s Day and have dinner together — and I can actually touch them for real.” The 66-year-old is grandmother to Beyonce’s eight-year-old daughter Blue Ivy and two-year-old twins Rumi and Sir, as well as Solange’s 15-year-old son Daniel Jr, and Knowles-Lawson admitted that not seeing her grandchildren during the pandemic makes her sad, “especially on Sundays because that’s the day that we all get together. So on Sunday mornings, I’ve got the blues.” She also offered her own mothering tips ahead of the mother’s day celebration, saying: “My best advice would be that you can’t raise kids and have the philosophy of – Do as I say and not as I do – because they are watching everything you do. So the best advice I can give you is be what you want them to be. You practice what you want them to be.” Tina Knowles-Lawson is partnering with her daughter, Beyoncé’s philanthropy initiative BeyGOOD this Mother’s Day weekend for a new campaign, #IDIDMYPART, which encourages those in Houston to get tested for COVID-19 as a way to slow the spread of the virus. The mobile testing relief campaign will bring in medical centre staffers to administer 1,000 free tests. Along with free test kits, the initiative will provide residents with essential vitamins, household supplies and personal protective equipment.
