Prominent Bayelsa political leaders and elders have reiterated their support for the former governor of the state Seriake Dickson to fill the vacant slot of Bayelsa West Senatorial district in the Nigerian Senate. The leaders and elders, in a statement signed by the former commissioner, former chairman Governing Council, Federal Polytechnic, Ekowe, Etiffa Bekeakpo and former senior special assistant to President Jonathan on Household and Domestic Matters, Sylbriks Obiriki on Thursday, said that the political leaders after extensive deliberations decided to choose Dickson because of his track record and commitment to promoting the interest of the Ijaw nation. The elders said that the former governor was the best candidate for the Senatorial slot and should be supported by all to fill the vacant position. They, therefore, called on the people of Sagbama and Ekeremor to support the former governor in the bid for the Bayelsa West Senatorial slot in the National Assembly. Etiffa and Obriki added that the former Governor gave the necessary attention to the projection of critical issues of concern to the Ijaw nation such as Resource Control and restructuring in the past. “The Senate is the highest law-making body in Nigeria, therefore, you need a man like the Honourable Henry Dickson who understands the politics of the country who has a vast knowledge in law-making having served as a member of the House of Representatives. “He has made his marks in governance and has proved to be a tested leader with an incontrovertible interest in the development of our society. “He has the experience and the capacity to articulate the issues affecting Bayelsa, the Ijaw nation the Niger Delta and Nigeria. He has done it before and is trusted to do it again.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
