Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike has been advised to work with the University of PortHarcourt Teaching Hospital (UPTH) and its Chief Medical Director, Prof. Henry Ugboma, to expedite testing and containment measures against the spread of coronavirus in the state.
 
A chieftain of the state chapter of All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief Eze Chukwuemeka Eze, who gave the advice in a statement made available to The Guardian, also condemned the governor’s sudden decision to lift the lockdown in the state to allow his party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), to inaugurate its state executive committee.
 
Describing as hypocrisy the relaxation of the lockdown just to allow PDP inaugurate its State Executive Council and to organise a Thanksgiving service today, Eze dismissed Wike’s claim that the measure was to give any respite to the suffering masses.
