The unnamed Russian woman was working on a Covid-19 ward, treating only male patients in a hospital in Tula according to a report by The Mirror. The image quickly went viral, as she can be seen wearing matching black bra and knickers as she writes a patient’s chart. However, hospital chiefs were not amused and punished the nurse for “non-compliance with the requirements for medical clothing”. The nurse, in her 20s, said she was “too hot” wearing her nurses’ uniform under the gown. She told her managers at Tula Regional Clinical Hospital that she did not realise the PPE she wore when treating coronavirus patients was so transparent. The regional health ministry said: A disciplinary sanction was applied to the nurse of the infectious diseases department who violated (uniform) requirements. Her chiefs at first said the woman was wearing “lingerie” but later claimed she had a “swimming suit” beneath the gown. The nurse has not spoken publicly on the incident and the exact details of the disciplinary action were not revealed. One patient said there was no objection from men in the coronavirus ward while admitting there was “some embarrassment”.
