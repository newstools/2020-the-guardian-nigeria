The military high command has assured that measures are being emplaced to ensure that armed bandits do not escape from states where the armed forces and other security agencies are conducting various operations to other states. Following the military onslaught and intensified offensive against bandits in the North West and North Central parts of the country by the military, there are concerns that displaced bandits could move their base to other states. The military said all current operations are in synergy with the ongoing operations in the North West to block inter-state movement of bandits within the North West and North Central zones. Coordinator, Defence Media Operations, Defence Headquarters, Maj-Gen. John Enenche, disclosed at a press conference yesterday in Abuja, that air assets had also been deployed to cover Kaduna, Niger, Nasarawa and Kogi states. Enenche said, “There are worries from some quarters in the North West and North Central parts of the country that armed bandits could escape from states where the Armed Forces of Nigeria (AFN) and other security agencies are conducting various operations at the moment, to other states. “In this regard, the high command of the Nigerian military hereby assures all concerned that proactive measures are in place to handle such occurrences. “I am to affirm that the AFN is totally committed to tackling all the security challenges in the country until normalcy is restored. Hence, the public is requested to continue to provide credible information to the military.” According to him, Nigerian troops operating in various theatres across the country recorded tremendous successes from May 6 to 28, 2020. “In Operation Lafiya Dole, several of the Boko Haram Terrorists (BHT)/ Islamic State’s West Africa Province (ISWAP) fighters and senior commanders were neutralised and their facilities, gun trucks and other structures destroyed. “Within the period under review, a total of 188 BHT/ISWAP fighters were killed and several others suffered various degrees of gunshot wounds with narrow chances of survival. This is in addition to several others killed in air bombardments. The troops of Operation Lafiya Dole also rescued several civilians – women and children, who were abducted by the terrorists. The total number rescued within this period is 236. The victims have undergone medical checks and treatments at our health facilities.” He also spoke of Operation Whirl Punch which killed 19 armed bandits in Benue and Taraba states. “The gallant troops also carried out a raid on a hide-out off Zaki Biam and Katsina-Ala highway where a notorious armed robber, Terugwa Igbagwa (alias Orjondu), was killed. “Troops also recovered large cache of arms and ammunition within the period under review. The killing of Orjondu brought great relief to the people of Benue and some parts of Taraba. He was the mastermind of various civilian deaths including kidnapping and assassinations. Equally, notorious militia leader, Gana, narrowly escaped with injuries when his hide-out was raided. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
