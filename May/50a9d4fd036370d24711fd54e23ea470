 Traffic at Lagos secretariat PHOTO: Gbenga Salau  This led to a spillover from the Lagos State Secretariat gate to as far as Shoprite and Governors. It also led to obstructing other road users, with some chaotic traffic along the corridor. A motorist, Segun Johnson wondered why the checkpoint to verify civil servant going into the secretariat would disturb other road users. “This does not show leadership on the part of the person or persons in charge. I hope they will be called to order and deploy a better strategy not to have a repeat tomorrow. This is not fair to other road users. I spent over ten minutes to drive through for a journey that should take less than a minute,” Johnson said. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
