Bjornsson, 31, broke the previous record held by Eddie Hall in 2016 for lifting 500 kilograms (1,102 pounds). On Saturday, Bjornsson lifted 1,104 pounds (501 kilograms) at Thor’s Power Gym in Iceland. The actor and strongman completed the lift as the barbell bent and strained under the weights. He held the lift for two seconds before letting go and roaring in delight. On Instagram, he said; “I have no words. What an amazing day, one I will remember for the rest of my life. I said I was coming for it, and once I set my mind on something, I’m a dog with a bone. I want to give a huge shoutout to my family, friends, coaches, fans, sponsors and haters, all of whom helped this lift be possible.”   A post shared by Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson (@thorbjornsson) on May 2, 2020 at 11:30am PDT  Bjornsson, who is 6 feet 9 inches tall and weighs 452 pounds had won the World’s Strongest Man competition in 2018 and has earned third place or higher every year since 2012.
