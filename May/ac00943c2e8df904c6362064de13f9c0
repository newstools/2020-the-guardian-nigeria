One hundred and thirty people have tested positive for the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) at accommodation for asylum seekers in western Germany, officials said on Monday. A spokeswoman for the district government of Cologne said that the remaining 170 residents at the shelter in the town of St. Augustin, around 30km  south-east of Cologne, have been confirmed negative in tests. “As in all state accommodation facilities, the highest hygiene standards are being implemented,’’ she said. According to the spokeswoman, the residents are now being housed separately, depending on their test results, with outdoor areas also segregated. Asylum seekers have been instructed to eat only in their rooms. In order to reduce numbers at the facility, where families and individuals in the early process of applying for asylum in Germany are housed, some who tested negative have been relocated to other accommodation. The state of North Rhine Westphalia, where St Augustin is located, has already seen two major COVID-19 outbreaks at refugee accommodation facilities.
