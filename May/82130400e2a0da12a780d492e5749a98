During an Instagram Live session on Monday, Boosie claimed that he was “preparing” his son and his nephews by letting a “grown woman” perform oral sex on them when they were about the age of 12 and 13. “I’m training these boys right, I’m training these boys right Ask any of my nephews, ask any of them, ask my son. Yeah, when they was 12, 13 they got head. Yeah, that’s how it’s supposed to be. Hell yeah I got my fuckin’ son d**k sucked. You f**kin’ right. Yes, a grown woman, grown, super grown … checked his as* out. Checked all my nephews out, super grown. Is she grown? She check me out. I know what the f**k she did to them, she checked me out, that b**ch. I’m getting them prepared, man.” Boosie also claimed he had shown his son how to put on a condom when he was only 9 or 10 years old: “Yes, that’s how I raised them. I don’t care what y’all say,” he continued. The rapper stated that what he did for his son is better than having kids watch cartoons as they can be exposed to homosexual content. “It’s better than watching cartoons. That’s why they have iPhone 11s. They can watch as much porn as they want. It’s better than them watching cartoons with two men kissing … Yeah, it’s like that. Yeah, we raise them different … That’s just how it is.” Born Torrence Hatch Jr., Boosie began rapping in the 1990s as a member of the hip hop collective Concentration Camp, eventually pursuing a solo career in 2000 with the release of his debut album Youngest of da Camp. After leaving the label the following year, he signed with Pimp C’s Trill Entertainment to release his second studio album, For My Thugz. In total, Hatch has gone on to release seven solo studio albums, as well as six collaborative albums and numerous mixtapes. The comments triggered a wave of backlash on social media, with many accusing the rapper of facilitating child sexual abuse.     In February, Boosie was equally under fire for his comment on Dwayne Wade’s 12-year-old child Zaya who came out as a transgender girl.
“Don’t dress him as a woman, dawg. He’s 12 years old. He’s not up there yet. He hasn’t made his final decisions yet. Don’t cut his f***ing d**k off, Dwyane Wade,” the rapper said in an Instagram post.
