 Adolphus Godwin Karibi-Whyte PHOTO:Facebook  President Buhari prayed that God will comfort all who mourn the legal colossus, especially his family, the academia, Nigerian Bar Association and Body of Benchers, friends and associates, commending his contributions to law and jurisprudence in the country, and beyond, leaving a legacy of integrity and nationalism. President Buhari noted, with deep conviction, that the legal luminary used his knowledge, wisdom and experience in serving the nation he loved so much, working diligently as a scholar for many years, before transiting to the judiciary, and pursuing his passion of ensuring fairness through the Federal Revenue Court, Court of Appeal and Supreme Court of Nigeria. The President affirmed that Justice Karibi-Whyte played many historic roles in growing Nigeriaâ€™s legal system,  strengthening democratic institutions and shaping the policy direction of many governments and international agencies, as he served as Chairman, Nigerian Constitutional Conference, 1994-1995, Counterfeit Currency Tribunal, Nigerian Institute of Advanced Legal Studies, Committee of Pro-Chancellors of State-Owned Universities, and Judge and Vice-President of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia at The Hague. The President, in a statement signed by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina on Saturday, said the erudite jurist lived and led by example, set a standard for resourcefulness and patriotism, and brought honour to the country, praying that God will grant his soul a peaceful rest.
