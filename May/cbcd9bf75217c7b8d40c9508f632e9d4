The President, Nigerian Society of Engineers (NSE), Babagana Mohammed has warned that if there is no action plan for post COVID-19 in Nigeria, the economy could experience worst crisis situation.
     
Mohammed observed that the Coronavirus pandemic has plunged the world into difficult situation, as many companies have been affected and may not recover in the near future. 
   
This, he said, poses a bleak future for citizens, as they could face harsh economic situation. Saying that Engineering plays a key role in curbing the virus, as equipment needed for the treatment of COVID-19 are expensive, he urged government to start manufacturing equipment locally to save cost. He said: “Ventilators are very expensive, and the international community has recently stopped exporting such materials. So, it is time for Nigeria to start producing such equipment. There are a lot of innovations across the nation by engineers, ranging from ventilators, specialised hand washing and sanitiser equipment, among others. We want to gather people with similar products to break down the cost and make it more efficient.” 
   
He said government should show willingness to work with Nigerian engineers, and that the nation needs to implement many laws to provide support to them.
   
“There is a lot to be done. I have been receiving messages from my engineers, and I have told them that if they don’t create jobs for themselves, they shouldn’t expect others to do so. It is our duty as engineers to create jobs for others,” he added. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
