In our opinion, the recovery in share prices is driven by rebalancing in the oil market which has resulted in a 94 per cent rebound in oil prices from $18 per barrel to about $35 per barrel within a month; increasing indications that governments around the world will reopen their economies regardless of the anxiety around COVID-19; cheap market valuation of high quality stocks; sustained dividend declaration by corporates, translating into attractive dividend yield amid poor rates on T-bills and sizable market liquidity.” Further breakdown of yesterday’s trading showed that the uptrend was impacted by gains recorded in large and medium capitalised stocks, amongst which are; Mobil Nigeria, BUA Cement, Unilever Nigeria, Guinness Nigeria and Zenith Bank.
