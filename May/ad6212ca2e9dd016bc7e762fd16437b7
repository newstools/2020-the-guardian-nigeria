Mr. Chinedu Anujuru, owner of the collapsed eight-storey building under construction in Owerri, Imo State, has called on the state government to set up a judicial panel of enquiry to determine the remote cause of the incident, adding that the estimated cost of the project, when completed, is at N4.8 billion. Speaking to newsmen in Owerri through his counsel, Soronnadi Njoku, Anujuru said the panel would ensure transparency and a fair hearing for him and other parties involved in the matter. He appealed to the government not be in a haste to pass judgment on the matter, insisting that he obtained necessary approvals from relevant quarters and also engaged competent consultant, professional architects, engineers and builders for the project. The France-based businessman, who expressed regrets over the incident, especially the loss of lives, stated that how the government handles the probe would serve as a litmus test to both local and foreign investors on how their investments will be treated in the event of any misfortune. He disclosed that prior to the collapse, he received no complaints either from the consultants, the contractors or officials of the Owerri Capital Development Authority (OCDA) in relation to anything that could jeopardize the project. It would be recalled that on April 30, the hotel still under construction collapsed leading to the loss of lives and leaving many others injured.
