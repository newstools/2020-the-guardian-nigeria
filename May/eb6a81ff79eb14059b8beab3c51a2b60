Frenchman Zidane led Madrid to three Champions League titles in his first tenure at the helm of the club and hopes to win something in his first full season back in charge. “After almost 60 days everyone is happy to get back here and catch up with each other, and to play some football, which is what they all love,” said Zidane. “We’ll do everything to be ready for the restart and with eleven games to go we want to give it absolutely everything to win something.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
