The People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in Ilaje council of Ondo State has endorsed Mr. Banji Okunomo as the consensus governorship candidate to vie in the October 10, 2020 guber poll in the state. This was contained in a statement signed and made available to journalists in Akure, yesterday, by the council secretary of the party, Evangelist Banjo Ikunogbon and other executive members across the 12 wards. According to him, the party leadership in the council had set up reconciliation committee to pacify all aggrieved persons, saying they must sheathe their swords in the interest of the council. Ikunogbon disclosed that 21 party executives and other 35 ward executives in the council preferred the former chairman of the council and state publicity secretary of the party, Okunomo, above other aspirants. He reaffirmed their support for the PDP guber aspirant, who would slug it out with other aspirants from other local governments, dismissing an allegation that some of the executive members had withdrawn their support. Ikunogbon urged party members across the 12 wards to support the sole candidacy of Okunomo in order to win the upcoming governorship primary. He said: “We only exercised our constitutional rights of freedom of expression as to who we think could win the ticket of the party and eventually defeat Akeredolu in the upcoming governorship election in Ondo State. “Our endorsement is not an embargo against any of the aspirants in the upcoming PDP primaries. Politics is a game of number. Simple majority will always prevail and that’s the beauty of democracy.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
