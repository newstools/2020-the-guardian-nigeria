Naturally, healthy skin has a 10-20% water content, but when it falls short, it starts getting dry and flaky. Flaky skin occurs when the protective natural oil produced by the skin begins to dry up. As a result, water loss in dry skin is 75 times greater than normal skin. As the skin loses both oil (sebum) and water, the skin begins to dry out and its topmost surface dies and begins to peel away, usually in very small, thin slivers called flakes. This flaking can also be caused by several other factors such as weather changes, eczema, bacterial and fungal infections, among other things. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-1155648 size-full lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Uru-Eke-at-the-2018-AMVCA.-Photo-Layefa-Beauty.jpg" alt="" width="1080" height="1079" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Uru-Eke-at-the-2018-AMVCA.-Photo-Layefa-Beauty.jpg 1080w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Uru-Eke-at-the-2018-AMVCA.-Photo-Layefa-Beauty-599x598.jpg 599w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Uru-Eke-at-the-2018-AMVCA.-Photo-Layefa-Beauty-100x100.jpg 100w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Uru-Eke-at-the-2018-AMVCA.-Photo-Layefa-Beauty-200x200.jpg 200w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Uru-Eke-at-the-2018-AMVCA.-Photo-Layefa-Beauty-487x487.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Uru-Eke-at-the-2018-AMVCA.-Photo-Layefa-Beauty-974x973.jpg 974w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Uru-Eke-at-the-2018-AMVCA.-Photo-Layefa-Beauty-240x240.jpg 240w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Uru-Eke-at-the-2018-AMVCA.-Photo-Layefa-Beauty-480x480.jpg 480w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Uru-Eke-at-the-2018-AMVCA.-Photo-Layefa-Beauty-600x600.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /> It can be differentiated from a red rash with blisters or from scales (a raised, firm area that resembles fish scales) by the way it looks.
However, to get rid of this unpleasant feeling on the skin and get back to having radiant glowing skin, here are simple tips you can apply: 1. Use a Gentle Cleanser When choosing a cleanser for dry skin, make sure to use one that is gentle and one that will not strip the skin of its natural moisture. Target alcohol-free cleansers; most facial washes and foaming cleansers often include ingredients such as alcohol that pull out moisture, making you even drier. Choose cleansers that are milky in texture, one that will absorb easily and is not too irritating. 2. Use Lightweight Products <img class="aligncenter wp-image-1155647 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Lightweight-foundation.-Photo-Pinterest-896x598.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="854" /> As much as you want to keep your skin moisturised adequately, clogging pores is still something to pay attention to. Try to purchase products – face products, cosmetics – that are not extremely thick and heavy. Heavy foundation, for example, can cause dry patches to become much more noticeable than a more lightweight foundation would. 3. Mix Moisturiser with Foundation
As much it is advised to always ensure to keep your skin moisturised, you can also adopt the method of mixing your foundation with a very small amount of moisturizer. Place a small dot of moisturizer on the back of your hand along with your foundation. Mix it with a foundation brush or your finger. This will allow your foundation to be less heavy, and your foundation will apply much easier and more smoothly. Additionally, it can give your face an added bit of moisture. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-1155649 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/A-moisturiser.-Photo-Pinterest-598x598.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="1280" /> 4. Exfoliate Gently
If you’re simply experiencing red and scaly flakes due to dry, sensitive skin, less is more! Exfoliating can be an effective way of removing dead skin cells that lead to flaking, but you must be careful. The key is to be gentle with your skin, otherwise, you may cause further dryness and irritation. Instead of using harsh scrubs, opt for a microfiber towel (gently buff in circular motions) to exfoliate after cleansing. Stick to exfoliating no more than once per week (especially if you are sensitive), and always follow with a moisturiser. Until your flaky skin shows signs of improvement, make sure you avoid products like;
• Chemical exfoliants such as salicylic, glycolic or other alpha hydroxy acids which dry out the skin in most cases and face scrubs that contain charcoal, sugar, beads, or any other rough ingredients. These face scrubs can further disrupt the skin barrier if it is already dry and flaky.
• Harsh cleansers that typically target oily skin because they are more likely to contain drying ingredients. 5. Avoid Hot Showers
Now is not the time to long for hot, relaxing showers as it won’t do your skin any good. They may feel good, but super-hot water can damage the skin barrier, leading to dry skin and flaking. Rather, shower with lukewarm temperatures and limiting showers to no more than 10 to 15 minutes. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-1155646 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Best-retinol-products.-Photo-The-Independent-797x598.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="960" /> 6. Tone Down Acne Treatments
Classic acne-fighters like benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, and retinoid products can be super-effective in treating stubborn pimples, but they can also strip the skin of oil and cause dryness, flaking or even result to peeling. Everyone’s skin is different, so you may have to carry out a patch test to find it out how your skin reacts first, in order to find an effective routine that doesn’t cause irritation.
In general, aim to use your acne treatment products every other day—but if you notice dry skin on your face, cut back to once every three days, and make sure you use one of these hydrating moisturisers for acne-prone skin after application.
