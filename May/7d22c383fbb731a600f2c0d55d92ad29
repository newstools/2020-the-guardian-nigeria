Biafran flag PHOTO: Getty images Cross River State government has warned the Movement for Actualisation of Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB) to desist from any act of treason. MASSOB leader in Cross River and Akwa Ibom States, Mr Mike Effiong, had at weekend inaugurated parliaments in the two States to mark the 21st anniversary of the struggle for a sovereign Biafra state. The parliaments according to Effiong are located in Calabar, Akpabuyo, Akamkpa, in Cross River and Ikot Ekpene, Oruk Anan, Uyo, Eket and Abak in Akwa Ibom state as the action of the regional leadership of the group was in line with the peaceful means to self actualisation of MASSOB as directed by Chief Ralf Uwaxurike. He said “Biafra has come of age and in line with internal law after 20 years, a state asking for self rule can have its demands granted, explaining. “We have since 1999 been asking for self determination and it is now twenty one years and what we have done is the way to go because we are recognised by international law.” But the Cross River State Security Adviser (South) to Governor Ben Ayade, Mr Ani Esin in a reaction late yesterday, warned that such action by the group could undermine the sovereignty of the country and this will not be tolerated. He said, “any person seeking to destabilize the country through such declaration would be regarded as committing treason. “No other civil authority and government, group seeking to disrupt the peace of the State, or any other organ of government outside the recognised ones in the state would be tolerated and anyone that breaches this will be handed over to security agent for prosecution” . Leaders of Parliament as inaugurated by Effiong are; Oruk Anam, Inyanette Akpan; Ikot Ekpene, Francis Johnson; Eket Nsikak Akpan and Uyo is Emmanuel Okorie. The Calabar leader is Prince Abun Ekpe while Akpabuyo is David Harris. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
