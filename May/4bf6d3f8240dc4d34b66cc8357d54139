George, a 46-year-old black man from Minneapolis, died while being arrested by four cops, with one kneeling on the back of his neck while pinning him to the ground in a report by Huffington Post. He had been stopped for allegedly using a counterfeit $20 bill at a nearby store but was unarmed and handcuffed when horrific footage showed him gasping for air, telling officers “I can’t breathe” and then becoming unresponsive. No arrests have yet been made, but George’s death sparked riots in Minneapolis last night. All four officers in the footage have been sacked from the force and the FBI has opened an investigation into their conduct. Star Wars actor John called for justice over George’s death in an Instagram Live stream filmed on Wednesday night. On camera, he said: It’s not about career, it’s not about money. A lot of people like to bring that up, all those things are just a part of my dream, just a part of working, that’s got nothing to do with how you treat people. It’s a madness. So when I say it, I mean it. You lot can’t rattle me. I’m not a guy to be rattled. I wasn’t raised by no weak people, you understand? So first of all, you’re going to respect black people online and make sure if you’re commenting on all my pictures or videos, and you’re saying anything about no black people, you’re saying any racist s**t, that’s straight-up blocked. John then shared a picture of George on Instagram but turned off the comments section to ensure he got his message across. He also spoke against racism on his twitter page and telling anyone who supports racism to unfollow.
