Founder of Daar Communications, Chief Raymond Dokpesi, and two of his grandchildren have tested negative to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) twice and consequently discharged from the University of Abuja Treatment Centre. However, Raymond Jr and some other members of his family are still receiving treatment. In a letter of appreciation signed by the media, the 69-year-old media entrepreneur expressed gratitude to God for seeing his family through the trying period. “I am exceptionally indebted to God Almighty for keeping and protecting me and my entire family all through our isolation at the University of Abuja Teaching Hospital, Gwagwalada, isolation centre,” he stated. Dokpesi noted that his two-week ordeal at the hospital provided him with first-hand experience of the enormous challenges before the country. His words, “We are better acquainted with the personal sacrifices many Nigerians are making to ensure that we collectively defeat this pandemic. “This cuts across the policymakers, the care providers, and even the cleaners whose job puts them at constant risk of exposure.” He thanked Nigerians, especially the eminent personalities who reached out to him with messages of support. On May 1, Dokpesi, his daughter-in-law and six members of his family tested positive for the virus, days after his first son, Raymond Jnr, tested positive for the virus.
