Two persons were yesterday feared dead at Moniya area of Ibadan, Akinyele Local Government of the state, as a fuel-laden tanker went up in flames leaving several shops and vehicles completely razed by fire. Traders, commuters and residents of the area were seen scampering for safety as the inferno continued unabated with high intensity. The extent of the damage could not yet be determined at the time of filing this report as firemen and sympathisers were still battling the fire late into the night. The extent of the fatality could also not be ascertained as a result of the confusion. Many eyewitnesses told journalists that the inferno started when the tanker skidded off the road. One eyewitness, Tunde Adedayo, said the State Fire Service arrived at the scene about 35 minutes after the fire started. “There was a loud blast which was followed immediately by a huge ball of fire with a thick cloud of smoke. It consumed everything in its way as people started running up and down. There was confusion everywhere and people were crying for help. No one could move near the fire, everybody was scrambling for safety”. Chief Fire Officer, Oyo State Fire Service, Adewuyi Moshood, said his men arrived at the scene in good time considering the distance they needed to cover to get to the spot. “The fire started when a fully laden tanker conveying diesel lost control while descending the slope beside a filling station at Moniya. There was brake failure and the vehicle crushed a vehicle going to Ogbomoso. One passenger, who was trapped in the vehicle got burnt. Another life was lost soon after but we are yet to determine the total number of casualties.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
