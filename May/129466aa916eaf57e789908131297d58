The Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB), has unveiled BrentPlus, a series of initiatives that will stimulate innovations in the oil and gas industry and ancillary sectors, and create a platform for local creation of digital technologies.
   
The Executive Secretary of NCDMB, Simbi Wabote, unveiled BrentPlus during a webinar, titled: “Innovating for the future of Nigeria’s oil and gas industry and its linkage sectors.” 
   
He explained that one of the strategic initiatives under the Nigerian Content 10-year roadmap is to promote the development of innovative in-country solutions in the oil and gas industry.  Subsequently, NCDMB will pick out the biggest challenges and call for innovations from interested teams with ideas, prototypes, solutions and relevant experiences, after which the applications will be reviewed by judges and shortlisted, with a few selected.
   
He said the third stage of the BrentPlus will be a Hackathon – a three-day residential camp where “participating teams will meet with industry stakeholders and further understand the challenges. Teams will revalidate their solutions and pitch at the end of boot camp. Five winning teams will be selected.”
   
Wabote explained further that Hackathon enables crowd-sourcing of digital innovations that will solve challenges. The idea is to provide a platform for individuals to get together for a short period of time to collaborate on a project.  He added: “The team/company must be a registered, or intending to register as a profit/business entity. The solution described in response to the challenge must be driven by digital technology- Software, Hardware or both.
