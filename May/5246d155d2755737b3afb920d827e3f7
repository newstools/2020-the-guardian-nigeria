Jada has revealed that being quarantined with Will has made her realize she doesn’t know her husband at all. The actress made this known on her “Red Table Talk” show telling her daughter, Willow, and mother, Adrienne Banfield Norris, that life got so busy, she doesn’t know the true guy underneath his big personality. Jada told her guest, Pastor John Gray: “I gotta be honest. I think one of the things that I’ve realized is that I don’t know Will at all, I feel like there’s a layer that you get to, life gets busy and you create these stories in your head, and then you hold onto these stories and that is your idea of your partner; that’s not who your partner is.”
