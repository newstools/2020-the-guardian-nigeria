Again, Kaduna State Government has extended the lockdown in the state by two weeks to prevent the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).The deputy governor, Dr. Hadiza Balarabe, said during a live broadcast on Tuesday night that after 60 days, the state government reviewed the quarantine orders and approved the recommendation to extend the partial lockdown for two weeks, with adjustments to permit the re-opening of certain sectors. Her words, “The extension was intended to preserve the state’s ability to protect and empower citizens, lead the fight against COVID-19 and make necessary adjustments to the partial lockdown, to permit the safe resumption of the pursuit of livelihoods in more sectors. “Schools, places of worship and markets will remain closed under the adjusted orders, while relevant government officials and agencies will be engaging with religious leaders, transport unions, traditional institutions, market unions, school proprietors and other stakeholders, as may be identified from time to time, to discuss the conditions and circumstances for a safe reopening of the sectors. “We do not take for granted the support of our citizens and the gravity of the sacrifices you all have made. It is true that there are still active COVID-19 cases in our state and we acknowledge that without your sacrifices, the number of persons infected could have been higher.” To keep everyone safe, according to the deputy governor, government and citizens must continue to work together. She remarked: “COVID-19 has not gone away. It remains a very infectious and disruptive disease. Therefore, to avoid its perils and protect lives, citizens must henceforth take the lead as individuals responsible to themselves, their families and their societies. Personal responsibility is the weapon that every citizen must wield to ensure proactive protection for themselves and others from infection by COVID-19.
  
“When the decision was taken on Saturday, April 25, 2020 to extend the initial lockdown by 30 days, the government also charged a committee of senior officials to begin planning a post-lockdown scenario for the state.” “That committee has since submitted its report on how to safely re-open Kaduna State, and it identified availability of realistic health data as one crucial factor for making any decision. This is an important matter given the COVID-19 infection in our state and in neighbouring states. Many of the cases recorded in Kaduna have either been from persons with history of inter-state travel or their contacts.”From Monday, June 1, 2020, the revised regulations will come into effect, she added.
