Dominated by tears, as we bid some goodbye from the earth, the earth renewed our hopes with the little cries of new babies. Thankfully, it is Children’s day week and we have a reason to take our attention from the virus. Here is a rundown of the week: The Onions Revenge
A woman has brought the saying “I’m not crying, it’s the onions” to life. A Chinese lady, Miss Zhao, followed the road less travelled after she discovered her ex was cheating when she went through his phone. She ended the relationship and wept for three days only to find out that her ex had moved on. An angry Zhao decided to get back at him by delivering 1,000 kilograms of onions with the message “You made me cry for three days, now it’s your turn.” Will this work? We’d see. The “Scarring” Homework
Even more than ever is the need to monitor everything your child is consuming. An English woman, Mrs. Taylor, who assumed that her daughter would be given assignments to keep her busy, got the shock of her life this quarantine season. Some assignments, teachers at Archbishop Sentamu Academy gave her 11-year-old daughter was to define pornography, female genital mutilation, and wet dreams in their Personal, Social and Health Education (PSHE). According to the 34-year-old mum, if her daughter had searched online, the results would have “destroyed her mind” and “scarred her for life”. Shriek! It’s Bolt Season
Hopefully, one who would take over Usain Bolt’s records is here. The Olympics gold medalist and his long-time partner Kasi Bennett have welcomed a child together. Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness announced the news of the couple’s baby girl’s birth. The 33-year-old in previous interviews has said that he isn’t sure whether he would push any future child of his towards athletics, feeling that their father’s legacy could be too tough a cross to bear. Bolt is the only man in history to win gold at three successive Olympics, doing so in 2008, 2012 and 2016. Gloom in “Twilight”
A sad one for the “Twilight” series and Nigerian-American community as “Twilight”’s actor Gregory Tyree Boyce and his Nigerian girlfriend Natalie Adepoju are dead. Boyce, 30- and 27-year-old Adepoju were pronounced dead in a Las Vegas residence. According to the E! News, “Greg’s cousin woke up and noticed that Greg’s car was still at the house. He was worried because Greg was to be in LA. His cousin went to check on him and found them.”
Natalie Adepoju’s family launched a GoFundMe account with a $15,000 goal to send their daughter home. The cause of the couple’s deaths has not been revealed. Healer Turns Healee
A Cameroonian pastor Franklin Ndifor, who laid his hands on dozens of confirmed and suspected coronavirus sufferers has died less than a week after contracting the virus. Dr Gaelle Nnanga, who was called to treat Ndifor after he started suffering severe respiratory difficulties a week after falling ill with the virus, said the pastor died ten minutes after treatment. He said that some members of Ndifor’s church called him to come to the pastor’s aid when they found out he was in agony. Ndifor was also a candidate in the country’s last presidential election.
