Super Eagles’ new Assistant Coach, Joseph Yobo has disclosed that the team’s Head coach, Gernot Rohr would determine his role in the national team.
Speaking on a radio programme yesterday, Yobo revealed he has been in constant touch with Rohr since the federation appointed him as one of the coaches in the team, noting that working with the present crop of players in the team would enable him aid the total development of the side. Yobo said he was coming to the Eagles to contribute the wealth of experience he gathered as a player over the years, adding that working with the Eagles off and on the pitch would bring more unity to the squad. He also posited that working with Rohr would help him to gain experience from the Franco-German coach. “With the level of our discussions, I believe we will have a cordial working relationship. I have not meet the Eagles coach personally, but I believe he is a good coach. “Every national team has five assistants working with the team, but in our case Rohr will determine the role he wants me to play in the team,” he said. Yobo refused to disclose the nature of the contract he has with the NFF, adding, however, that he was ready to contribute his quota to the development of the game. “My desire to get into coaching was based on the accolade I got as a football pundit in the Champions Leagues games on television.“Now, I don’t think I will have any issue with the present Eagles team even though the only player in that team I played with for a long time is Ahmed Musa, while I spent a short time with Kenneth Omeruo. “I only watch the Eagles from far like every other Nigerian, but when I get working with the players closely, I will know how to relate with them to bring more unity to the side,” he said. The ex Fernabahce FC of Turkey defender also disclosed that he was working towards getting his coaching license.“The COVID-19 lockdown has affected my plans, but there are courses that I am running on line. “You will understand that in the aspect of coaching, there are courses you must be there physically to do.” Speaking on the continued shut out of NPFL players from the Super Eagles, Yobo said, “I strongly believe the Nigerian league has talented players that can be in the team. My advice to any domestic player that gets called up to the Super Eagles is not to feel intimidated or timid when among the foreign-based players. “He should get on the pitch and give his best. The Nigerian league has players that can gradually fit into the senior national team.”Yobo disclosed that the best domestic coaches he worked with in his career as a footballer were the late Stephen Keshi and late Amodu Shaibu. Omokaro said it was important for the NFF to take the issue of inviting domestic players to the Super Eagles serious, saying the move would help raise the standard of the Nigerian league. “I am delighted that one of the conditions given to Rohr by the NFF for his contract to be renewed is to go round the country and look for good players for the Super Eagles. “With this condition in the public domain, I don’t think Rohr will give excuses of not inviting domestic players for national assignments. “We have to go back to the way things were done during my era when domestic and foreign-based players were given equal chance to prove their skills in the Super Eagles. “I believe the NFF has realised this, that is why the rules of watching the domestic league has been given to Rohr. The Nigerian league will develop if Rohr paid keen interest in the league’s best players,” Omokaro said.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
