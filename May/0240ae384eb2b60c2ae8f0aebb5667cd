Benue State does not fall within the bracket of states with a high number of persons confirmed positive for the dreaded coronavirus. Although the state has less than 10 cases, it came into national consciousness over the profile of its index case, a recent returnee from the United Kingdom.
 
Ever since she was asked to go into isolation, Mrs. Susan Okpe has remained at the centre of disputations over the credibility of her test results and the methodology of her withdrawal from public contact.
  
Preying on the delicate identity politics in the state, some early commentators tried to create the impression that a Tiv governor, Dr. Samuel Ortom, was haranguing Mrs. Okpe, who is Idoma, to achieve some national sympathy.  “So the Action Committee swiftly went into action, and currently as I speak with you, we have isolated him and also isolated the family,” he said.  “We have taken the samples of the family to Abuja to see if they are negative or positive, but they will be confined in a place for 14 days to see if the symptoms will manifest or not. We are happy with the level of cooperation from our people.

So the committee is doing excellently well despite all the challenges that we have especially when it comes to funding and all that.” Drama continues in Abuja
