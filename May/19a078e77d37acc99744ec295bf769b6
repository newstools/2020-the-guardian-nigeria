Saray Carrillo felt she was being unfairly treated by the judges on the Spanish version of MasterChef, so she decided to cook up a terrifying meal in revenge according to a report from The Mirror. She was one of many amateur chefs looking to impress the panel of seasoned pros, but harsh criticism of her previous efforts had turned the relationships sour. The 27-year-old had also reportedly confided in the judges that she had a fear of handling and cooking birds. So when the competitors were challenged to do exactly that, Saray was taken aback and saw it as a means to water down all her effort. Faced with preparing and cooking a whole partridge, Saray refused and decided instead to take revenge on the judges, and was quickly booted from the programme. Rather than making any attempt to pluck, prepare or cook the bird, she simply whacked it on a plate, feathers, head and all, before garnishing with some sliced tomatoes and spring onion. Bon appétit. Proudly and defiantly walking her dish to the judge’s table, her competitors were left with their heads in their hands as the judges exchanged some angry glances. The trio of experts unsurprisingly declined the opportunity to sample the terrifying meal, and Saray was on the receiving end of some stern words before being sent on her way. With her time on the show being branded a ‘mistake’, Saray shrugged, removed her apron, and said: “bye-bye”.
