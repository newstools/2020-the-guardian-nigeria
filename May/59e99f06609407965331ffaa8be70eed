A Corpse smuggled into Akwa Ibom State from Lagos has been intercepted and buried by the state COVID-19 regulation enforcement team. The deceased was buried in accordance with Coronavirus burial protocol, while the persons who transported the body were quarantined, pending the outcome of their test. The Commissioner for Health, Dr. Dominic Ukpong, disclosed this at a meeting of the State Incident Management Committee, yesterday, while commending security agents for efficiency in discharging their duties. He maintained that the deceased was transported in an ambulance from Lagos, wondering how, despite the inter-state lockdown, the culprits transported the body through seven states, beating security formations in those states. “But for the alertness of the police officers posted to our borders, the corpse would have successfully made it to its destination in Mkpat Enin Local Government Area.” He urged the public to report any one who recently returned to their community to the authorities, while calling on community leaders to give their utmost support to government to keep their communities safe.
