All Progressives Congress’ (APC) former Interim Chairman, Chief Bisi Akande has described former Presidential Liaison Officer, Alhaji Kashim Ibrahim-Imam, as the party’s cornerstone hitherto overlooked in appointments. He said Ibrahim-Imam played a crucial role in the merger of legacy parties culminating in the birth of APC. While congratulating Ibrahim-Imam on his appointment as Chairman, Board of Trustees of Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFund), Akande also thanked President Muhammadu Buhari for doing what he called the right thing. “When Buhari’s government, perhaps inadvertently, gave Ibrahim-Imam no position, Tinubu requested me to talk to Buhari on Ibrahim-Imam’s behalf. I refused because I presumed that there must have been dangerous disconnects between the APC and its government. “Now that the President has approved a position for Ibrahim-Imam in government, I congratulate President Buhari. I congratulate Ibrahim-Imam. I also sincerely congratulate the APC. I hope that from now on, the party and the government can learn to work in sync. Ibrahim-Imam’s appointment shows that the rejected stone has been reserved for the corner of the house,” Akande, also a former governor of Osun State, said.
