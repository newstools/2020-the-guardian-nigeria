Shareholders of Access Bank have said the lender’s aggressive drive towards pulling resources across industries to provide technical and operational support in the fight against of Coronavirus through the CACOVID would ultimately help to combat the spread of the virus in Nigeria. The shareholders, who spoke at the yearly general meeting of the bank, in Lagos, recently, said CACOVID has done a lot in the areas of providing funding and building advocacy through aggressive awareness drives to curtail the spread of the pandemic.
 
Specifically, the Founder, Independent Shareholders Association of Nigeria (ISAN), Sunny Nwosu, commended Access Bank’s efforts in the private-sector-led, Coalition Against COVID-19, to support Federal Government’s fight against the pandemic, including providing and equipping medical facilities in the six geopolitical zones.  Wigwe said the bank is already addressing the issue of high operating expenses, and taking drastic measures to reduce them significantly, adding that “Access Bank was well-prepared for the COVID-19 early enough, and created ways of working from home and working with our customers. We set up links with our customers and many ways of reaching out to our customers three or four times a day. 
 
“This happened even before we started working with the larger society and enabled us to start fighting this pandemic. So Access Bank has put a system in place and now working with CACOVID to make sure that everyone knows what he is doing,” he said.
