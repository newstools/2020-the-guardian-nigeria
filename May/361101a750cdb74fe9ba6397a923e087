Mut4y, who is one half of iconic production duo Legundary Beatz, continues to strengthen his solo run. The multi-talented artist is credited with the production of Wizkid’s magnum opus, Ojuelegba, and a plethora of urban classics. The producer who recently celebrated his contributions to Bad Bunny and J Balvin’s Grammy-nominated Oasis album has now unveiled a new EP with a budding neo-Afropop artiste who goes by the name of Elhi. The collaborative project dubbed Eu4ria houses five tracks that are a mix of mellow, addictive, and joy-evoking. The EP sees the two play to their respective strengths as Elhi effortlessly flaunts his vocal dexterity whilst Mut4y helms the production end of things. Stream the EP below:
