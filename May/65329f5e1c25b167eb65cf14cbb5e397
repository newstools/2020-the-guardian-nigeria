The highly anticipated Rihanna documentary in almost here. A fan account shared the first look at the project, which Amazon Studios picked up for $25million last year.  The very first image for Rihanna: Volume One shows the singer/entrepreneur/fashion designer in the studio with “coming soon” attached to it. There are few details about the Peter Berg-directed project, describing the piece as an ‘inside look at the personal and professional life of Rihanna’ according to a report by The Daily Mail. Berg has been working on the project for a number of years. The director was given an all-access look at the star, compiling over 1200 hours of footage to create the documentary. Also, Berg previously worked with the Anti songstress on the 2012 thriller Battleship. Rihanna has already been involved in several Amazon Prime projects. Earlier this year, she appeared in the straight-to-streaming Donald Glover project Guava Island which was produced by Amazon Studio as reported by The Daily Mail. And her Fenty X Savage lingerie show was streamed exclusively on the platform this past September. Director Peter Berg spoke to The Hollywood Reporter about the project all the way back in 2017, talking about his travels with Rihanna and one of the traumatic moments they experienced together. In his words: That was a fun change of pace. To go travel with Rihanna around Europe, and Rihanna is surrounded by girls. We were in Nice [France]. She was going to do a concert on Bastille Day. And that truck driver who killed all those people plowed through them right in front of our hotel. So even in me trying to do something light, I had a very, very front row seat to something that horrific. People have been anticipating Rihanna’s new album, they might need to enjoy the Documentary instead.
