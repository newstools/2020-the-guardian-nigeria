In a bid to deliver one million home-made face masks to the most vulnerable communities in Nigeria before the end of May and a four-month target of a total of 50 million face masks by the end of August, a group of Nigerian youths, which has 250 young tailors as volunteers, have teamed up to launch a campaign tagged Mask4All. The project manager, Joshua Adeloye, said that the project started with the 250 volunteers delivering 1,000 facemasks weekly long before the Lagos State government made it mandatory for citizens to wear one when going out. “Through this volunteer process, the group will produce and distribute good quality locally-made double-ply facemasks at about 40 per cent of the market price, which presently goes for between N400 and N500 per mask,” he said. Lanre Oyegbola, Strategic Team Lead of the project, said: “We shall crowd-fund the payment for the masks to ensure they keep producing at marginal profit against the market price of N400. We now have young tailors who have volunteered for this project in 20 states and the FCT but our aim is to cover the entire country and make the face masks available for everybody”.
