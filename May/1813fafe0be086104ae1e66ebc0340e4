As Muslim Ummah in the country celebrate this year’s Eid el-Fitr, the Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Mohammed Adamu, says the COVID-19 prevention regulation orders, including the inter-state movement restriction, national curfew and the prohibition of mass socio-religious gatherings by the Federal Government in Lagos, Ogun, Kano States and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), and restriction orders by governments in some States of the Federation, are still in force. The IGP appealed to citizens to observe the Eid celebrations bearing in mind the unusual times occasioned by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, adding that the police will leave no stone unturned in the enforcement of the orders. Force Public Relations Officer, DCP Frank, who disclosed this yesterday in Abuja, said, “The IGP notes that the successful conclusion of the Ramadan, a period of self-denial geared towards attaining wholesomeness, reinforces his belief that with the citizens’ collective perseverance and voluntary compliance with the prevention regulations emplaced by governments at all levels, the nation will overcome the COVID-19 pandemic.” The IGP assured the nation of adequate security during and after the Eid el-Fitr celebrations, noting that proactive and robust anti-crime measures, including the deployments of tactical and intelligence assets of the Force, are already in place to prevent any untoward incidents in the country.
