Ebonyi State Government said it has concluded arrangements to send 6,000 bags of 5kg rice and N15m as palliatives to indigenes of the state in Lagos and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja to cushion the effects of coronavirus. Speaking in Abakaliki, Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Uchenna Orji, said the state governmentâ€™s gesture was to assist its indigenes in Lagos and the FCT, who might have been affected in one way or another by the pandemic. Orji, who is also the Acting Commissioner for Human Capital Development, said those in Lagos would receive 4000 (5kg) bags of rice and N10m while those in Abuja would get 2000 (5kg) bags of rice and N5m. He pleaded with other Ebonyi people living in other states of the federation not to feel that government was only assisting those residents in Lagos and FCT, but rather as progress being made, noting Governor David Umahi loves every Ebonyi indigene irrespective of where they reside. He noted that the state government would soon commence distributing palliatives to those living in the state, urging them to be patient. While assuring the people of their safety, he noted that Governor Umahi had concluded with his Enugu State counterpart, Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi to build gates at Ebonyi/Enugu borders to check influx of people with COVID-19 cases to both states. Besides, Orji said due to the precautionary measures put in place by the state government to curtail the spread of coronavirus, the state has recorded minimal cases of contact tracing.
