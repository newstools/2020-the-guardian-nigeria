Denmark introduces drive-in concert | Image: Ritzau Scanpix-AFP via Getty Images As many businesses and activities shut down across the world in a bid to curb the spread of coronavirus, Denmark has found a way to introduce live concerts without breaking the social distance regulations. In the city of Aarhus, Denmark, hundreds of people attended a sold-out live concert with performance from Danish singer-songwriter Mads Langer. The drive-thru event was held at a newly constructed venue just outside the city. With police and health officials giving the concert a nod of approval, the event sold 500 tickets in just minutes and went off without a hitch.

The attendees also had the chance to get up close with the singer through Zoom video conferencing. “I’ve played many concerts in my life, but this is really a first,” Langer said, through an audio feed broadcast over very limited FM radio frequency into fans’ cars. According to local newspaper Jyllands-Posten, a police officer confirmed that the event went smoothly : “There are only positive messages from our people on the spot. It has been controlled. People have behaved the way they should, and all the cars were out of place within half an hour” The concert was the first in a series of performances at the space on the outskirts of the city, with the stage also doubling as a drive-in film theatre on other nights.
