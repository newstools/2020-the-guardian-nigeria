Kano state government has reaffirmed that Christians are free to attend Churches on Sundays while the state remains under Federal Government lockdown. Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje made the clarification on Tuesday at a meeting held with the leadership of Christian Community in Kano held at government house. Ganduje told the leaders of the Church that government had considered three days of the week including Fridays and Sundays to enable Muslims and Christians faithful worship in congregation. The governor, who emphasised on economic and social challenges induced by the lockdown, explained that the decision to relax the presidential order to four hours every Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays became pertinent to ease the pressure, especially on common citizens. The Governor, however, reminded the Churches of strict compliance to protocols and guidelines stipulated by the ministry of heath to further curtail the spread of COVID-19. He said Government has directed fumigation of 31 Churches and provided material needs to keep the places of worship safe. The Chairman, Christian Association of Nigeria, Kano Chapter, Adeyemi Adeyemo applauded the reopening of the worship centres and pledged that churches will support the government policies and programs to keep Kano safe of the deadly virus.
