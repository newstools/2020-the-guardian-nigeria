The Gazzetta Dello Sport reports that the Swede hurt his calf in training but various outlets claim that the injury may also involve his Achilles tendon, which would rule him out for weeks, with Serie A potentially restarting next month.

The player will undergo a scan in 10 days time.” Milan did not say for how long the 38-year-old would be out of action, although Italian media reports say he could be facing four weeks on the sidelines, as Serie A eyes a potential restart next month. Ibrahimovic rejoined the seven-time European champions during this season’s winter transfer window. He suffered a calf injury shortly after signing in January. He returned to Italy two weeks ago from Sweden, where he had been training with Hammarby, in order to prepare for a possible return to action.
