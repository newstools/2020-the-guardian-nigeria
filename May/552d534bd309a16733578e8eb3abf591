With the disruptions in the global oil industry, causing energy imbalance and low demand for oil, one of the operators in the power value-chain, has urged the government to implement regulations that would aid gas utilisation for power and home use in order to aid economic growth.
     
In a chat with The Guardian on, “The future of oil and Nigeria’s energy dynamics,” the Chief Executive Officer, Century Power Generation Ltd., Dr. Chukwueloka Umeh, said there is no better time than now for the Federal Government to take definitive and courageous steps towards diversifying the economy.
   
Umeh said: “In the face of the cyclic oil prices, we must now see a Nigeria without oil and immediately start diversifying to agriculture and manufacturing. In order to do this successfully, the gas and power industries need to be unshackled and supported to encourage substantial private investments and growth’’.  One of such projects is the Century Power Okija IPP, which is projected to generate about 1500 megawatts of power when its three phases are completed.
