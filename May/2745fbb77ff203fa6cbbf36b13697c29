Yobe legislator discharged from hospital Forty doctors and other health workers of Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital (AKTH), Kano State, have been given clean bill of health and released from solation.They had tested positive for the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) about three weeks ago while rendering care to patients and were taken to Kwnar Dawakin centre. The ugly development had compelled the hospital to shut down all specialty clinics and consultation, leaving open skeletal services at emergency units.
Chief Medical Director (CMD) of AKTH, Professor Abdurrahman Sheshe, disclosed the discharge of his staff members while receiving hospital consumables and food items from a leading pharmaceutical company yesterday, adding that activities in the teaching hospital were gradually returning to normal. Sheshe said the remaining staff members, who were yet to meet the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) protocol for discharge, were not presenting any critical challenge. “It is really a thing of joy to share with you that the review on the test of those workers who were infected by COVID-19 some weeks ago and put on isolation was just forwarded to me, and 40 of them tested negative. No death recorded and no condition attached to the discharge. “The remaining 10, who are still on Isolation, are doing very well and will probably be discharged before Eid el-Fitr, as disclosed by their care-givers,” he said. Representative of the donor, Sunday Okoh, said the donation was part their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in the fight against COVID-19, with the belief that together the country would be able to conquer the pandemic. Items donated include eight boxes of face masks, 20 tins of vitamin C by 1000, 200 hand sanitisers, 200 tablets of herbal soap, two bags of rice and two bags of cassava flour among others consumables. Similarly, Yobe State House of Assembly member, Lawan Inuwa, has been discharged from the state’ds specialists’ hospital in Damaturu. Inuwa, who represents Nguru Central Constituency, was discharged yesterday after testing negative for COVID-19. “I was discharged today from this hospital after several tests of the virus on me turned negative,” he said.Hospital sources also told The Guardian in Damaturu, “The lawmaker has left the Damaturu isolation centre to be reunited with his family members.” Yobe, since May 15, 2020 recorded 12 cases of COVID-19 and there was no new case in the state for past six days.
