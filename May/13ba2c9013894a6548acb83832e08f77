Niger Delta Youths have called on President Muhammadu Buhari and the Coordinator of the Presidential Amnesty Programme (PAP) to urgently address all the issues threatening the implementation of the programme and peace in the oil rich region. In a statement signed by its leader, Austine Imahudor, the group asserted current political power play to strangulate the PAP through meagre allocations. It noted that the programme was introduced to develop and empower Niger Delta youths. “This was the obligation the Federal Government undertook in exchange for peace and to end the self-help or (criminal activities) which was the order of the time in the region. “It was in the wisdom of the late President Umaru Yar’Adua to end the incessant destruction of petroleum pipelines and kidnapping that ravaged economic activities in the region by asking the militants and other restive groups to wilfully give up arms in exchange for training and empowerment. This objective has been achieved till now,” Imahudor stated. He drew the attention of the National Security Adviser (NSA) to corrupt individuals that deliberately midwife the death or control of the PAP for their personal gains. The group added: “The presidency should not stand by and watch the cordial relationship between this government and the Niger Delta youth to further deplete, as what is left is a fragile conscience of the Niger Delta youth to hold the existing peace in the region. Nigeria must not allow this conscience, the very last straw, die. “We therefore call on the office of the NSA to urgently revive the PAP by appointing a new indigenous coordinator for the programme, as the current verification cannot and should not be forever. We further urge that all contractors and trainers be paid forthwith to maintain the sanity of contract.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
