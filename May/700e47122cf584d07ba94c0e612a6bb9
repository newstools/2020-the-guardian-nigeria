The Cross River Independent Electoral Commission (CROSIEC) is to deploy 8,000 ad hoc staff for the council election holding this weekend in the state.Its chairman, Dr. Mike Ushie, made the disclosure yesterday while briefing newsmen on his agency’s preparedness for the exercise. “8,000 ad hoc staff will man the 2,266 polling units in the 18 local government areas of the state, with three deployed to each of the polling units,” he said.
Ushie explained that besides sensitive materials, other electoral materials had been distributed to the council areas. Reacting to complaints from some parties over the short notice, the CROSIEC chairman stated:  “The electoral law allows for a seven-day”, adding that the opposition was unnecessary. He said the polls, which were earlier scheduled for March 28, 2020, had to be due to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus.“We are in full compliance with the Independent National Electoral Commission’s (INEC) directives as well that of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) on precautionary measures against COVID-19 by providing hand sanitisers, water and soap for washing of hands and face masks. We will also maintain social distancing,” the chair stated. He explained that only five political parties were participating in the forthcoming election, including the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), All Progressives Congress (APC), and the Young Progressive Party (YPP).
