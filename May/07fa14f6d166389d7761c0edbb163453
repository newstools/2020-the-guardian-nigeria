Former Nigerian international, Bright Omokaro has charged the NFF to insist that Rohr goes round the country to watch NPFL games and pick the best players for invitation to the Super Eagles, if he must remain the team’s manager. Omokaro said it was important for the NFF to take the issue of inviting domestic players to the Super Eagles serious, saying the move would help raise the standard of the Nigerian league. “I am delighted that one of the conditions given to Rohr by the NFF for his contract to be renewed is to go round the country and look for good players for the Super Eagles. “With this condition in the public domain, I don’t think Rohr will give excuses of not inviting domestic players for national assignments. “We have to go back to the way things were done during my era when domestic and foreign-based players were given equal chance to prove their skills in the Super Eagles. “I believe the NFF has realised this, that is why the rules of watching the domestic league has been given to Rohr. The Nigerian league will develop if Rohr paid keen interest in the league’s best players,” Omokaro said. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
