A traditional ruler in Osun State, Oba Adejoro Otebolaku, the Owalare of Ilare, has said the monarch and his son accused of raping a 14-year-old girl (name withheld) recently would not go unpunished if found culpable. While denying any involvement in the sex scandal, Otebolaku, a prominent member of Ijesa North Traditional Council, said a monarch under his territory in Obokun Local Government Area of the state, Oba David Ogungbemi, the Aketewi of Iketewi, was the personality involved in the rape saga. The Owalare in a statement he personally signed and made available to our correspondent in Osogbo charged journalists to conduct proper investigations on the sex scandal. He assured the general public “that appropriate sanctions would be meted on the monarch involved if he is found culpable of the heinous act.” Owalare clarified that the media reports during the week that a traditional ruler in Ilare land was apprehended by the police over rape and impregnation of a 14-year old girl in the town was not him but Oba Ogungbemi. It would be recalled that Oba Ogungbemi and his son, Idowu, were arrested by the Osun police command for the alleged rape. It was gathered that the victim was living with one Esther Ogungbemi, who was her father’s sister in Ilare, Obokun Local Government Area of the state. The duo of father and his son were alleged to have defiled the girl and had intercourse with her by force. It was after the girl became pregnant that her guardian reported to the police. Meanwhile, the state police command through its Public Relations Officer, Mrs. Yemisi Opalola, has stated that the said monarch and his son were still in the Crime Investigations Unit of the command for investigation.
