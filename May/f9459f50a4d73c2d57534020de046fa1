Accident claims 15 lives in Ogun during lockdown, FRSC says A petrol tanker has exploded with one person severely burnt in Calabar, Cross River State. The sad incident occurred yesterday at Lemna road close to the North West filling station when a welder that was burnt by the fire was doing a minor repair on the tanker. A source, who witnessed the accident, simply known as Bassey, said the tank exploded when the welder was working on the truck. He said: “The tanker exploded when the welder was welding it and he was the only there at the time of the accident.“He sustained several burns and was rushed to the hospital. I pray he survives it because the degree of the burns I saw was severe, I just hope,” he said. Meanwhile, the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) says 15 persons died while 27 others sustained injuries from road accidents in Ogun State since the federal and state governments restricted movement in the state 45 days ago. Mr. Clement Oladele, FRSC Sector Commander in Ogun, disclosed this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abeokuta yesterday. Oladele said that during the period, a total of 49 road traffic crashes occurred while 776 vehicles were penalized for various offences. He said 110 vehicles out of the 776 offenders were sanctioned for overloading. He warned desperate drivers and travelers willing to enter the state in spite of the lockdown to desist from such act. Oladele reminded residents that exemptions were those conveying petroleum products, vehicles transporting agricultural goods and those on essential services, including medical personnel and the media. “Easy passage is accorded vehicle drivers covered by the waivers, while those in breach are either politely turned back or apprehended and booked for the offences they contravened,” he said.
