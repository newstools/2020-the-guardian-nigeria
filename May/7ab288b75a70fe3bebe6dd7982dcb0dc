There is this legendary debate in the 100 level undergraduate philosophy class on the primacy of Egg and Chicken. The germane issue was the demand through academic research and rigorous mental exercise to uncover which of the two comes first between Chicken and Egg originally. Whereas some of us think that since Chickens are hatched from eggs, it makes a lot of sense to conclude hastily that the egg comes before chicken. This conclusion became entangled in a cacophony of further and better inquiry as to how the egg itself could have emerged without the Chicken since it is universally known that for the Chicken to emerge firm the egg there has to be a process of fertilization which inevitably lead to the production of eggs from whence the chickens are hatched. But then, the end of this discussion snowballed into fresh debates regarding how the could have emerged without the egg. So the debate went round and round until we got tired. I seriously can’t place my hand on how we ended that intellectual exercise. This elementary debate can be related to the long-standing relationship between the Federal governments and the Universities in Nigeria on the thorny issues of operational and funding autonomy vis-a-vis the all-important duty of the Federal Government to build a system of governance that eradicate all traces of corruption and abuse of power as Constitutionally mandated in Section 15(5) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria of 1999 as amended which says that “The State is OBLIGED to eradicate corrupt practices and abuse of Office”. However, there has been a longstanding debate between the Universities through their Union known as the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) on one hand and the Federal Government of Nigeria represented by the Federal Ministries of Education, Labour and Productivity and the Office of the Accountant General of the Federation. An item of debate is on the economic reform programme of the Government which started as far back as the then President Olusegun Obasanjo era under whose administration the then Federal Minister of Finance Professor Mrs Ngozi Okonjo Iweala who is a theocrat produced by the World Bank began the WORLD Bank assisted Economic Reforms that were aimed at fast-tracking the process of institutionalizing accountability and transparency in the administration of public finances. These holistic giant strides done by the World bank in the area of financial reforms in Nigeria were spearheaded through a body known as the Bureau of Public Service Reforms based in the nation’s political capital.  Set up on 4th February 2004 as an independent and self-accounting body. The mission is to facilitate the reform of Nigeria’s public service, driven by national interest and efficient management of Resources and talents. The mandate is to initiate, coordinate and ensure full implementation of government reform policies and programmes. Specifically, BPSR coordinates all World Bank Projects in all sectors of our Economy. To start with, the whole idea of Reform is global and started properly in Nigeria in 1999 at the inception of Democratic government, before then, there was a clear mistrust by the international community to come to Nigeria to invest. World bank then started the idea of reform and it is beyond Treasury reform then. Another point worth noting is that prior to now, we had the Federal Tenders Board, which was humongous and inefficient. New guidelines on Public Procurement abolished the Federal Tender’s Board. There is no gainsaying the fact that the Presidential initiative on continuous Auditing (PICA) is involved with Personnel Cost while Efficiency Unit is to handle the running cost of Ministries. These ground-breaking reforms are categorized into diverse segments such as IPPIS, GIFMIS, TSA, among others. GIFMIS stands for Government Integrated Financial Management Information System, and their code is known as GIFMIS Revenue Reference Number (GRR or GRRN). It is a ten-digit code that helps the Government to identify, classify, interpret and account for all revenues it receives. Then another strategic component of the financial reform measures put in place in Nigeria with the guidance of the World Bank is the Integrated Payroll and Personnel INFORMATION System (IPPIS) which technically is an information communications technology (ICT) project initiated by the Federal Government of Nigeria to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of payroll administration for its ministries, Departments and agencies(MDAs). And then we have the TSA which is the Treasury Single Account that is a financial system or policy in use in several countries all over the World. There are no empirical doubts that the ERGP (Economic Reforms and Governance Project) is a World Bank Project and GIFMIS is part of the subproject under BPSR reforms. The above is the summary of the policies that successive administrations have canvassed and implemented aimed at eradicating corruption associated with the administration of Public finance. The current administration in line with tradition and precedence identified all of these reform policies as tangential to the achievements of the overall goal of purifying the central administration of resources so as to maximise the benefits for the public good. The decision to continue with these economic measures have been met with stiff resistance from some quarters.  However, our area of focus is the discord between the Federal Government of Nigeria and the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) on the desirability or otherwise of the IPPIS in the payments of salaries of University teachers. The Central argument of the lecturers is that since the academia is autonomous therefore it is unlawful for the central government to now include the Universities in the larger implementation of the newly introduced payment system which as the underlying on me five says is to ensure transparency and accountability in the disbursements of public funds to institutions of the central government. The Universities are centrally accredited by the Nigerian Universities Commission (NUC). The federal government-owned the Federal Universities and indeed the President is the official visit to these universities. The fund used to pay the salaries and wages of the University workers under the auspices of the central government is drawn from the public fund.  The argument against the implementation of the Integrated Payroll and Personnel INFORMATION System (IPPIS) is therefore disconcerting and pedestrian.  The Academic Staff Union of Universities can not be seen arguing about irrelevancy when the issue being debated is supported by the Nigerian constitution as aforementioned. Indeed the law based fight against corruption and abuse of office is a central thematic rationale for the existence of constitutional democracy as it were. Besides, the Federal Universities are centrally owned by the Nigerian Government and appointments into the Governing Councils are centrally coordinated and the approving authority is the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria who has included these fundamental and far-reaching economic reforms and mainstreamed their observance into his governance blueprints. From the research, I found out that the IPPIS Secretariat is a Department under the Office of the Accountant-General of the Federation responsible for payment of salaries and wages directly to Government employee’s bank account with appropriate deductions and remittances of 3rd party payments such as; Federal Inland Revenue Service, State Boards of Internal Revenue, National Health Insurance Scheme, National Housing Fund, Pension Fund Administrator, Cooperative Societies, Trade Unions Dues, Association Dues and Bank Loans. This is their mandate in their own words: “We are committed to efficient and effective service delivery. Our main aim is to pay accurately and on time within statutory and contractual regulations. We aim to provide a payroll service that is customer-focused and that utilises technology wherever possible. There are 459 MDAS on IPPIS Platform as of 31st June 2017. The department is responsible for processing and payment of salary to over Three hundred thousand (300,000) Federal Government Employees across the 459 MDAs. IPPIS aim is to enrol into the platform, all Federal Government MDAs that draws personnel cost fund from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Since the inception of the IPPIS project in April 2007, the department has saved the Federal Government of Nigeria billions of Naira by eliminating thousands of ghost workers.” IPPIS Department is responsible for:
• Management of FGN   employees records
• Payment of Salary and Wages   to FGN employees
• Deductions of taxes and other   third party payments
• Remittance of payroll   deductions to third party
• Enrolment of employees into   IPPIS database To be continued tomorrow Onwubiko is head, Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
