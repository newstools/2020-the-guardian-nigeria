Former Kano State commissioner for works Magaji Mua’zu has tested positive to coronavirus. Mua’zu confirmed his status on his social media page on Thursday where he announced his relocation to one of the dedicated state isolation facilities. According to him, “this morning my NCDC test is out… I have been confirmed COVID-19 positive… And I have been moved to one of the state facilities. Pray for us.” “Going through a historical moment of our time… A time we will either live to remember or we will be remembered having lived in! Whichever applies Alhamdulillah!.” Mua’zu was relieved of his political appointment for celebrating the death of late Abba Kiyari, chief of staff to the president on his social media page. He became famous for his alleged hatred of late Abba Kiyari, with his popular “win-win” quote, depicting the demise of the former chief of staff to President Muhammadu Buhari as a blessing to Nigeria’s political space. The former chief of staff died of COVID-19 pandemic complications in Lagos two weeks ago. Although, Mua’zu had since sought forgiveness for his action and claimed he was quoted out of context. The former commissioner and long time associate of Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso have since then sought prayers for the late chief of staff.
