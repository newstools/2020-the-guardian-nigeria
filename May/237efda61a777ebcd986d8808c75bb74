DJ Khaled needed to remind a fan he is not single but with a family when she came on his live show to twerk despite the many warnings the American DJ gave. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-1152582 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/27971748-8283535-image-a-26_1588574520040-366x598.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="2094" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/27971748-8283535-image-a-26_1588574520040-366x598.jpg 366w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/27971748-8283535-image-a-26_1588574520040-341x557.jpg 341w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/27971748-8283535-image-a-26_1588574520040-147x240.jpg 147w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/27971748-8283535-image-a-26_1588574520040-293x480.jpg 293w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/27971748-8283535-image-a-26_1588574520040-367x600.jpg 367w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/27971748-8283535-image-a-26_1588574520040.jpg 634w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> He went on Instagram live over the weekend like several of his contemporaries have been doing lately, especially Torey Lanez, DJ Khaled invited some folks in the comments to hop on and join his session for a one-on-one chat. After accepting one woman’s request to chat, he almost immediately regretted it because the lady was half-naked, and prepared to twerk for Khaled on camera. When this happened, he desperately tried to tell her to stop, that he has a family and that he loves his fans, but to please stop because she was clearly embarrassing him. That didn’t deter the determined dancer because she kept at it, and even started pouring water on herself. Khaled had had enough, he ended the chat. After the end of the live chat, he wrote: I have love for everyone please take it easy when I’m on fan luv ig luv. Again I have love for everyone please let’s be respectful nothing but love BLESS UP!” Since the lockdown started, so many ladies have gone on different live sessions to twerk in order to win some money, this might be the reason the lady joined the Live to twerk. The artist and his wife Nicole Tuck, 44, welcomed their first son Asahd, three, in October 2016, when he infamously live-streamed the birth on Snapchat. More recently, the couple welcomed another son, Aalam, three months.
