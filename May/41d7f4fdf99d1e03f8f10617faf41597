Men of the Social Orientation and Safety Corps Agency (So-Safe Corps), a security arm of Ogun State government, have arrested four suspected ritualists caught with a fresh pair of human arms at the Idiroko border area of the state. The suspects are Dosu Mathew, aged 32, a Republic of Benin national; John Feyisetan, aged 47; Samuel Adegbola; and Itomu Micheal, a 40-year-old farmer and herbalist. 
 
The Guardian learnt that the culprits were arrested on Sunday, May 17, by the men of the agency assigned to secure lives and properties of residents at the border area, in line with the Presidential and Ogun State government lockdown directives.
 
According to the corp’s Director of Information and Public Relations, ACC Moruf Yusuf, during the preliminary investigation by the corps, the suspects confessed without torture that three principal suspected ritualists who came all the way from Abeokuta took to their heels knowing the rest culprits have been captured.
