• Call for increased investments in cybersecurity measures
Experts in Nigeria’s financial sector have envisaged further adoption of digital channels for monetary transactions as the new normal post-COVID-19, stressing the need for the sector to embrace and maximise the opportunity.
 
According to them, traditional financial institutions to a larger extent, should adopt the use of digital channels to serve their stakeholders better post-COVID-19, and design sustainable business models to enable them to manage disruptions, and make positive environmental, and social impacts.
 
Specifically, the President, Customer Awareness and Financial Enlightenment Initiative (CAFEi), ‘Debola Osibogun, said the surge of customers in banking halls immediately after the relaxation of the lockdown showed the low level of adoption of digital financial services by Nigerians.  He identified the need for banks to increase investments in cybersecurity measures to cushion the rising rate of cyber threats, as more organisations and customers are adopted digital platforms for service delivery and transactions.
