* COVID-19 Forces Postponement Of Prayers For Gambari Kwara State Governor, AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq has commiserated with the entire Ilorin Emirate and the immediate family of Dr. Amuda Aluko, the Tafida of Ilorin, who died early Friday. A statement by the chief press secretary, Rafiu Ajakaye, stated that Governor AbdulRazaq expressed sadness that the Emirate had again lost one of its illustrious sons whose footprints would remain in the sand of time. Meanwhile, Ilorin town, which is renowned for holding Islamic prayers for prominent natives given political appointments, may have postponed that which would have been held for Professor Ibrahim Agboola Gambari, the new Chief of Staff to President Muhammadu Buhari, due to the pandemic COVID-19. The prayer, codenamed, ‘Dua Shukuru,’ is usually organised for such new appointees by the Emir of Ilorin, some four weeks after the resumption in office of the appointees. Governor AbdulRazaq recalled that Dr Aluko, proprietor of the popular Garin Alimi Hospital Ilorin, contributed immensely to the development of Ilorin and Kwara State, adding that he would be sorely missed. “Dr Aluko was a statesman. He established the largest private hospital in the old Kwara State, which is a 100-bed facility, as a practical demonstration of his patriotism and philanthropy. He was among the first generation of medical doctors in the old Kwara State — indeed among the first three. The Tafida, among other marks of his greatness, was a recipient of a national award (OFR). He was a leading Otoge champion and patron who would look back with pride at the birth of a new Kwara he worked so hard with others to realise,” the statement said. Mallam Abdul Azeez Arowona, spokeman of the Emir of Ilorin, disclosed that prayers in honour of Gambari would be organised when the ban on religious activities is lifted.
