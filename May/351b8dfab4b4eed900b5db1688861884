Brownhill Foundation has donated money and food items to communities in Ogunu, Warri, Delta State, amid the lockdown due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic to ensure the residents comply with the stay-at-home order by the Federal Government. The foundation, a brainchild of the President of the Nigeria Football Federation, Amaju Pinnick, offered food items that include rice, noodles, spaghetti, garri and food spices to 500 families in the communities. According to the Chairman, Board of Trustees of Brownhill Foundation, Andrew Bekederemo, it also gave out cash between N10, 000 and N15, 000. “Everyone has been home without working, so the foundation, through the support of Mr. Pinnick, decided to assist the communities this period in his own little way. “Reaching out to the less-privilege at this time is our priority because COVID-19 has brought so much stress and tribulation to the country and its citizens,” he said. The Head of Ogunu community, Chief Newton Ayiwe, commended the foundation for its gesture, ascribing the succour to “a service to humanity.” Communities that enjoyed the largess include Upper Erejiuwa, GRA suburbs, Ijaw Street, Ajamimogha, Makro, Obahor, amongst others.
