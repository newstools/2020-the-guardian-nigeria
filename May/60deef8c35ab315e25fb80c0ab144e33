Usain Bolt and Kasi Bennett Olympics gold medalist Usain Bolt is the latest celebrity father in time as he and his long time partner Kasi Bennett have welcomed a child together. The news of the couple’s baby girl’s birth was announced by Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness on Monday. In a congratulatory tweet, Holmes wrote: “Congratulations to our sprint legend Usain Bolt and Kasi Bennett on the arrival of their baby girl.” As at press time, the baby’s name is not yet known. Bolt first announced the pregnancy in an Instagram snap in January, when he posted an image of the 30-year-old Bennett cradling her baby bump. In the caption, he added the words: “‘I just want to say a King or Queen is about to be here.” Earlier in March, Bolt and Bennett hosted a lavish gender reveal party that featured fireworks and a huge celebrity guest list. After the party, Bolt who is a world record holder for both 100m and 200m posted a social media video in which he announced: “I just did the reveal and I’m a girl dad.” Bolt is the only man in history to win gold at three successive Olympics, doing so in 2008, 2012 and 2016. The Jamaican is an 11-time world champion and he retired after the 2017 World Championships in London after he suffered a hamstring injury in what was the final race of his career. The 33-year-old in previous interviews has said that he isn’t sure whether he would push any future child of his towards athletics, feeling that their father’s legacy could be too tough a cross to bear. “That’s going to be hard for my kid,” he said, via the Mail Online. “If they want to do it, I’m fine with it. But initially I’m going to say don’t do it, because I know the pressure that will come along with it.”
