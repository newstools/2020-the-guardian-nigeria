The Federal Government says it is renovating and upgrading existing Kaduna Polytechnic Students’ hostels through Public-Private Partnership (PPP). Mr Chidi Izuwah, the Director-General, Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission (ICRC), made this known in a statement on Friday in Abuja. Izuwah had presented the Full Business Case (FBC), Compliance Certificate, to Mr Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba, Minister of State for Education. He said that the renovation was the first PPP project in the education sector in Nigeria to reach the Full Business Case level. “We hope to see more PPPs in the education sector with the twin objective of raising infrastructure standards and quality while reducing the burden of financing the sector from the treasury,” he said. The director-general commended the Rector of the institution and his team for working assiduously to get the project to its current level. He also appreciated the Ministry of Education for giving its full support toward ensuring the realisation of such a historic project. Nwajiuba, who received the certificate on behalf of the Ministry, said the importance of decent accommodation for the youths could not be over emphasised. “We hope this will mark the beginning of good things in the Nigerian educational sector using the PPP model. “Thank you for showing us that this can be done in the industry,” he said. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that ICRC was established to regulate PPP activities in the country and to address physical infrastructure deficit which hampers economic development.
