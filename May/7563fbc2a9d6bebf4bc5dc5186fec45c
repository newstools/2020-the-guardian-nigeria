The World Igbo Congress (WIC) has raised alarm over what it termed mass influx of strangers into the region, saying the development portends clear and present danger, if not checked. The body’s Public Relations officer, Basil Onwukwe, who disclosed this in a statement, called on Ndigbo across the globe to an emergence security meeting on Saturday, May 30, 2020, to harmonise and strengthen efforts of the security agents to safeguard “our homeland.” He said: “We cannot look elsewhere, while our women and our farmlands are taken over by foreigners without identifications. Our leaders have a penchant for self-aggrandisement, and our adversaries have mastered how to take advantage of this very weakness in our leadership. It is time we jettisoned our old ways, for we cannot keep doing the same thing and expecting a different result. “Now is the time to keep the pressure, not only on Fulani political oligarchy but also on our local leaders who have to remain quiet while our land is invaded. Ndigbo must reject all ‘sell-out’ at this stage to save the destiny of our next generation.” Onwukwe said the radical quest for ego and wealth, while the soul of their existence is being threatened needs to stop. “We must identify dedicated concerned Igbo patriots, who are willing to support a genuine effort that will resist adversaries that are working against the survival of our homeland.” He said the ploy for Igbo presidency under the present Nigeria configuration is another self-serving venture, and that when it eventually works, it will not bring equity and fairness in the polity, as their people will continue to suffer in the country’s political imbalance.
