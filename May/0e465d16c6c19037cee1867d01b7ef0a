The spot, which quickly went viral and has been seen more than five million times since its Monday release, mimics the cadence of Reagan’s famous commercial. But while that one projected prosperity and optimism, the anti-Trump ad showed dystopian images of dilapidated homes, abandoned factories and a man applying for unemployment insurance. The video was produced by “The Lincoln Project,” a group of self-described “never-Trump” Republicans including George Conway, husband of counsellor to the president Kellyanne Conway. Trump attacked the group in a four-tweet rant in the early hours of Tuesday. “Their so-called Lincoln Project is a disgrace to Honest Abe,” Trump added, referring to revered Civil War-era President Abraham Lincoln. “I don’t know what Kellyanne did to her deranged loser of a husband, Moonface, but it must have been really bad.” Trump, apparently still incensed, addressed the issue again Tuesday with reporters before departing for an event in Arizona. “I would have them change the name to the ‘Losers Project,'” he said. “They’re Republican losers.” Trump has always used fiery language to push back at opponents, but he has been particularly vocal during the pandemic as critics savage his response. The ad, and the president’s reaction, suggests a fierce war of words lies ahead as Trump and his Democratic opponent Joe Biden begin campaigning ahead of November’s election.
