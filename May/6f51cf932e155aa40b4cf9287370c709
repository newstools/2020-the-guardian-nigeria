Telecommunications operators have expressed their readiness to work with both arms of the National Assembly on the fifth-generation (5G) technology deployment in Nigeria.
 
This follows the Senate’s call on the Federal Government to suspend the planned deployment of the 5G network in the country, pending the resolution of all issues thrown up by the new technology. Operators, under the aegis of Association of Telecoms Companies of Nigeria (ATCON), in Lagos, yesterday, said they will like to work with both the legislators and executive arms of government to address any concerns the Senate has raised regarding 5G.
  
ATCON President, Olusola Teniola, noted that during the extensive COVID-19 lockdown, a number of false claims were made about 5G, and the Senate appears also concerned and wants to verify if there is anything behind them.  IDC said Cloud spending will continue to post moderate growth as businesses continue to fund existing cloud deployments, and some businesses may utilise the remainder of the year to accelerate cloud projects as a means to control costs and defer data centre and application upgrades.
   
“Overall software spending is now expected to decline as businesses delay new projects and application roll-outs, while there is a fundamental link between employment and spending on things like software licenses and campus networks,” Minton said.
