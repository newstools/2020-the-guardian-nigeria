Family members of Michael Mordi of Isho Quarters, Ubulu-Uku in Aniocha South Local Government Area of Delta State have sent a ‘Save Our Soul (SOS) to the Attorney-General of the Federation and governor of Delta State to intervene over an attempt to release a condemned criminal who murdered their son.
 
Ekene Mordi was murdered eight years ago by a cult group led by Tobe Kentoa and the suspect was arrested and tried in a court sitting in Ogwashi-Uku. After the trial, Kentoa was sentenced to death and remanded in Okere correctional centre, Warri.
 
Spokesman of Mordi’s family, Ben Mordi, has raised the alarm that some powerful politicians in his community are planning to release the criminal who has boasted that he would make life unbearable for the family.
 
Mordi said: “A politician has approached us to ask us our opinion on the planned release of Kentoa who murdered our brother in cold blood. He said they want to meet the Commissioner for Justice and Attorney-General of Delta State to use the opportunity of the amnesty programme proposed by the Federal Government to release a condemned criminal.
 
“We were happy that our industrious son’s death was avenged when his killer was sentenced to death, but the family of the convict still want to intimidate us by planning to release him. We were not happy that two of his members were released and they are walking freely today. They are reopening healed wound. They want to prove to us that they are politically connected.
 
“We are passionately appealing to the AGF, Justice Abubakar Malami, Delta State governor, Ifeanyi Okowa and the Delta AG, Mr. Peter Mrakpor, not to release a condemned criminal as his freedom would breed bad blood in the community. It would make other cultists to kill without mercy, as they will have the notion that they can be freed after sometime.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
