There is tension in Taraba State, as a female COVID-19 patient was said to have escaped from an isolation centre in the state. The escapee, whose whereabouts is unknown, has thrown residents into panic for coming in contact with her unknowingly. Some residents in Jalingo, the state capital, who expressed their misgivings to The Guardian, urged the technical committee on COVID-19 to urgently make her identity public. They said there was need for the committee to collaborate with security operatives to fashion out measures that would lead to her immediate arrest. Some residents vowed to remain indoors, even after the lockdown is relaxed, pending when she is arrested and brought back to the centre for proper treatment. The committee, led by the Commissioner for Health, Dr. Innocent Vakkai, gave the escapeeâ€™s name as Talatu Idris, while briefing journalists, yesterday. He said the committee had put in place relevant measures to track her down. He urged members of the public to be vigilant and not envelope themselves in fear, as all legitimate means would be used to get her arrested.
