President of the Senate, Senator Ahmad Lawan, temporarily halted proceedings of the Senate on Tuesday to rebuke Senators who had been breaching the social distancing rule advised by the Nigerian Center for Disease Control (NCDC) to curb the spread of coronavirus. Lawan, who made the observation at the commencement of the session, had to temporarily put the reading and adoption of the votes and Proceedings for the previous sitting on hold. He admonished senators particularly those at the back role to sit far apart from one another in line with the precautionary measures against the spread of coronavirus. “Distinguished colleagues, as leaders and lawmakers, please let us ensure that the principle of Social Distancing is observed. “The principle is not observed at the back seats going by the way distinguished colleagues are seated . “Please let the principle be reflected straight away by ensuring the required gaps between the seats,” Lawan said. Few minutes after the admonition, the Senate president was forced to repeat same again when he told Senator Uche Iyom Ekwunife (PDP Anambra central),  that she was too close to the Deputy Senate president Senator Ovie Omo- Agege of APC Delta Central. Lawan added that all the Senators   should ensure that their face mask is on at all times in the chamber. He stated that any senator who speaks should do so with full usage of face mask .
