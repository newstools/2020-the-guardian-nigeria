Nigeria President Muhammadu Buhari has approved the termination of the appointment of Prof Charles Uwakwe as the registrar and chief executive officer of the National Examinations Council (NECO). “After due consideration of the investigative panel on the allegation of unsatisfactory conduct levelled against you and some management staff of the council, Mr. President in exercise of his powers, has approved your removal as the Registrar and Chief Executive Officer of National Examinations Council with effect from the date of your suspension from duty,” Permanent secretary of the Federal Ministry of Education, Sonny Echono said in a letter on behalf of the Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu. Buhari also dismissed four members of the management of the exam body for various offences including alleged financial impropriety in a separate letter and appointed Abubakar Gana as NECO’s acting registrar. Uwakwe was suspended May 2018 by the Federal Government over alleged financial mismanagement and abuse of office in awarding contracts worth N25 billion without following the due process. The former registrar was accused of violating the Public Procurement Act (2007) and pursuant to PSR 030402 and Part 1 schedule 4 (i) of NECO Establishment Act. NECO in a release on Wednesday confirmed that the suspended registrar had been relieved of his appointment by the President, while four members of the management had also been dismissed. Uwakwe was directed to hand over all the government property in his custody to the acting registrar.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
