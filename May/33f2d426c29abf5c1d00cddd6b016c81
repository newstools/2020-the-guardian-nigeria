Meanwhile, commencing from today, Lagosians are to enjoy free medical consultation and drugs administered to residents across 11 clinics within the metropolis. This is coming courtesy of Stallion Empowerment Initiative (SEI), the charity arm of Stallion Group, in collaboration with Morsun Mobile Clinic. The group’s Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Anant Badjatya, at the weekend said that the joint affiliation would treat over 70 common ailments prevalent in Nigeria and reach out to over 20,000 people in the city within the two months. The service, according to him, aims to provide some succours to people who could not access hospitals due to overcrowding during the pandemic or for those who simply could not afford a treatment, saying that “there is nothing greater than the safety of the people of this country and it is our responsibility to support the government and the community at this time of need.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
