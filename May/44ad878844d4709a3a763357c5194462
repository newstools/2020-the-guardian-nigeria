Oshiomhole pledges fair primary, gov’s aide rejects consensus candidate The Obaseki Mandate Forum (OMF) yesterday purchased the expression of interest and nomination forms for Governor Godwin Obaseki at the All Progressives Congress (APC) national secretariat in Abuja. It, however, faulted insinuations that Governor Obaseki was jittery of direct primary as its Coordinator, Chief Nathaniel Momoh stated that the governor would have been comfortable with either the direct or indirect modes of primaries but for the need to safeguard Edo people. He explained that Obaseki opted for the indirect mode of primary in line with efforts to check the spread of coronavirus in the state, insisting that Obaseki had done well to deserve a second term in office.Also, former Secretary to the Edo State Government (SSG), Osagie Ize-Iyamu, yesterday picked APC governorship nomination form. In a statement issued by John Mayaki Director of Communication and Media for Ize-Iyamu Campaign Organisation, he (Ize-Iyamu) emerged the consensus candidate of APC faction loyal to the party’s National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole and National Leader, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu. Ize-Iyamu, who was the governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2016 election lost to Obaseki. But in a swift reaction, Special Adviser to Obaseki on Media and Communication Strategy, Crusoe Osagie said selecting the party’s gubernatorial candidate was the responsibility of the state’s APC in collaboration with national structure, and as such a consensus candidate to flag the party’s flag in the election could not emerge in Abuja. He said the charade in Abuja was not surprising, as it was hatched and executed by Oshiomhole and his Edo Peoples Movement (EPM), which he described as a dissident group of politicians in the state. Obaseki would contest with Ize-Iyamu in the June 22, 2020 primary, for which the APC has adopted the direct primary mode where all aspirants would test their popularity to secure the governorship ticket ahead of the September 19 election. Mayaki described Ize-Iyamu’s purchase of the nomination form as “another stride in the quest to move Edo State forward.” “By obtaining the form today, we have formally placed our name on the party’s ballot for our primary next month. It is another great stride and we are thankful to the other aspirants who have joined us here today to offer support,” the statement added. Meanwhile, Oshiomhole assured its supporters of a free and fair primary in the governorship race, saying those aspiring for the governorship position of a level playing field during the party primaries. Represented by the National Organising Secretary, Emmanuel Ibediro, he said contrary to insinuations by the PDP, the APC would be more united than ever before after the primary election. “The APC is a party that is given to observing the rule of law, our constitution and the guidelines in all our activities and I want to assure the aspirants that the party will offer every aspirant the level playing ground.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
