Specifically, the stakeholders called for less-cumbersome provisions, digitalisation of processes, proper funding through National Assembly appropriation, expanded tribunal, consultative and participatory processes, among others. Recently, the Chairman, CCB, Mohammed Isah, said the level of compliance with the declaration of assets by public officeholders in the country is not encouraging.  In their recommendation, the experts stressed the need for the full enforcement and observance of extant constitutional and statutory provisions of the Code of Conduct for Public Officers by the CCB.
 
They maintained that there was a need for the National Assembly to amend the constitutional list of public officers for the purpose of assets and liabilities declaration to limit them to a realistic and manageable number.
 
They said: “The ALDF should be digitised to an Online Assets Declaration Framework (OADF), and the jurat in the form should be converted to attestation to remove the unnecessary process of going before a high court judge to make the declaration.
 
“The CCB should adopt the OADF because of a plethora of benefits including ease of compliance for declarants, ease of managing the process for the Bureau, quality control, and improving verification of declarations.”  “The CCB should embark on a consultative and participatory process with key stakeholder groups to develop and propose a Bill to the National Assembly to address the inadequacies and weaknesses in the current system,” Ojo said.
 
He reiterated the need for the Federal Government to establish a CCT in each of the geo-political zones in the country, to deal with cases emanating from the states.  He linked the poor showing to the bureau’s poor funding and understaffing, especially in leadership positions of the organisation. He contended that the CCB Act’s minimum qualification of the organisation’s membership as
“a person of unimpeachable character in the society” was not enough. “There is no educational or professional qualification for being a member of CCB and we are talking of a major agency that needs specialised expertise. It is a multidisciplinary agency that brings in experts from various fields,” Onuoha said.
 
He noted that if anything happens to the Chairman of the Bureau, the CCT would be incapacitated and would not be able to carry out its functions.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
