Margolyes, 78, who is most known to film audiences for her role as Professor Sprout in the “Harry Potter” film series made the shocking comments in a rant on Channel 4 comedy chat show The Last Leg on Friday night. “I had difficulty not wanting Boris Johnson to die. I wanted him to die,” Margolyes said. “Then I thought that will reflect badly on me and I don’t want to be the sort of person that wants people to die. So then I wanted him to get better, which he did do, he did get better. But he didn’t get better as a human being. And I really would prefer that.” Margolyes made the bold comments when she was responding to a question on how the government have dealt with the pandemic, to which actress said: “Appallingly, of course, appallingly. It’s a disgrace, it’s a scandal. It’s a public scandal.” Miriam Margolyes has enjoyed an illustrious acting career. She won a BAFTA Award for her role in Martin Scorsese’s The Age of Innocence (1993) and was cast in the role of Professor Sprout in the Harry Potter film series. Reacting to Margolyes’ comments, TV host Piers Morgan wrote: “Disgusting. This is where toxic tribalism has got us.. actively wanting people of a different political persuasion to die. Shame on you Ms Margoyles.”
