Chieftains of the Akwa Ibom State All Progressive Congress (APC) have cautioned its members against publishing inciting materials on social media, a situation they said was bringing the party to disrepute. They also expressed concern about the action of some members who are still bitter over the outcome of the 2019 general elections, for which they were resorting to smear campaign against some leaders of the party in the state. They urged such persons to sheath their sword in a bid to build a better front ahead of the 2023 general elections. In a statement issued by immediate past secretary of the party, Dr. Efiong Etok and pioneer Akwa Ibom State University council member, Mrs. Glory Effiong, they condemned the media attacks on Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Godswill Akpabio, by media aides of some aggrieved APC members aimed at embarrassing him (Akpabio). “We have read several publications on social media in which the writers have tried to denigrate Akpabio with unfounded allegations and unsubstantiated stories. We insist that these allegations are mere fabrications politically motivated and designed to humiliate the minister. “Former Managing Director of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), Obong Nsima Ekere’s recent confirmation that it was not Akpabio who brought RODNAB Construction Company to the NDDC is quite telling. “Ekere confirmed that the commission contracted RODNAB Construction and paid for constructing NDDC headquarter project during his tenure as MD. His admission discounts the false narratives that have been published against Akpabio on this matter,” the statement reads. They advised APC leaders to redouble efforts for a better outing in 2023 elections instead of fighting among themselves.
