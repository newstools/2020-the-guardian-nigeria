Edo State Government, yesterday, condemned in strong terms the conduct of APC faction’s mock primaries’ through the Edo Peoples Movement (EPM) amid the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. The government also accused the APC National Chairman, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole of heating up the polity following his purported role in the conduct of the APC faction’s mock primaries’ through the Edo Peoples Movement (EPM). In a statement, Secretary to State Government, Osarodion Ogie Esq., alleged that Oshiomhole organised such an event at a time the world was reeling from the havoc of coronavirus, with over 200,000 persons lost to the pandemic. “For Comrade Oshiomhole to organise this sort of gathering at this dark moment of our history as a nation, he has not only shown disregard for the health and safety of Edo people and Nigerians in general, but also proved that he has no regard for the hard-won reputation of our great party. “It is the most despicable of Comrade Oshiomhole to show such insensitivity by spitting on the graves of these people; endangering the lives of millions of Edo people and undermining the efforts of government at the state and national levels to halt the deadly campaign of this invisible enemy.” “Comrade Oshiomhole on Thursday, April 30, 2020, organised what some media outlets have come to term as ‘APC faction’s mock primaries’ in Benin City. The meeting was organised by a group of dissidents who make up the EPM with the active backing of Comrade Oshiomhole, who, it was reported, drew up a delegates list for the exercise. “It must be noted that the gathering held in a house of a member of the EPM, with the attendants numbering over subsisting directives on public gatherings as prescribed by the national and state governments,” Ogie said.
