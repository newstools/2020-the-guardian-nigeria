The palliatives were in line with RCC’s support programme for the vulnerable and poor citizens at the various communities within its project locations across the country. At the events held simultaneously in Nasarawa, Osun, Ogun, Oyo and Enugu states as well as the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, over 2,000 bags each containing 10kg rice, 2kg garri, 2kg semovita, 40x70gr Indomie, 1kg milo, 850g milk, and 3kg cooking oil were distributed through the community leaders. Expressing appreciation for the gesture, President-General, Ameke Ngwo community in Enugu, Chief Augustine Agu, said the gesture could not have come at a better time than now that coronavirus is ravaging the entire world with its attendant hunger, sickness, apprehension and general dislodgement of the socio-economic activities across societies.
