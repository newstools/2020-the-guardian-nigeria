• Urges telcos to upgrade 2G network sites to 3G/4G, invest in alternative power United Nation’s arm in charge of global telecommunications, the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), is worried that rural and remote areas of many countries worldwide continue to be sparsely covered in terms of broadband connectivity.
   
ITU said major challenges for rural and remote area connectivity include inadequate supporting infrastructure, difficult terrain, illiteracy, high cost of installation of information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure, and policy issues. With these challenges, rural and remote areas including those in Nigeria are often not considered viable business cases by telecommunication operators.
   
In Nigeria today, broadband penetration is put at 39.5 per cent with some 75 million of the over 200 million having access to the facility, which largely resides in the urban areas. But in an effort targeted at improving connectivity and spur business growths in Ekiti, the State Government has budgeted N5billion for broadband infrastructure.
   
The Governor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, through his Twitter handle @ekitistategov, announced the plan at the weekend. He had signed an MoU with O’odua Infraco Resources Limited, which is to 606km broadband infrastructure in the state, to be ready by 2021.  “Policy makers are encouraged to ensure that ICT training is incorporated into school curriculum as digital literacy also stimulates demand,” ITU noted. Meanwhile, the Ekiti project is expected to lift the state from 16 per cent Internet penetration to 90 per cent.
  
 According to the Managing Director of O’odua Infraco Resources Limited, Sammy Adigun, the project will be officially flagged off in October and completed within 14 months.
   
This decision is a follow-up to the recent crash of Right of Way charges slash from N4,500 to N145 per meter for broadband infrastructure, and in line with one of the five pillars of Governor Kayode Fayemi’s development plan for Ekiti.
