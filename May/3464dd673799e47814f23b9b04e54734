The Lower Niger Vanguard (LNV) has faulted the composition of the Board of Trustees of Police Trust Fund (PTF), as it does not conform to regional nor zonal balance.
 
LNV, a coalition of Southern and Middle Belt group concerned with equity and good governance in Nigeria, urged the President to re-constitute the board because of its lopsided composition, a brazen attempt at the domination of the country’s security architecture by one zone.
 
In a statement, yesterday, its National Convener, Mike Melah, said they felt scandalised by the present arrangement at the PTF Board of Trustees, where the chairman and executive secretary were from same geopolitical zone.
    
A recent statement released by the Presidency indicated that the former Inspector General of Police, Suleiman Abbah, from Jigawa State is the chairman of PTF Board of Trustees, while Ahmed Aliyu Sokoto from Sokoto State is the Executive Secretary. The duo would work with the Minister of Police Affairs, Muhammad Maigari Dingyadi, also from Sokoto State. “As a pressure group committed to telling the truth to leaders to get them to do the right thing, we urge the President to change this arrangement. It conforms neither to regional nor zonal balance,” the coalition said.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
