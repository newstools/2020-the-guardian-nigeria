Meghan Markle, 38, deactivated her popular site in April 2017 before announcing her engagement to Prince Harry, 35, in November of that year. The Tig, which was launched in 2014, was the actress’ personal blog in which she shared some of her favorite things, ranging from food and travel to fashion, beauty, politics, and inspirational women with her fans. Now, royal expert Myka Meier predicted in the Royally Obsessed podcast that Meghan, who has moved to her hometown of Los Angeles with Harry and 11-month-old Archie, could also open a new Instagram account, after being forced to shut down the Sussex Royal account when they stepped down as a senior royals. Last September it emerged Meghan’s business manager, Andrew Meyer, reportedly filed documents in the US aiming to keep the rights to the blog’s name until 2021. Meyer is said to have used a company called Frim Fram to file The Tig rights-extension documents. Frim Fram is also said to have an affiliated website under it, called ‘Tigtots,’ which is thought to be a site for parents. Meghan’s spokeswoman said that The lasting trademark is to prevent false branding, to avoid others purporting to be the Duchess or affiliated with her. Meghan had said that she named her site The Tig after she tried a wine called Tignanello, which is nicknamed ‘Tig’.
