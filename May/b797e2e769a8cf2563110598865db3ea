The former Deputy Governor of Lagos State, Dr. Idiat Oluranti Adebule, has urged Muslims to use the Ramadan period to pray and work towards a solution to the pandemic Coronavirus ravaging the world. Also, Muslims in the LSDPC Low-Cost Housing Estate, Abesan have lauded the proactive moves of the Lagos State Government to contain the novel coronavirus disease. Adebule, in a message to felicitate with the Muslim world on the commencement of the month long fasting said Ramadan is a period during which God accepts prayers and also a time for spiritual reflection and rebirth, sacrifice and kindness, as well as increased devotion and worship. She said the commencement of Ramadan had provided a unique opportunity for Muslims to support the global effort to end the COVID-19 pandemic with fervent prayers to Allah for mercy. She called on all Muslims to see the occurrence of the coronavirus pandemic and its momentary global impact as a warning from Allah that human need Him for our existence and sustenance and that our human might and power can not withstand the weakest of His trials. She, therefore, urged Muslims, to be more God-conscious, even though movement and congregation is advisedly restricted at this time, we must continue individually and as a nuclear family to continue the observation of our five daily prayers, Taraweeh, increased recitation of the Qur’an, supplications, and remembrance of Allah as well as shunning sinful and inappropriate actions that could aggravate the already bad situation. Ramadan, she said is more importantly a period to display more kindness to fellow humans no matter their religion, race or gender. Meanwhile, President of the Abesan Estate Muslim Community, Mukaila Sanusi, said Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu had shown considerable leadership in the fight against the pandemic, especially in the areas of contact tracing, treatment of infected persons and the building of isolation centres, among others. Sanusi averred that the state government’s welfare measures are also very commendable as the distribution of relief materials to lessen the burden of the lockdown on residents is in line with Islamic ethos relating to welfare of the people. He said that in tandem with the directives of the Lagos State Government and the dictates of the present situation, the Abesan Estate Muslim Community has decided to shut its mosques and suspend its usual programmes during Ramadan. The President maintained that there would be no joint Tarawih prayers, no public lectures or any form of public gatherings whilst the mosques are closed for as long as the prevailing situation remains. He disclosed that the community would leverage technology and social media to bring lectures to its members during the month of Ramadan. “In order to cushion the effects of the lockdown order on Muslims during the fasting period, the Abesan Muslim Community would increase the distribution of its welfare package by an additional 350, so as to extend the gesture to deserving families in the estate as well as direct all the 13 other mosques within the community to do same”, Sanusi stated. He explained that the extension of relief materials to members of the community was being done in line with Allah’s injunction and in realisation of the fact that individuals and organisations need to support the government in bringing relief to all at this trying period. The Chief Imam of Abesan Estate Muslim Community, Imam Muslimdeen Najeemdeen, who doubles as the Chairman of the League of Imams, Mosan-Okunola Local Council Development Area, stated that the Abesan Muslim Community was not alone in the preventive measures taken so far, as it is a reflection of the position of most Muslims in the entire LCDA.
