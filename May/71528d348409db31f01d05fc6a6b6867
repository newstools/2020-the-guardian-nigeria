Unions petition minister over planned appointment of new NIEPA DG The Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria (HURIWA) has sued the Federal Government over the appointment of the Nigeria Police Trust Fund Board of Trustees.In the suit, the plaintiffs, Emmanuel N. Onwubiko and Oniengieofori George are asking the Federal High Court, Abuja to set aside the Federal Government’s appointment and directive to Minister of Police Affairs to set a date for inauguration of the Board, for undermining due process of law. The plaintiffs are also seeking an order directing the Federal Government to reconstitute the Nigeria Police Trust Fund Board of Trustees to reflect federal character. It noted that this should be the case, especially in its Chairman, Executive Secretary and other members of the Board in a manner as to prevent the predominance of persons from a few states or sections of the country. Other defendants in the suit are, Attorney General of the Federation, Minister of Police Affairs, Nigeria Police Council, Nigeria Police Trust Fund, Federal Character Commission and Revenue Mobilisation Allocation and Fiscal Commission (RMAFC). In the suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/534/2020, dated May 27, 2020, the plaintiffs are also asking the court to decide whether in the light of Section 162(3) of the 1999 Constitution and Nigeria Police Trust Fund (Establishment) Act, purporting to include as part of its revenue “an amount constituting 0.5 per cent of the total revenue accruing to the Federation Account,” is not unconstitutional and void. Meanwhile, workers of the National Institute for Education Planning Administration (NIEPA) in Ondo State have raised the alarm over alleged pland by the Ministry of Education to appoint a substantive Director-General for the institute without following due process. The workers, under the auspices of the Joint Research and Allied Institutions Sector Unions, NIEPA chapter, petitioned the Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu over what they described as illegality and misconduct in the institute. They alleged that an authorised recommendation had been forwarded to the Minister for the DG’s position without the consent of the institute’s Governing Council vested with powers to make recommendations for the post. In a petition dated May 15, 2020, chairmen of the organised labour unions in the institution, Bibitayo Ajise (ASURI), Ganiyu Toyin (NASU) and Solomon Ogudo (SSAUTHRIAI) demanded due process in the appointment of a DG for the institute. “In view of this information, the three unions of NIEPA strongly condemned such unauthorised recommendation of an outsider to the DG position without the knowledge of the Governing Council that has such mandate,” they said.
