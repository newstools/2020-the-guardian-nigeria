– Creates 202 collection centres across the state As the Federal Government kicked off the modified Homegrown School Feeding Programme, the Executive Chairman of the Lagos State Universal Basic Education Board (LSUBEB), Wahab Olawale Alawiye-King, said the board would commence the home-feeding programme in Lagos State next week. Alawiye-King, who disclosed this yesterday at the Nigerian Air Force Base Warehouse in Ikeja where the items for beneficiary households were being housed and packaged, said the Federal Government felt that the programme must continue despite the closure of the schools. “So, the Ministry of Humanitarian, Disaster Management and Social Development, in collaboration with the state government through the LSUBEB and other agencies had been working for the past four weeks to ensure that the directive is carried out. That is what we are doing here today. We have identified all the households that are going to benefit from this and the programme would kick off next week,” he said. He said that Lagos State is targeting about 37,000 households, adding: “The description and identification of the households had been carried out and an household is a father, mother and three kids. And we are giving 5kg of rice and beans each, palm and groundnut oil, two sachet of tomato paste, half crate of eggs and salt to an household,” Alawiye-King said about 202 collection centres had been set up and each centre covers a number of schools depending on the size of the local council education district. “We have identified the households in each area and we would give each household a voucher a day before to go and redeem the voucher to get the items.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
