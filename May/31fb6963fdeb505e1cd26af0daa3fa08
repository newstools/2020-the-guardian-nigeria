To save you from the fashion jury, here are some quick fixes that children can learn while at home: <img class="aligncenter wp-image-1162184 size-full lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Color-Wheel-Challenge.-Photo-Teach-Kids-Art.png" alt="" width="1080" height="1080" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Color-Wheel-Challenge.-Photo-Teach-Kids-Art.png 1080w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Color-Wheel-Challenge.-Photo-Teach-Kids-Art-598x598.png 598w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Color-Wheel-Challenge.-Photo-Teach-Kids-Art-100x100.png 100w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Color-Wheel-Challenge.-Photo-Teach-Kids-Art-200x200.png 200w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Color-Wheel-Challenge.-Photo-Teach-Kids-Art-487x487.png 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Color-Wheel-Challenge.-Photo-Teach-Kids-Art-974x974.png 974w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Color-Wheel-Challenge.-Photo-Teach-Kids-Art-240x240.png 240w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Color-Wheel-Challenge.-Photo-Teach-Kids-Art-480x480.png 480w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Color-Wheel-Challenge.-Photo-Teach-Kids-Art-600x600.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /> Now we know children are not so bothered about matching their clothes. If you let them, they’d repeat their favourite piece, the same ones they literally soiled yesterday. This is the best time to teach them to play around with colours. A colour wheel unlocks the magic you seek. Using the colour wheel, let them pick their favourite colours and match them with other colours. Then, show them how to match those colours using their clothes. This way, they can quickly learn how to match outfits. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-1162185 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Colourful-Lama-nose-mask.-Photo-Amazon.png" alt="" width="1280" height="785" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Colourful-Lama-nose-mask.-Photo-Amazon.png 760w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Colourful-Lama-nose-mask.-Photo-Amazon-487x299.png 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Colourful-Lama-nose-mask.-Photo-Amazon-320x196.png 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Colourful-Lama-nose-mask.-Photo-Amazon-640x392.png 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Colourful-Lama-nose-mask.-Photo-Amazon-600x368.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> What better way to think of being a hero than now? Make them feel like their favourite hero (you know, the one that wears a mask). To achieve this, all you need are a thread, a needle and a fabric. Make it a fun learning session for them. Start by teaching them how to pass the thread into the needle hole. Worried about how this might turn out? Now is the time to know that the little man and/or woman was born a creative genius. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-1162186 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Mum-and-child-wearing-head-wraps.-Photo-Pinterest-598x598.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="1280" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Mum-and-child-wearing-head-wraps.-Photo-Pinterest-598x598.jpg 598w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Mum-and-child-wearing-head-wraps.-Photo-Pinterest-100x100.jpg 100w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Mum-and-child-wearing-head-wraps.-Photo-Pinterest-200x200.jpg 200w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Mum-and-child-wearing-head-wraps.-Photo-Pinterest-487x487.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Mum-and-child-wearing-head-wraps.-Photo-Pinterest-240x240.jpg 240w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Mum-and-child-wearing-head-wraps.-Photo-Pinterest-480x480.jpg 480w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Mum-and-child-wearing-head-wraps.-Photo-Pinterest-600x600.jpg 600w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Mum-and-child-wearing-head-wraps.-Photo-Pinterest.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> This is the perfect time to try out all the fashion tips and proper dress codes they have learned from all those times spent watching fashion shows on the TV and the internet. Encourage them to knot hair wraps and their ties. Let fashion be their playground this Children’s day.
