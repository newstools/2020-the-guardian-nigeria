The Nigeria Police, yesterday, arraigned one Afobaje Maiyegun, alias Afobaje, before a Lagos Magistrate’s Court in Igbosere for allegedly beating up his wife, Mariam Omolara Gabriel. Maiyegun, who had, after the incident, posted her photograph showing her bruised face online, boasting in a viral Facebook post that he had just beaten up his wife, was arraigned on a two-count charge of unlawful assault before Magistrate Folake Oshin. He pleaded not guilty to the offence.
The Police prosecutor, Shinaolu Adeoye, told the court that the defendant committed the offence on May 5, this year at Maiyegun Town, Jakande Estate in Eti-Osa Council. He further disclosed that the offence was contrary to and punishable under Section 173 and Section 57 (1a) of the Criminal Law of Lagos State. The prosecutor prayed the court to remand the defendant, while asking for a date to commence trial.But the defendant’s Counsel, Mustapha Danesi, urged the court to grant his client bail in the most liberal terms, as the matter is a family crisis. Magistrate Oshin thereafter granted the defendant bail in the sum of N500, 000, with two sureties who must be a cleric and his family member. She ordered the court Registrar to verify the addresses of the sureties, who must be taxpayers in the state, and subsequently adjourned trial to June 22, this year. Part of the charge read: “That you, Sulaiman Maiyegun, alias Afobaje, on 05/05/2020, at about 12:13m, at No 9. Maiyegun Town, off Lekki Road, Jakande Estate in Eti-Osa Local Government Area, within Lagos Magistrate District, did unlawfully assault one Mariam Omolara Gabriel with fist blow and caused her injury on her forehead and thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 173 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
