Indian marriage | The Conversation His mother sent him out grocery shopping but she got more than she bargained for when he returned home with a woman he claimed was his wife. According to a report by India’s ANI news agency, the unidentified Indian mother was left shocked when her son whom she sent out to buy groceries returned with an unknown woman and said she was his wife. The emotional mother from Uttar Pradesh’s Ghaziabad city said the shock was too much for her and she was unable to accept their union. She said: “I had sent my son to do the grocery shopping today, but when he returned, he came back with his wife. I am not ready to accept this marriage,” the woman said, according to the Hindustan Times. It is learned that the newlyweds had tied the knot in a secret wedding some months back with the bride living alone in a rented apartment in Delhi. The groom had intentions of telling his mother about the union later on but the COVID-19 lockdown ruined the plans. Savita, his wife, was apparently asked to vacate the rented accommodation in Delhi, so he had to bring her home to his mother. The man says, “We performed our marriage in a temple today & priest said that he would help us get marriage certificate once #lockdown is lifted. Today I decided to bring her to my mother’s house as she was told to leave the rented accommodation due to lockdown,” 26-year-old Guddu said. “We could not get the marriage certificate at that time due to lack of witnesses. I had decided to visit Haridwar again but could not due to the lockdown.” As the newlyweds could not convince the groom’s mother to let them stay in her house, police stepped in to help and asked Savita’s landlord in Delhi to let them stay in the rented accommodation until they can find something better, or until the scorned mother comes around.
