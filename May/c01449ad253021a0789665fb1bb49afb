With millions working from home due to the coronavirus pandemic, there are fears among realtors that many companies could continue to cut costs and spend less on renting office space after the health crisis.
   
With the emergence of the coronavirus, most businesses opted to operate remotely as governments/authorities declared a sit-at-home protocols, as well as physical distancing culture to contain the spread of the pandemic.
 
As of April 28, 2020 more than 3.06 million cases have been reported across 185 countries, and territories, resulting in over 213,000 deaths and few recoveries from the novel infectious disease. 
 
Some of the sector operators believed that even if the disease spread cease momentarily, adjusting to previous business model where people gather in large numbers in offices may be a mirage, couple with the reality that Covid-19 experience has opened up knowledge to executives on possibility of working remotely with gains especially reduction in the cost of running business operations.  The growth of remote working has been driven by technology, with zoom and other teleconferencing platform encouraging proximity while living in tens of thousands miles apart, traditional office’s popularity may pass its peak as financial pressures could drive businesses to seek smaller, more flexible and cheaper offices. 
   
Speaking with The Guardian, a real estate practitioner and member of trustees of the Nigerian Institution of Estate Surveyors and Valuers (NIESV), Dr. Austin Otegbulu said businesses and offices may require less space against the practice in the past. As a result, he said rents may go down for a while for office letting.
 
He posited that by the experiences of the COVID-19, ‘people are not able to mix up again, work in their offices and interact through physical businesses, works have to be done whether we like it or not and so the use of digital platform for business has come en-vogue and deployed remotely.
   
According to him, this, translate to the fact that a lot of businesses will go digital working remotely to save cost and people would like to minimise their expenditures. He said people might likely adopt perpetual working from home and would choose to come to offices, once in a while to interact when absolutely necessary.  NIESV past President, Chief Emeka Onuorah said, there might be depression in the property market be it commercial and all kinds of real estate. However, he expressed doubt about any major shift in letting market in the near future due to remote working because businesses will still continue.
Instead, he said there could be defaults in the payment of rents for commercial lettings as a result of the economic setback caused by CoVID-9.
   
Onuorah said, “The market will never be the same again, the way businesses will be done will involve more use of information technology and marketing of properties. Basically technology will assume more serious proportion in the real estate industry and remote working will only be in the short term, it can’t last because working at home also requires some technology. “For those in the private sector how many people can effectively work from home. It is only few organisations like banks can provide technology for people to work at home. It will take a while before people could adapt to such culture and I don’t see it as a trend in the near future”.
“It thus appears that the idea of remote working is not going to continue following the speech of president and things will start easing off soon.” 
 
The Chairman, NIESV chapter, Niger State, Dr. Kemiki Olurotimi Adebowale, observed that transactions are still going on, in the commercial space, tenants are still paying rents and operators are in the era of digitalisation wherein they could call on phone, collect rents by mobile transfer for high profile buildings. He said, “The only way it might impact heavily on the sector is when the culture of working remotely is extended to about six months.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
