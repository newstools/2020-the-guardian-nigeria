 Members of the Rotary Club of Agege handing over the medical equipment to Orile Agege PHC  The Rotarians were led by their president, Rtn. Emmanuel Eneh, to the two centres with donations that included 6KVA generating set and digital weighing scales for infant and adult, among others to help the maternity centres in effective healthcare delivery for citizens at the grassroots. Eneh noted that support for healthcare practitioners was very important as the medical professionals battle endlessly to flatten the curve of the coronavirus pandemic, even to the detriment of their own safety. He also advised against self-medication in the hurried bid to protect themselves against coronavirus. “It is not easy with the enormous demand expected of them from the society at large. And as all attention shifts towards those on the frontlines at the isolation centres and general hospitals, we decided to also remember the PHCs in our communities rendering invaluable services to citizens at the grassroots,” he said. Receiving the items, the Medical Officer of Health at Orile Agege LCDA, Dr. Shosanya, thanked the club for their timely gesture. The project director of the club, Rtn. Ajibade, said the donations were made possible through a District Grant. Also, the club made some donation of food items as part of COVID-19 palliative to Rotary Community Corps (RCC) in the area. Members of the RCC are community leaders and humanirarian workers who partner with the Rotary Club of Agege to deliver on some of the development projects needed in the area.
