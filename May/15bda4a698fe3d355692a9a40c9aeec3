The Health Community Liaison Manager of Midwestern Oil, Mr. Williams Eboh, while presenting the items to the State Government on behalf of the companies, said the gesture was in response to the governor’s clarion call for support by organisations and well-spirited individuals in the fight against the disease. Eboh, who listed the food items donated to include, 270 bags of 50kg rice, 135 cartons of groundnut oil, 270 cartons of noodles and 180 cartons of tin tomatoes, disclosed that the cluster comprises eight oil firms; Midwestern, Sun Trust, Newcross, Platform, Energia, Oando, Chorus and Pillar Oil Limited operating in the state.  “The Governor, Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa, appreciates this contribution, and what you have brought here would be put into good use. We have done the first tranche of palliatives, which went down to the grassroots.
We are planning the second tranche, so what you brought will help in no small measure.” On his part, Chairman, the State Medical Related Donations for COVID-19 Response, Dr Austin Obidi, and his team, who received the Nissan Pick-Up van and facemasks on behalf of the state government, also thanked the donors.
