Uwa was said to have visited the RCCG, Edo Province 10, Ikpoba Hill, Benin to read on Wednesday, May 27, 2020. She was reported to be in the church auditorium when some men attacked her, raped her, hit her head with a fire extinguisher cylinder then left her for dead. The lady died after three days in the hospital as a result of the injury sustained. Nigerians took to their social media to demand justice and seek that the state government brings the culprit to book. Below are some of the reactions.
