A member of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) has urged Nigerian youths to stop expecting ‘everything’ from the government and instead contribute to the development of the country. The NYSC member, Andra Daniel, an indigene of Bauchi State made the call while donating his April allowance to the state governor, Bala Mohammed, to support the fight against Covid-19 pandemic on Wednesday in Bauchi. Daniel, who is from Bogoro local government area of the state, said the government has done its best while calling on individuals’ support to assist the state. “When situation like this is before a nation I believe it is a collective responsibility. Government cannot do everything. What we need now at this time is what we can do to help Nigeria,” Daniel said. Daniel explained that he withdrew his allowance for the month of April and give to the governor who he said handed it over to the Bauchi State taskforce on Covid-19.
