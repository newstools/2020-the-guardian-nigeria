There are strong indications that the Kano State Government might lift the successive lockdown of human and vehicular movement imposed as part of measures to curtail the spread of the deadly COVID-19 pandemic. Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, who gave the indication at a press briefing yesterday in Kano, stressed that no countryâ€™s economic would strive under the present lockdown regime. The state government has declared three weeks total lockdown, besides the two weeks stay-at-home order issued by the federal government.Ganduje, last week, however, announced the relaxation of the presidential lockdown for six hours on Mondays and Thursdays to enable residents stockpile food and drugs. The government action to allow movement and keep market places open for two days of the week attracted public criticisms, especially from those that believed such decision could further trigger cases of coronavirus in the state. But reacting to a question on lack of strict compliance with the stay-at-home order, Ganduje said policies involving the life and death of citizenry require optimum caution, adding that government had no choice than to continue appealing to residents to observe all safety measures against the virus. The governor, who disclosed that the state government would soon enforce compulsory use of facemask in public places and strict compliance to Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) protocols as part of life practices in Kano, disclosed that government would soon review the stay-at-home policy. Kano has so far recorded 753 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with 633 active cases, 87 patients so far recovered and discharged, with 33 deaths recorded.
