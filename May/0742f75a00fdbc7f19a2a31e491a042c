These words kept ringing in my head long after this conversation happened! I know those words were determination and a no hold barred kind of spirit to achieving greatness by all cost! Lisa George may not be a household name now but she’s sure of being a force to reckon with and in a matter of time, you will remember these words! We had a lockdown conversation with the ODO crooner Lisa George and it was quite interesting. Have a read. Music seems to be the easy way out for youths of nowadays, do we say it’s the same for you? Smile! I beg to differ and that’s because I have been doing music since a very tender age of seven and although that might sound cliche, I make bold to say music has always been a part of me and I am not joining the bandwagon of youth that feels it’s an easy way out! What differentiates you from every other female singer? What makes me different is that I am Lisa George and that alone is a huge win for me. I am blessed with a different kind of sound and a message that cannot be ignored. Let’s talk about the music industry for a few seconds, what’s your take on the rival amongst the female singers? When there’s no healthy competition, the game isn’t interesting. However, we should not allow certain influences and personal vendetta gets the best part of us. Some school of thoughts believe that a little beef helps the industry but when it becomes a violent kind of situation, we should know when to call it off. Odo, your newest project, talk about it! Odo like you know it means love the sound is all about spreading positivity & more of love than hate. You have been in the industry for how long? A couple of years now but professional 2years. And how has the experience been thus far? My experience so far has been a blend of both worlds. I have had my own fair share of ups and downs and being here has made me realize that there are vultures waiting eagerly to take full advantage of my inexperience as far as how the industry works and that has helped me to “shine my eye well well” as it has been an eye-opener for me and has also made me wiser. It’s also an everyday learning experience and I am happy for both the good, bad, ugly because they all have contributed to making my brand stronger. What’s your plan for the brand Lisa George? It is every brand’s dream to remain consistent and bankable no matter what and I don’t intend to be left behind as far as Lisa George is concerned. I might not be a household name at the moment, but in a matter of time, I will be on everyone’s lips! That’s the plan and prayer. Female nudity in videos and seductive lyrics, what’s your take on it? I believe as a lady, you can dress all decent and still look good and sexy without going nude in videos. I am not a fan of nudity and I would never be found guilty of such in any of my contents. The grateful EP, take us on the journey of making that happen. Grateful Ep is my official first body of work and it contains 5 great songs that are so personal to me. Track 1 which is grateful, talks show my gratitude to God for the journey thus far both personally and in my career and it also doubles as the title of the EP. Track 2 – Girls Abre which means girls are tired, in Ghana language. I am more of an advocate for woman, girls and the girl-child and I believe it is high time girls arise and take their rightful place in the society. Track 3, ODO, which means love, also happens to be the current song I am pushing at the moment with the audio and video disturbing the airwaves as we speak. It’s a song that talks about spreading positive vibe and enjoying life moderately. Track 4. African woman. This one is personal to me because it talks about domestic violence. I feel depressed each time I read or hear about the maltreatment of another female or I read about the abuse women face both sexually, domestically and all sort and to think that it is becoming a norm in our society today, that, I feel very bad and that was what gave birth to that song as I had to pour out my heart vocally. Track 5 which is the last but not the least is Love is sweet. This song is one that everyone in love can relate with aside from the fact that it has a different kind of vibe. There’s nobody that will be genuine in love and not want to go over the moon just to put smiles on their partners face and let the world know that “we die here” kinda feeling! So in all, the GRATEFUL Ep is one birthed from a place of deep reflection of my feelings and vibe and I just had to put it out in a complete body of work also bearing in mind that the message of hope, love and positivity must reflect as well.
