The Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMet) Regional Training Centre, Oshodi, has been elected as member of the World Meteorological Organisation’s Executive Council Capacity Development Panel (WMO-CDP).
 
This feat, according to the Director-General/CEO NiMet, Prof. Sani Abubakar Mashi, is worth mentioning because out of the 24 Meteorological Regional Training Centres in the world, four from each of the six continents, NiMet is the only one elected by WMO into the 12-member panel to represent all the Regional Training Centres in the world.
   
In a statement made available by the General Manager, Corporate Communications, NiMet, Yusuf Ibrahim, quoted Mashi as saying that the feat is worthy of celebration, as it is a clear and positive indication of the aggressive reforms the Aviation Minister, Hadi Sirika, has been championing in the Nigerian aviation sector.
   
The Director of the Meteorological Regional Training Centre, Prof. Peter Odjugo, is to serve as the representative of the Centre at the Panel. The work of the panel, Mashi revealed, will include support institutional, infrastructural, procedural, and human resources capacity development activities of WMO, with the intention of closing the gap between less developed and developed countries.
   
He said: “The Panel will normally meet each year and make effective use of remote coordination and collaboration.“The implication of this development is that NiMet is further strengthened to assist sister meteorological institutions in Africa, particularly in the area of human and infrastructural capacity development, thus consolidating in its leadership role in the continent.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
