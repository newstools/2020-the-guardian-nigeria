Joyner Lucas has made a remix of “Will”, his tribute to Will Smith which he released back in March 2020 and the remix features none other than the Fresh Prince himself. On the remix of “Will”, Smith whose last album “Lost and Found” was released 15 years ago, name-checks a few icons that he also respects: “You feelin’ like me? I feel like a prince that turned to a king
 Found me a queen, started a family and got me a team
 On top of my dreams, Joyner, I know you inspired by me
 Like I was inspired by Nelson Mandela, I give him a rose for every endeavor
 And shoutout to Julius Erving, one of the legends I worship
 Muhammad Ali put the work in, he was the champ, the greatest, he earned it
 I love that you think that I’m perfect but I have plenty mistakes and burdens”  In March, Joyner Lucas released the original version along with a video in which the rapper morphs into different Will Smith’s characters from some of his most popular films, including The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Bad Boys, Men in Black, Pursuit of Happyness and even Smith’s animated character Oscar from Shark Tale. Will Smith responded via a video published on his Instagram story that he is humbled and honoured: “Joyner Lucas. That joint is crazy. Dude, I am humbled and honoured. One of the lines you’re saying in there, ‘You inspire people and you don’t even know it.’ It has been my intention from day one to really go into the world and just put positive energy and to be able to use my creation to inspire and elevate and empower. I just love what you’ve done, it’s creative. Brother again, humbled and hope to meet you one day.”
