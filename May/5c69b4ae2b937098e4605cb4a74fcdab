The 29-year-old, who starred in FX’s “Baskets,” was found dead in Mayfield, Ky., on Tuesday after allegedly shooting a woman at a residence. In a news by E!News, Mayfield Police Department in Kentucky says that authorities responded to a 911 call Tuesday evening shortly after 5:45 p.m. When officers arrived at the residence, they met Erica Price who had gunshot wounds to her arm and chest. According to police, the 34-year-old was able to tell officers that the gunman was Hagen Mills. She also told authorities he was still inside and had turned the gun on himself. Through an investigation, police learned that Erica’s mom and young daughter, who she shared with Hagen, were held in the residence by Hagen. When Erica entered the residence, police say she was shot by Hagen before he turned the gun on himself. Although Erica was transported to a local hospital for treatment and is currently listed in stable condition, Hagen was pronounced dead at the scene. Erica’s mother and her daughter suffer no harm. Mills was born and raised in Kentucky before moving to Los Angeles to pursue acting. Mills began acting in short films in 2011. In 2013, he appeared in the television movie “Bonnie & Clyde: Justified,” playing Buck Barrow, the older brother of Clyde Barrow and a member of the Barrow Gang.
