 Nigeria Immigration Service PHOTO:Twitter  In a communique signed by the public relations officer of the NIS, Sunday James yesterday, gradual resumption of activities involving the public such as the issuance of passports to those who were captured before the lockdown is strictly by invitation from passports officers. It also states that In order  to clear the backlog, giving credence to improved service delivery and satisfaction, those whose passports are ready for pick-up would be  invited through Short Messages Service (SMS), to come and get the document, therefore, admittance into the passport premises is strictly by invitation “Any applicant that did not receive an SMS invitation need not go to the passport office to avoid denial of entry. The service looks forward to the cooperation of all concern. The standard practice, for now, is that, in states where the restriction of movement has been eased and people have easy movement, applicants are invited through SMS and given a date to report for the collection of their passport. This would reduce the crowd and massive turn-out witnessed in passports offices in the past. The service hopes to maintain a robust and more enhanced process and procedures to ensure seamless, self-serving and tracking process by applicants in the new order.”
“All passport applicants are urged to adhere strictly to the National Centre for Diseases Control, (NCDC) standard of keeping to social and physical distancing, washing of hands with soap and water at the entrance of the passport offices, use of hand sanitizers, and wearing of face mask when visiting any of the passport offices on appointment.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
