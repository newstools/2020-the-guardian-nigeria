• GSMA sees Nigeria leads SSA to new 170m subscribers in five years
Telecommunications sector in Nigeria and other sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), are said to have seen some 20 per cent increase in both data and voice revenues in the last two months.
   
The Global System for Mobile telecommunications Association (GSMA), which revealed this, attributed the increase to the lockdown imposed by various governments in the region to curtail the spread of the rampaging coronavirus pandemic.
   
GSMA, which represents the interest of over 800 telecoms operators and vendors across the globe, said the lockdown forced people to work from home, remotely and virtually, the process of which spurred increased use of data.
   
Head, GSMA Africa, Akinwale Goodluck, who disclosed this to some select journalists across Africa, including The Guardian, via Zoom, said the sector responded adequately well to the pandemic by providing communication options for subscribers across the globe.  According to him, high populations magnify the effect. He said India alone accounts for 860 million of the unconnected globally.
