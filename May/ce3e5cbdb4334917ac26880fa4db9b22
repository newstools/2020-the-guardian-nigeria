 Schalke’s US midfielder Weston McKennie (1st-R) wears an armband reading “Justice for George” during the German first division Bundesliga football match FC Schalke 04 v SV Werder Bremen on May 30, 2020 at the Veltins Arena in Gelsenkirchen, western Germany. – The policeman accused of killing unarmed African American George Lloyd in the US city of Minneapolis has been taken into custody, a state official announced Friday. Derek Chauvin, who was seen in an explosive video pressing his knee to the neck of handcuffed Floyd for at least five minutes on Monday, was arrested earlier Friday, said John Harrington, Commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Public Safety.

Derek Chauvin was charged Friday with one count of third-degree murder — unintentionally causing a death — and one count of negligent manslaughter. McKennie’s USA team-mate Jozy Altidore, who plays for FC Toronto, saluted the Schalke player. “Salute lil bro,” tweeted Altidore. McKennie is the latest American sports star to add his voice to the protests after US tennis player Coco Gauff on Friday posted “Am I next?” on a TikTok video on her Twitter feed. McKennie grew up in Texas, but spent part of his childhood in Germany and joined Schalke as a junior from Dallas Academy in 2016. He has made 19 appearances for the United States national team since 2017.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
