Toke Makinwa | The Eagle Online Nigerian media personality and entrepreneur Toke Makinwa has revealed in a social media post that she pays her tithe because it is a way of partnering with God. The “On Becoming” author opined that paying of tithes is a personal journey or conviction. She wrote in a tweet: ”The power of “first fruit”, while I think paying tithes/giving your first fruit is a personal journey/conviction, I can’t help but boast in God. Every business venture I have ever gone into, I pay my first fruit not because he needs it, but it’s my way of partnering with God.” The issue of tithing has been a heated debate especially in Nigeria following a call out by Nigerian media personality Daddy Freeze. Daddy Freeze who is the convener of the Free The Sheeple Movement has been on an anti-tithing protest, campaigning not just against the payment of 10% but also against seed sowing and first fruits. Severally, he has called out many prominent Nigerian pastors and clergymen for their stand on tithing and offerings. The controversial personality uses the scriptures to show why pastors should be giving tithe not accepting it. In one of his teachings against collections by religious leaders, he says: “Money is a byproduct of love, of seeking God, a byproduct of success… In the Free Nation, we are distilling for love, seeking God, the fruits of the spirit and by the time you get all these things, at the end of the day, money will come in.” According to Freeze, the Levitical tithe is not sacred. In fact, he says, it is “bullocks, bull” because it is based on the Torah, which is the law. His teachings and opinions  have been met with mixed reactions, while some agree with him, many others slam him as being blasphemous and trying to lead people astray from God.
