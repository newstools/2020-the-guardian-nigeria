Godwin Obaseki made this disclosure on his official twitter handle. Obaseki said the patients, who had fully recovered, tested negative twice for the virus and were cleared from the isolation centres. According to the governor, the total number of cleared and discharged patients in the state now stands at 69 with the newly discharged patients.
