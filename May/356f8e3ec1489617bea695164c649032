Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital (AKTH) will resume clinical consultation of all specialty clinics tomorrow, six weeks after their suspension. The teaching hospital shut down virtually all critical services, except emergency unit, dialysis and few others after 50 of its medical staff tested positive for COVID-19 pandemic, while treating unsuspected carriers. Chief Medical Director of the hospital, Professor Abdurrahman Abba Sheshe, disclosed the planned reopening, while receiving donation of medical consumables and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) worth N16m by Kano based Concern Group. Sheshe, who had announced the discharge of 40 AKTH doctors from isolation, having won the battle against the virus, noted that items donated would reduce acute shortage of consumables threatening service delivery to patients. While acknowledging that the state had witnessed many deaths in recent past, due to absence of proper health care services, he assured the donor the items would be judicious utilised. A representative of the donor, Sani Umar, explained that the group found it necessary to contribute their widowâ€™s mite to complement efforts and ease the overstretched capacity of the hospital management. Umar, who regretted acute shortage of essential facilities needed at the hospital to protected medical staff, called for concerted supports for the hospital to enhance its services.
