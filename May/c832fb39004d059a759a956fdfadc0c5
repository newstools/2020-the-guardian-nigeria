Even so, Mr Izala has the constitutional rights to criticize any elected official as guaranteed in section 39 of 1999 constitution which states that: “Every person shall be entitled to freedom of expression, including the freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart ideas and information without interference”. Statement reads in part: “We condemn the shameful act of impunity and abuse of office by President Buhari’s led government and Katsina state governor, Aminu Masari over the arrest, detention and sentence of a 70-year-old Bala Izala and two others for allegedly ‘Insulting’ the President and governor Aminu Bello Masari” “Mr Izala had said he spoke out of anger when he visited his village and found out that bandits had killed his family members and rustled 15 of his cows” “Though some kind-hearted Nigerians were able to pay the option of fine slammed on Mr Izala in securing his release, it is important to note that this is a gross abuse of power by the authorities” “We, therefore, call on the Nigerian government to faithfully discharge their constitutional responsibility and stop jailing critics.’ To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
