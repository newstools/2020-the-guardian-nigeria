A Group, Association of Ebonyi State Indigenes in the Diaspora (AESID) has called on the Inspector-General of Police, Mr. Mohammed Adamu and Director-General of the Department of State Security Services (DSS), Mr. Yusuf Magaji Bichi to wade into alleged politically-motivated killings in Asaga Owutu Edda in Afikpo South Local Council of the state. AESID also called on the state government to institute an independent Judicial Panel of Inquiry to investigate the issue to find a lasting solution. AESID Chairman, Ambassador Pascal Oluchukwu, in a statement, in Abuja, condemned what he described as “the acts of banditry, terrorism and killings, which have been imposed on Edda clan.” The group claimed the denigration of Edda politics to this level of outright and shameless political criminality dates back to 2007, when people of doubtful character entered into Edda/Ebonyi political horizon, as “political adventurers and merchants of death. ” “The recent killings in Edda reflect the brutal and crude political culture of violence and blood-bath, which have been used as an instrument of political domination of the area. It is an extension of the regime of terror, thuggery, intimidation and gangsterism…” it said. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
