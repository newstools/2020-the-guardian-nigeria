Burna Boy, Davido and Aloma A few days ago, Nigerian singers Davido and Burna Boy were trending on microblogging platform Twitter but it wasn’t for a good reason. Burna Boy was under heavy fire for alleged rivalry towards Davido’s whom he reportedly dissed because of his father’s wealth. This came after the latter declared himself and fellow music sensation Wizkid as the greatest artistes of all time. Sources close to the growing beef allege that the issue has been on since Burna Boy released his album, African Giant in 2019 and peaked after Burna Boy lost the Best World Music Album category to Angelique Kidjo. In an update, Davido’s personal assistant Aloma has issued stern warnings to Burna Boy whom he alleged is trying to bite the hands that feed him. In a video post, Aloma alleges that Davido put his performance at One African Music Fest on the line after Burna Boy was denied access. Aloma goes on to allege that Burna Boy is ungrateful and he (Aloma) is ready to “come for” Burna Boy if he keeps on hating. Aloma also advises that hating on another person is not the right way to grow. Check out the video from Aloma’s Instagram Live below:  Aloma has been very open and candid about Davido’s role in his life saying that the latter lifted him from nothing. Aloma expressed gratitude to Davido when the wealthy singer gifted him a brand new house and a sleek Mercedez Benz GLK 350. According to Aloma, Davido helped him to establish his own business after giving him a million naira to celebrate his birthday. Aloma in a recent IG live session said he would rather be the singer’s houseboy than a bank manager. Aloma who complained that people are usually tagging him Davido’s houseboy admitted that being a houseboy to the sensational singer is far better than occupying the position of a bank manager.
