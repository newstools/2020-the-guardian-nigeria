 Ekiti State Governor Kayode Fayemi (right) and Commander, Federal Road Safety Commission (FRSC), Femi Adeoye (rtd), during the appointment of the latter as Ambassador of Quarantine in the state… yesterday.  Fayemi also made the retired Federal Road Safety Commission (FRSC) officer a member of the state’s COVID-19 taskforce, which the governor is heading as chairman. Adeoye shot into limelight when a video of him insisting that his son that returned to Ekiti State from a trip outside the state be isolated for 14 days as stipulated by Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) protocol for preventing community spread of COVID-19 went viral. The governor, who commended Adeoye for his patriotism and selflessness, assured him that his son would soon be released to him after the 14 days quarantine. Adeoye expressed his appreciation to the state government and to the governor for recognising his little contribution towards the drive to end the pandemic in the country. He said people should not see him as a wicked father but someone who believed that the nation is greater than an individual, adding that he did what he did for the collective good of all.
