Enugu State has emerged as the state with the highest number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the South East region, as the state government confirmed its 12th positive case yesterday. So far, Ebonyi has eight cases, Imo has three, Abia has two, while Anambra has one. In Enugu, two cases had been treated and discharged while 10 positive cases were receiving treatment.
The state government, however, said all reported confirmed cases have had travel history, even as it encouraged efforts to minimise inter-state movements. State Commissioner for Health, Dr. Ikechukwu Obi, said in a statement that the new case was from Ebonyi State and that she was married and lived in Enugu, adding that she had been in Kano for the past two months, but returned to Enugu on May 4, 2020. Meanwhile, the Ebonyi State Government said it has concluded arrangements to send 6,000 bags of 5kg rice and N15m as palliatives to its indigenes in Lagos and the Federal Capital Territory (Abuja), to cushion the effect of coronavirus. Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Uchenna Orji, who disclosed this in Abakaliki, said the state governmentâ€™s gesture was to assist its indigenes in Lagos and Abuja, who might have been affected in one way or another by the pandemic. Orji, who is also Acting Commissioner for Human Capital Development, explained that those in Lagos would receive 4,000 (5kg) bags of rice and N10m, while those in the FCT would get 2000 bags and N5m.
