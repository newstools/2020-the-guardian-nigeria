The appointment of a new chief of staff comes almost a month the former chief of staff to Buhari, Abba Kyari, died. Abba Kyari held the position 75-year-old Gambari is expected to fill. Kyari died last month after weeks of battling COVID-19. Buhari described Kyari as a friend, brother. His death opened a new wave of hope for other close allies of the president – Kingibe, former Ogun State Governor Ibikunle Amosun and others who reportedly fancied Kyari’s office. The hopes of the ‘throne’ admirers look buried on Tuesday evening with multiple sources insisting that Buhari had opted to replace late Kyari with Gambari, another trusted ally.
