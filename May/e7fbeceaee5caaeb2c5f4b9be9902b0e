In Friday's daily update, France reported 93 fewer patients suffering from the coronavirus in intensive care, dropping the total to 2,868. The figure rose above 7,000 at the peak of the country's epidemic in April. Over the previous 24 hours, 111 coronavirus-linked deaths were recorded in hospitals and 132 in nursing homes. Nationwide, there were 22,274 patients in hospital with COVID-19.
