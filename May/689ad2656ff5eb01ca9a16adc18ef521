Kaduna State Governor Nasir El-Rufai has disclosed that 10 members of a family have tested positive for COVID-19, just as the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) announced 18 new cases in the state. El-Rufai, who disclosed this yesterday on his verified Twitter handle, said 14 of the new cases were from Kaduna North, two from Zaria and one each from Chikun and Sabon-Gari Councils. He appealed to residents to adhere strictly to safety measures put in place to check the spread of the virus in the state. In an official response to the strike notice by health workers in the state, the governor threatened to sack any health worker that embarks on strike over salary deduction, saying he would regard any worker who failed to show up at his or her assigned place of work as having forfeited his or her employment, saying it was instructive that the strike notice was announced on the same day that many health workers were showing evidence on social media of the N450, 000 they had received as April 2020 incentive. Meanwhile, officials of the state government had risen from its special meeting with Islamic scholars in the state to declare that there would not be Eid-el-Fitri congregational prayers in Kaduna, as part of measures to avert community transmission of the virus.
