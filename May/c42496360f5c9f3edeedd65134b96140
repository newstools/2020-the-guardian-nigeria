• Implements strategic initiatives to boost power supply
The Lagos State Government said it is more determined now than ever to run the economy through technologies, while also implementing strategic initiatives towards improving electricity supply. The state said it has reinvigorated its e-governance operations, with the innovation of the LASG Campus Network, an enterprise infrastructure that connects thousands of computers from all MDAs within and around the secretariat. The Commissioner for Science and Technology, Hakeem Fahm, who disclosed this yesterday, in Lagos, at the 2020 Ministerial Press Briefing, commemorating the One Year in Office of the Sanwo-Olu-led administration, added that the state is fully committed to leading in ICT for greater good of Lagos and Nigeria as a whole. Fahm disclosed that the upgrade optimises the current network to reliably and securely support new and existing applications and devices. He said the main objective of the optimisation is to increase network availability, performance and security of the LASG Campus Enterprise Network, while also stabilising its ICT environment for a smarter Lagos. Similarly, the State Commissioner for Energy and Mineral Resources, Olalere Odusote, said his Ministry is working with a power focal programme to develop an integrated resource plan for Lagos, to provide a guideline to attract investment in the energy sector in order to tackle the shortage of electricity supply with the benefit for the entire nation. He pointed out that the conceived accelerated power programme aimed at facilitating electricity distribution to under-served and unserved communities in the State, will be implemented in phases with the first phase focusing on low-income communities. He also announced plans to leverage local capacity and talents to provide affordable smart metering, by seeking innovative metering solutions and currently facilitating a drive for local production of affordable smart meters to improve electricity supply in the State. He added that in achieving its agenda of making Lagos a 21st century economy, his Ministry has further developed an implementation strategy along primary initiatives of the State, which include, the accelerated light up programme, electrification of public infrastructure, clean energy initiatives, local capacity building, and oil and gas interventions. He said under the accelerated light up programme, the objective is to unlock distribution and transmission infrastructure constraints to deliver reliable power supply high population and low income communities across the State. He added that the Ministry is working with Electricity Distribution Companies in the State as well as private developers for the procurement and installation of 20,000 metres for communities in Lagos, adding has also concluded an electricity franchising agreement with both Ikeja and Eko DisCos. The Ministry is also in different stages of signing collaboration agreements with smart metering companies to supply meters to targeted low-income communities in Lagos. “We have also launched a smart meter design programme to increase meter penetration in the State, by leveraging local capacity towards improving electricity distribution and monitoring, noting that the ministry has also identified the distribution challenges in Lagos and commenced engagement with TCN for prioritizing the requisite upgrades that are needed.” Meanwhile, Fahm further disclosed that the improved online solution, innovated the first ever virtual meeting, held by the State Executive Council, in the history of governance in Nigeria. Speaking on the role of Digital Technology in driving Lagos Economy, he informed that the LASG Enterprise GIS Upgrade, and Integrated Land Administration Automation Programme, will provide a fully-digital mapping platform, and an integrated end-to-end land administration system. This will effectively reduce silos of information system and developing programmes such as security, aerial surveillances, search and rescue operations, health, mapping flood and erosion control and many more.
