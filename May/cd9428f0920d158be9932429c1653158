• IATA Wants FG To Implement Specific Financial Relief Measures For Aviation Sector About two months of local and international flights restriction has cost the local travel sector massive job and financial losses in excess of N180b. In fact, the cost may be more going by the International Air Transport Association’s (IATA) estimates, which showed that the prolonged lockdown and the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) crisis put 124,000 Nigerian jobs at risk, and some $900m (N324b) of the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in jeopardy.
 
It would be recalled that the Federal Government in March placed a restriction on both local and international flights as part of efforts to contain the spread of the pandemic. The restriction, however, excluded cargo, emergency and essential flights as approved by the Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika. The government, last Wednesday, extended the flight restriction by another four weeks.
 
According to the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Finchglow Travels, Bernard Bankole, losses from passenger traffic revenue is in excess of N180b because the crisis may just last till July.  Prior to the crisis, aviation contributed $1.7b to Nigeria’s GDP and supported 241,000 jobs, IATA stated. IATA’s Regional Vice President for Africa and the Middle East, Muhammad Albakri, acknowledged that the Nigerian government had introduced broad economic relief packages to mitigate the devastation caused by COVID-19, but the body is now urging the government to implement specific financial relief measures for aviation in order for the sector to be capable of driving the recovery.  “As the aviation industry looks to restart, it is important that key regional players like Nigeria are ready and able. Aviation is a strategic pillar for social and economic development. Supporting aviation now will mean that Nigeria’s economy can pick up from where it stopped and drive forward,” Albakri said.
