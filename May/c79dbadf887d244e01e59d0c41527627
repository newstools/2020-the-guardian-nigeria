John Boyega Image Vibe John Boyega blasts Sky News over an article on their website subtly comparing a traditional African hairstyle to coronavirus especially with their headline. On Saturday morning, the Star Wars actor took issue with the news outlet over a piece published by them on Monday, with the headline: “Spiky coronavirus haircut growing in popularity in Africa, here’s why.” The article in question refers to a technique that uses threaded yarn to style hair, claiming it has had a resurgence in popularity in Kenya due to “financial struggles linked to the coronavirus restrictions, along with raising awareness that Covid-19 is real” John Boyega was not having the headline as he asked if they had lost their minds.  He further advised that “The media need to make sure they do research before wiring articles like this.” When another tweeter user further asked if everyone read the article itself, John replied: “The problem is the headline.” The Sky News article in question features a quote from a mother in Kenya, who told the news outlet that she chose the hairstyle for her daughter because “money is scarce” as a result of the pandemic, saying: “The hairstyle also helps in communicating with the public about the virus.” Other celebrities also commented on the headline and the article itself, asking that it should be reworked. Sky News, however, still has the article on their site.
