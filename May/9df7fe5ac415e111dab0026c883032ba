She alleged that Okoye has taken over her Instagram and VEVO accounts and has also stopped her from using the stage name Cynthia Morgan. “I went through a lot as Cynthia Morgan that a lot of people didn’t know about,” she told Upfront With Sandra. Morgan said that Jude Okoye didn’t promote her but was only shooting videos. She said that Okoye claims she is owing him the money spent on shooting the music videos. Peter Okoye (Mr P) In a series of tweets, Peter Okoye also chipped in on the controversy between Morgan and Jude Okoye. “And some people thought i was stupid when I made the right decision. My dear C Morgan! it’s never to late to be what you might have been. God will surely see you through and carry you through the storm. Keep believing” Mr P revealed that his decision to split from the group was never about money but freedom. “My dear C Morgan, The decision i made 3yrs ago was never about the firm,money or power! It was for my FREEDOM! Sad you rejected the contract i gave u. Just because they made you see me like the bad egg. I pray you understand that God has a purpose for everything. Never give up “The Truth shall prevail. God will surely see you through C Morgan”. Following his own exit from PSquare and Northside Records, Peter offered Cynthia Morgan a chance to join his own label, but she rejected it. “Peter is an artiste. I would never sign with an artiste, especially Nigerian artistes,” she said in an interview with the Net. “Jude is always not the nice guy but I preferred to go with Jude. Because I felt like he understood the business more.” She said she chose to stay with Jude although it was a tough decision as Peter offered her incentives like a car and a house none of which she got from Jude. Upfront With Sandra is marshalling the movement to bring Cynthia Morgan back. She stated on her Instagram page that she has set up a GoFundMe account to help finance the singer’s return to the industry. “We have decided to set up this gofundme to appeal to her fans to please contribute in bringing her back on the scene”, Sandra wrote on Saturday. “She has unreleased fire hits that we can’t wait to share with the world. The truth is, she has remained the undisputed queen of dance hall in Nigeria and we need her back”.
