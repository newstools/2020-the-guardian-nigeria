Nigeria Football Federation President, Amaju Pinnick has disclosed that the federation appointed Joseph Yobo as assistant coach of the Eagles to prepare for a future role of the team’s manager. Pinnick noted at the weekend that the leadership role displayed by Yobo when he was the captain of the Eagles motivated the NFF to appoint him as a member of the team’s technical crew. He maintained that Yobo’s appointment would contribute to the development of the Eagles, as the team look ahead to qualify for the 2021 African Cup of Nations and the 2022 World Cup. “When Yobo was captain of the Super Eagles before he retired, I saw inborn leadership character in him. His charisma and the way he carried other players in the team was exceptional. “Yobo is a born leader. This is why the federation decided to appoint him as one of the assistants in Super Eagles team. “We are looking up to Yobo to manage the Super Eagles in future and being part of the team’s technical crew will give him that opportunity to coach the Super Eagles in the nearest future. “The Late Stephen Keshi was also an exceptional leader when he was the captain of the Super Eagles. He later grew in the coaching job to handle the Super Eagles. Yobo needs to be encouraged. “This is not the first time a Nigerian retired player would be given this type of opportunity. Yobo’s presence in the Eagles will help the team,” he said. On Yobo’s lack of the required certificate for the job, Pinnick clarified that “apart from the first assistant in the national team, other coaches that are yet to get coaching licence are allowed to be in the team’s technical set up according to the rules. So, Yobo’s appointment is on track.” The president also revealed that the federation was working round the clock to raise funds for the Super Eagles’ campaign to qualify for the AFCON and World Cup when hostilities resume after the COVID-19 lockdown.
