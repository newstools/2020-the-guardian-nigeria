Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari has lost his nephew, Mutari Dauda. Garba Shehu, a presidential spokesman, in a statement on Friday described Dauda’s death as an “irreparable loss”. The presidential spokesman however did not state the cause of Dauda’s death. Mutari Dauda is Malam Mamman Daura’s younger brother. “Let me on behalf of myself and my family convey to you my deepest sympathy for the loss of Mutari Dauda. Death is inevitable and every soul must taste death one day,” Garba said in the statement on behalf of Buhari. “What we owe the dead are not tears, because our tears can’t bring them back, but what they deserve are our prayers. In this regard, my heart and prayers go out to all the family members and the Daura community as a whole over this irreparable loss. “May Allah forgive his gentle soul and reward his goods deeds with aljanna. Amin,” prayed Buhari.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
