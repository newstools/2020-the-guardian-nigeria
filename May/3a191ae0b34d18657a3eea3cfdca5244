The Court of Appeal sitting in Owerri yesterday upheld the processes that led to the victory of Bayelsa State Governor, Douye Diri. The court also dismissed Ndutimi Alaibe’s claim that the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) adopted a “flawed process” during the primary that led to the emergence of Diri as the standard-bearer of the party in the 2019 governorship election in the state, declaring the suit for lack of merit. Alaibe, who had aspired alongside with the governor, was dissatisfied, and challenged the matter at the Federal High Court sitting in Owerri, Imo State capital, presided over by Justice Tijjani Ringim. The court dismissed it on March 10, 2020. Also not satisfied, Alaibe proceeded to the Court of Appeal to challenge it, but upholding the lower court’s ruling, the Court of Appeal ruled that Diri’s victory process was legitimate. The All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate, David Lyon, who had been declared winner by the INEC, but following the Supreme Court’s ruling that Lyon’s deputy, Biobarakuma Degi Eremienyo, forged his credentials with multiple names to the INEC; his victory was voided because it was a joint ticket. The development took place less than 24 hours to Lyon’s hitherto billed inauguration. He was also openly rehearsing on that eve before the news was broken to him.Subsequently, Diri was declared winner and sworn in same day with his deputy.
