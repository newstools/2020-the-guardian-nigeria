Specifically, Oilserv Group of Companies, stated that while the group channels large numbers of personal protective equipment (PPE), sophisticated devices for rapid medical tests, and other medical supplies to the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19, it is also supplying communities across the country with tons of foodstuff to help families cope with the pains of city lockdowns imposed by the government to break the chain of infection. The company under the sponsorship of Sir Emeka Okwuosa Foundation has already delivered over 3500 bags of rice and 8000 yam tubers to a number of communities in Rivers, Abia and Anambra States as it tours selected communities across the country with food palliatives for families impacted by the economic shutdown associated with coronavirus. The Oilserv Group and Sir Emeka Okwuosa Foundation declared that it became necessary to rise in support of the government and the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) in the collective effort to contain the spread of the disease and also palliate the impact on Nigerians. The intervention package from Oilserv Group valued at over N100 million would be the biggest single donation by any indigenous oil service company in the coronavirus fight. The company had already featured prominently in the collective contribution by the Petroleum Technology Association of Nigeria (PETAN) under the guidance of the Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB). Director of the Sir Emeka Okwuosa Foundation, Hon. Azuka Okwuosa, said the group believes in the power of humanity to solve any challenge, adding that the belief is deeply rooted in a commitment to impact lives positively and to support the government at this difficult time. He pointed out that the new coronavirus disease has delivered devastating impact around the world, disrupting lives and livelihoods. While the sophisticated medical supplies would be donated to the federal government through the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) which coordinates industry response to the pandemic challenge, the Group has already started distribution of the food supplies to communities through Sir Emeka Okwuosa Foundation. The medical supplies worth over N70 million ordered for NNPC include 6000 disposable snout masks, 1500 hand gloves, 80 cartons of face shields and 4000 disposable protective suits. The digital medical tools include 1200 infrared thermometers, 250 facial and temperature monitors, and 2500 COVID 19 rapid test kits with capacity for 15 minutes result.
