Although  members of the Batch B, Stream II of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), are looking forward to their passing out, there is growing fear of getting a job as COVID-19 pandemic is ravaging the economic landscape. They expressed concern, especially with the novel COVID-19 pandemic ravaging the world, when many companies are downsizing, cutting salaries and even unable to pay workers for months due to low financial inflow.
 
The announcement spurred mixed reactions among passing out Corps members, who seemed not to be ready due to uncertainties and the economic uncertainty facing Nigeria at this time.
 
For instance, a Corps member, Olushola told The Guardian that she is not ready to pass out as she does not know where to go.She said: “I am a serving Corps member in one of the private schools in Lagos. I had hope of being retained until my hope was dashed because of the infectious virus that led to the present lockdown.”  He said: “If schools could be closed including government and private businesses because of the pandemic, I wonder why the passing out parade can also not be put on hold until the coast is clearer.
 
“What they want to avoid is the continued payment of allowances to the concerned Corps members instead of the benefits not just to the Corps members but also to our economy.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
