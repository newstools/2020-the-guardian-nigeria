Rauf Olaniyan yesterday led the state delegation on a condolence visit to the family of Kehinde Ayoola, the State Commissioner for Environment and Natural Resources, who died on Thursday morning. While condoling the wife of the deceased, Prof. Olukemi Ayoola, Olaniyan described the demise of Ayoola as unexpected and a great loss of an active player in the Makinde administration. This was as the state government suspended the executive members of Bodija International Market for their alleged involvement in illegal collection of fees from traders. The Deputy Governor said the late Ayoola was not a dormant member of the state executive but a resourceful and active contributor to the state executive meetings. He consoled the wife, children and the entire family of the deceased to accept the heartfelt sympathy of the state cabinet and the people of Oyo state. Secretary to the State Government, Mrs. Olubanwo Adeosun; Head of Service, Mrs. Amidat Agboola; and the Chief Press Secretary to Governor Seyi Makinde, were part of the delegation team. Announcing the suspension of exco of Bodija Market, Caretaker Chairman, Aare Latosa local council development area (LCDA), Ibadan North, Samonda, Prince Adewale Osoniyi, said the government was moved by the series of complaints on the illegal collections. He insisted that an arrangement was just concluded to begin the collection of annual revenue from traders by July. He stated that the preliminary investigation and arrest of the perpetrators made so far indicated the involvement of the executive members of the traders association. Osoniyi assured that the vacuum created by the suspension of the executives would not cause any rancor, adding that the essence was to allow the government do a thorough investigation into those involved and who was getting the money. “The mode of payment that people know is what we are still using. Traders only pay into government bank account and show teller to government task force. We are starting the revenue drive from the first week of July with the collection of ground rent and we have not sent anybody to go and collect any money on our behalf yet,” he added.
