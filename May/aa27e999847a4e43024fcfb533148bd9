Clubs returned to socially distanced training in small groups this week and the league hope to begin playing the remaining 92 matches on June 12 or 19. Amongst the six who had already tested positive were Watford defender Adrian Mariappa as well as two members of the club’s staff. Watford manager Nigel Pearson also revealed two more of his squad are in self-isolation after members of their family tested positive for the virus.
