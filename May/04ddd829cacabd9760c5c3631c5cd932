Traditional ruler of Umuajameze autonomous community in Umuahia South LGA Abia state, Eze Godfrey Ibeakanma has stated that Coronavirus-19 has strengthened the unity and love in his community. He disclosed this yesterday during the distribution of palliative items procured by the people of the community comprising bags of rice and beans, drums of kerosene and noodles, which the people of the community tasked themselves to procure for distribution to their less privileged neighbours including poor non-indigenes resident in the community, describing the gesture as pure love. He urged the state government to use this period to know the different communities, appoint qualified persons into public service positions, address their ecological and other inadequacies as well as extend palliatives to them. The royal father who lauded sons and daughters that contributed to the project, frowned at the wealthy ones that were yet to do so, adding that God would reward everyoneâ€™s good deeds.
