• Agency Appeals For Land To Build Office Delta State Governor, Senator Ifeanyi Okowa, has urged the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) to apply tougher measures in tackling adulteration of goods and drugs in the country. Meanwhile, the agency has appealed for land to build its office. The governor, represented by his deputy, Mr. Kingsley Otuaro, made the call on Friday in Asaba, when the Director-General of NAFDAC, Prof. Mojisola Adeyeye visited him. Okowa said the agency was doing well in the discharge of its mandate, but there was a need for improvement, as adulteration of drugs had not abated. He said: “We express appreciation to the management of the agency for establishing an investigative centre in Asaba. It will check the prevalence of fake goods and medications in Delta. The centre will give so much value to us as a state, because over 50 per cent of products, including alcoholic beverages that come into our state through our eastern neighbours, are adulterated…” Adeyeye thanked Okowa for his administration’s support, adding that she and her team were in the state to launch the Investigative and Enforcement Office of the agency, and to seek further ways of partnering the government.
