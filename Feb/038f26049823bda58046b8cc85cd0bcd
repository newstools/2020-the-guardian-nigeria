A contestant to the vacant stool of Oba of Iwoye town via Ilaro has been arrested for forging a WAEC certificate. The suspect, Alhaji Fagbemi Waheed, was arrested by the police following a petition received from the chamber of one R.R.A & Associate in which he was accused of forging a WAEC certificate number NGSG 809573, which he claimed to have obtained in 1988.
   
The petitioner further stated that the suspect forged the said certificate for the purpose of using it to contest for the throne of Oluwoye of Iwoye town. On the strength of the petition, the officer in-charge, Anti-kidnapping Section of the Ogun State police command was detailed to investigate the case, consequent upon which the suspect was arrested and search warrant was executed in his house where the forged certificate was recovered. A statement made available by the police public relations officer of Ogun command, Abimbola Oyeyemi, said that the WAEC certificate bearing the above number actually belonged to one Riamot Omotola Adebayo.
   
On interrogation, the suspect confessed that he collected the certificate from the owner on the pretence that he wanted to use it to secure a job for her but took it to a cybercafe where he super imposed his own name on it and printed it out as original. He stated further that he did so because he wanted to contest for the Obaship position of his town.
