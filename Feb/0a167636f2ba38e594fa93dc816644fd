Steve Ballmer and head coach Doc Rivers gladly agreed because there is solidarity and love for Kobe and his family. and the significance of the 2/24 date was not lost on them. Also, When Michael Jackson and Nipsey Hussle’s memorials were held there, all the surrounding streets were shut down to anyone who didn’t have a ticket.
