The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Makurdi Zonal Office yesterday secured the conviction of one Otene Olafikwu for offence bordering on currency counterfeiting. He was on February 6, brought before Justice Mobolaji Olajuwon of a Federal High Court sitting in Makurdi, Benue State on a two-count charge alongside John Garba Aondohemba, Simon Atsen Gbagir and Janet Tyondugh for possessing and altering two counterfeit $50 bills.  In view of his guilty plea, and subsequent review of the facts of the case, the prosecuting counsel, Y.Y. Tarfa, prayed the court to convict him accordingly. Counsel to Olafikwu, I. M. Mari, however, pleaded with the court to temper justice with mercy, saying his client was a first-time offender. Consequently, Justice Olajuwon convicted and sentenced him to two years in prison, with an option of fine of N100,000.
