About 13 years after the facility was bought and abandoned, the Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NIMET) has concluded plans to install and put the N2.7 billion worth of Doppler weather radar system to use.
 
The fresh optimism is not unconnected with the missing link – a component – that has just been acquired in readiness for the final stages of the installation.
 
The radar system, The Guardian learnt, will enhance nationwide weather coverage and predictions, with attendant effects on airspace safety.  The contract for the Doppler weather radar was awarded in 2007 by the Federal Executive Council (FEC).
 
The Director-General of NIMET, Prof. Sani Mashi, recently told reporters in Lagos that the project was awarded for N2.7 billion, with an additional component and installation cost of another N100 million. The later cost was not paid and has stalled the project since then.  He was optimistic that the weather radar coverage would have achieved at least 80 per cent airspace coverage by June, leveraging on other equipment earlier installed in Port Harcourt and Abuja. “You know Doppler radar system is an instrument that measure characteristics of precipitation. Precipitation, storm intensity, storm direction, and other things, can affect flight and operations, which means that with us now in a position to measure so much characteristics of precipitation, we will now be in a position to have adequate information that will help us to ensure that planning operations are made quite safe, and sustainable within the country. That is a major breakthrough,” he said.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
