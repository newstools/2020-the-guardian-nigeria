The Supreme Court on Wednesday dismissed an application by the All Progressives Congress (APC) and David Lyon for the review of the verdict on the Bayelsa State governorship election. The apex court on Thursday, February 13, 2020, sacked APC’s Lyon and his deputy-elect Biobarakuma Degi-Eremienyo. The court sacked Lyon for contesting the election on a joint ticket with Degi-Eremienyo, whom it said presented an invalid certificate to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). Federal High Court in Abuja had earlier disqualified Degi-Eremienyo from the election for the same reason. Degi-Eremienyo, however, challenged the high court verdict that restrained him from participating in the election the APC won. A three-man panel of the appeal court chaired by Justice Stephen Adah ruled that the high court erred in law and in breach of the appellant’s right to a fair hearing and reversed the judgement for Degi-Eremienyo to contest the election. However, a five-man panel of the Supreme Court led by Justice Mary Peter-Odili said the former deputy governor-elect’s academic credentials were invalid and ordered INEC to withdraw the certificate of return issued to Lyon. The court ordered INEC to issue a certificate of return to the Peoples Democratic Party’s candidate Senator Douye Diri who came second in the election. Diri has since been sworn-in as Bayelsa State governor, succeeding former governor Seriake Dickson.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
