Former Imo State Governor, Emeka Ihedioha has accused the State Governor, Sen. Hope Uzodinma of feeding Nigerians with lies on the true state of affairs in the state. In a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Chibuike Onyeukwu, Ihedioha said Uzodinma has resorted to making claims that are false, unfounded and misleading. He said most of the projects the governor claimed he has achieved and are taking credit for, are all signatures of his achievements he made as a governor in the state. “We wish to inform the general public that all the claims made by the Senator, concerning the Supreme Court judgment, the matters arising from it, restoration of pipe borne water and electricity, as well as payment of all outstanding salaries owed Imo workers are blatant lies and deliberate distortion of facts, aimed at currying legitimacy.” “Firstly, we bear no grudge on his statement that the Supreme Court cannot review its January 14, 2020 judgment. That is the extent he knows to sustain his deception and illegitimate government. Claiming that time for election petition has elapsed was playing to the gallery, he engaged in a failed ambush of the Supreme Court. The Court knows that Ihedioha has a very good case as shown in all the glaring facts of the matter and so, does not require his lame opinion.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
