Inspector General of Police (IGP), Mohammed Adamu, has ordered all Commissioners of Police (CPs) to seize vehicles illegally using Spy number plates, sirens, revolving lights or covered number plates and ensure prosecution of offenders. To this end, all vehicles found to have Spy number plates not duly issued, using sirens or revolving lights without permit or having covered number plates would be impounded. Adamu, who disclosed this when the Corps Marshal, Federal Road Safety Corps, Boboye Oyeyemi, visited him yesterday at the Force Headquarters, Abuja, said the practices were illegal and pose monumental security risks to the country and its citizens.
