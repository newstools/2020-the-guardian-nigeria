Gov. Ayade contradicts self on Jalingo’s travails For over 168 days, the publisher of an online newspaper, CrossRiverWatch, politician, and human rights activist, Comrade Agba Jalingo, has been incarcerated in Calabar. He always comes to court handcuffed and in prisons’ pick up van, dressed in blue jeans and grey-coloured shoes and black t-shirt, with the inscription ‘Dictators perpetually fear our pens’. Armed security agents guard him to ensure no escape for a man whose ‘weapon’ is the pen as the premises of the Federal High Court, Calabar, has a swarm of amour trucks and anti-riot tanks as if Boko Haram has relocated to Calabar. However, what has characterized the trial of Jalingo so far has been the apparent contradiction on the part of Governor Ben Ayade and his government over the exact nature of Jalingo’s offence and trial. While only recently in Abuja Ayade denied his involvement in his trial, his Attorney-General, Tanko Ashang, has admitted that Cross River State was behind Jalingo’s trial for treason. Ashang informed the court that the state government was taking over the prosecution of Jalingo and had informed Justice Simon Amobeda who presides over Court 2 of the Calabar division of the Federal High Court that a letter to that effect had been filed and is in the records of the court. This development has eventually put paid to speculations as to who had been behind Mr. Jalingo’s arrest and incarceration for 169 days running even though the state governor, Ayade, and his aids had severally denied claims from different organisations and individuals that he and the state were behind the journalist’s ordeal.
 
In one of the trials, there were protests by friends, relatives, and colleagues of Jalingo, who the release of Jalingo with placards reading: ‘#Free Jalingo now,’ ‘Dictators perpetually fear our pens,’ ‘Journalism not a crime,’ ‘Free the press,’ ‘Jalingo performed his constitutional duty.’
 
Before now both men who are from the same Obudu Local Government Area were like 5-&-6, but their relationship later went awry and Governor of Cross River State, Ben Ayade, soon developed zero tolerance for Jalingo’s criticisms. Some of the critical issues Jalingo alleged in his write-ups against Ayade include an article demanding that the government should explain the whereabouts of the N500 million approved and released for the floating of the wobbling Cross River Microfinance Bank. Jalingo, who is a member of the opposition African Acton Congress (AAC), also asked the state government to explain how N14.5 billion said to be in government’s coffers was spent within three months last year and wondered why such huge sum of money would come to the state while the governor would still borrow money. Other issues Jalingo raised against Ayade were the proposed Obudu Cargo and Passenger Airport and Ayade’s diesel-driven power project, which he described as “a hoax”.
 
These issues might have incensed Ayade to move against Jalingo as he (Ayade) was quoted to have said in a reference to Jalingo before his arrest while delivering an address at the opening of the Green Carnival event on July 30, 2019, “In Cross River, a man who is begging and does not get what he wants becomes a journalist and starts blackmailing the state. That is not journalism. Unfortunately, the period of blackmail is over. The period of writing nonsense and earning a living is over, because no matter what you write, you don’t change the truth.”
 
Not too long after this statement, the Police Command in Cross River State, in a letter dated August 14, 2019 titled “Conspiracy To Cause Breach of Public Peace” and signed by Mrs. Tami Peterside, a Deputy Commissioner of Police in charge of the State Criminal Investigation Department, invited Jalingo to report to her office on August 19, 2019 at 2:00pm for an interview in respect of a publication concerning Cross River Micro Finance Bank in July.  He is in court for treason. A state does not have the power to try anyone for treason; it is not me as his arrest and trial are in connection with Omoyele Sowore’s #RevolutionNow protest.”Ayade also accused Jalingo of being a blackmailer, saying Jalingo also previously falsely accused a former governor of the state and his wife of child trafficking.
 
But a former governorship candidate of Peoples Progressive Alliance (PPA), Mr. Goddie Akpama, has faulted Ayade’s claims saying, “I think I have come to the conclusion that the detention of Jalingo is based on your prompting, and not from the Federal Government, as you want the world to believe based on what you said recently when you visited Aso Rock. You claimed the police are Federal Government institution, hence Jalingo is being tried by the Federal Government. Having said that, you should have stopped at that if you were not directly responsible!
 
“It is because you are directly responsible; that is why you went further to tell the world your grievances with him, and how he has been a blackmailer, a politician, a businessman and so on… Don’t forget that the initial charge sheet in court contains allegations relating to the said N500m publication, and allegation that Agba Jalingo wanted to overthrow your government”.  Human rights group, Amnesty International has said the Federal Government and Cross River State Government were manipulating the Nigerian criminal justice system to repress dissenting voices in violation of the 1999 constitution as amended as well as international and regional human rights treaties and protocols.
 
Media Manager of Amnesty International, Mr. Sanusi Isa, in a press conference on Thursday in Calabar, said, “While Agba Jalingo is detained for his critical opinions, both Cross River and the Federal Government are collaborating, through the manipulation of the criminal justice system to keep him behind bars… Jalingo’s trial falls short of international standards of fairness, especially because the court has allowed witnesses to be masked and the trial to be held in secret.“Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River State and the government of President Muhammadu Buhari must stop filing bogus and politically motivated charges against critics and start listening to what they have to say”.
