Caroline Flack | Image: Deadline Former host of U.K.’s Love Island Caroline Flack has died. Her death was confirmed by her family in a statement via the Press Association on Saturday. She was 40. “We can confirm that our Caroline passed away today on the 15th February,” the statement began. “We would ask that the press both respect the privacy of the family at this difficult time.” While no cause of death was given, Flack was found unresponsive at her apartment in London and is believed to have killed herself. This is coming just weeks before she was due to go on trial for assaulting her boyfriend, tennis player Lewis Burton, who in December accused her of hitting him with a lamp before he later backtracked on these claims. Flack began her career in the comedy series Bo’ Selecta! in 2002 and went on to present shows on the ITV network such as The Xtra Factor. She began presenting the dating reality series Love Island in 2015, which she became well known for. The reality series follows a group of young men and women living in a Spanish villa together and hoping to find romantic connections. She began hosting “Love Island” in 2015 and its spinoff show “Love Island: Aftersun” in 2017. She stepped down from the hosting gig in late 2019 following allegations of an assault toward Burton. She was replaced by Laura Whitmore. Flack was born in 1979 in London. Among her additional TV credits, she had guest appearances in Celebrity Juice, Britain’s Got More Talent, Loose Women, Sunday Brunch and Strictly Come Dancing among others.
