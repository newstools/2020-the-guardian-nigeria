Despite the economic and political challenges of year 2019, passenger traffic demand recorded slow but steady growth across regions.
 
The International Air Transport Association’s (IATA) full-year passenger traffic results, released recently, showed that demand rose by 4.2 per cent compared to the full year of 2018. 
 
African airlines led all regions with a 5.0 per cent demand increase, though down from 6.3 per cent growth recorded for 2018.  Our thoughts are also with the injured, and the families of those who lost their lives, in the PC2193 accident in Turkey yesterday. Safety is the aviation industry’s number one priority and we are united in our desire to understand and learn from the circumstances of this tragedy.   
 
“Today, headlines are also focused on the novel coronavirus. From our experience of past outbreaks, airlines have well-developed standards and best practices to keep travel safe. And airlines are assisting the World Health Organisation (WHO) and public health authorities in efforts to contain the outbreak in line with the International Health Regulations.
 
“There currently is no advice from WHO to restrict travel or trade. But it is clear that demand has fallen on routes associated with China, and airlines are responding to this by cutting capacity for both domestic and international China. The situation is evolving fast, but we are observing significant schedules adjustments for February,” de Juniac said.
