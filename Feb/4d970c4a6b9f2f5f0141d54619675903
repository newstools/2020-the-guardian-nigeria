We are monitoring the situation and we want to assure the athletes that the All Comers in Akure has been designed to meet their requirement.” Another AFN official said yesterday that the All Comers in Akure would be filled with fun. “We have secured the venue and will provide accommodation for athletes based on last year’s performance.
