The South West Caucus of the All Progressives Congress (APC) on Friday denied reports that it has endorsed the former governor of Oyo state Abiola Ajimobi as the party’s deputy national chairman. “The attention of the leadership of the South West Caucus of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has been drawn to a misleading report published by Nigeria Tribune of Friday 7,2020, that the Southwest Caucus of the party has approved the appointment of Senator Abiola Ajimobi as the Deputy National Chairman of APC at the Osogbo Meeting of the party’s leadership,” APC Southwest zonal publicity secretary, Karounwi Oladapo, said in a statement. Oladapo said nothing like that happened in the said meeting. Oladapo further stated that as the Zonal Publicity Secretary, statutorily responsible for the dissemination of news and information from the Zonal Caucus, he did not issue any statement after the Osogbo meeting because he was not authorised to do so. He said he didn’t know where the media house, Nigerian Tribune obtained, its information that the party endorsed Ajimobi as the deputy national secretary. “How can the leadership Caucus in Abuja ratify a non-existent endorsement and approval as claimed by the Tribune publication,” Oladapo said. “Where then did Tribune obtain his information? We expect Tribune to take seriously any matter that can put its integrity into question.” Oladapo also reiterated the Statement of the National Vice Chairman South West and the Chairman of the Southwest Zonal Caucus, Bankole Oluwajana, that the Party never approved nor endorsed any candidate at its Osogbo meeting and that the APC National leadership will resolve who among the duo of Senator Gbenga Aluko and Senator Abiola Ajimobi will occupy the vacant seat at the appropriate time.
