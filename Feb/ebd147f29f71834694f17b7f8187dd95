A batch C Corper, Chioma, who earlier expresses her joy on the increment, said the new tax rate has made the money look like the previous amount, adding that it has dashed their hopes of savings before passing out. “I’m very happy the Federal Government kept to their promise; the money will go a long way. But the new tax has compromised everything. In a scenario, where you pay tax on every single transaction from phone calls to data, bank transactions, then you would find out that there’s nothing left,” she lamented. Shantel, another Corps member, who corroborated Chioma’s position, said it’s high time government regulated the issue of tax by introducing a policy that would put the economy of the country into consideration. On his part, Benson, who is serving in Ogun State, urged the government to pull the resources together and create more jobs for corps member to fall back on after their service year. Benson argued that, with the new VAT rate and high cost of transportation in Lagos sate, following the ban of Keke and Okada, the new minimum age is equivalent to the previous N19, 800 and adds no value. “The new minimum wage should have come in employment form; the government already knows quite a number of youths are unemployed and ex-corps members make up this number. Why share the ‘peanuts’ when you can pull the resources together and create something that would benefit this generation and the next,” he quizzed.
