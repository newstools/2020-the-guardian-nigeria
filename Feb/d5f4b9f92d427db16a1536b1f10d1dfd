Nigerian youths in Lagos have urged collaboration among businesses, describing it as a panacea for effective growth. Under the auspices of the Young African Leaders Initiative (YALI), the youths stated this at the weekend during a workshop held in Yaba, Lagos, to discuss the potentials for business growth amid pressured economic constraints in Nigeria. The workshop, tagged “Collaboration for progress”, was put together with a view to helping young Nigerians take their space in the business sector through collaboration. President of the Total Nigeria Co-operative, Mr. Wale Olasoji, who was the guest speaker, said the rise of many businesses through innovation and technological advancement had created tougher operating environment for businesses, making growth only possible for entrepreneurs with a sterling understanding of effective collaboration. Olasoji, who stressed the need for acquisition of basic skills for sustainable business development, advised entrepreneurs to collaborate with people at all levels based on what they can offer but warned against setting up business with people who will have little or no impact.
