Iyana Ipaja on Wednesday morning was on lockdown following a clash between motorcyclists and officers of the Nigeria Police. The clash, our correspondent gathered, occurred when the police officers were enforcing the ban on motorcyclists by the Lagos State Government. Commercial activities were also suspended in the area. Eyewitnesses said buses have been destroyed while stones were thrown at the policemen. The incident is the second in the week after a similar clash at Ijora area of Lagos in reaction to the ban on Okada and tricycles known as Keke in some parts of Lagos.
