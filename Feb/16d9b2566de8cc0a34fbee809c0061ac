Former world light welterweight boxing title contender, Obisia Nwankpa says boxing in the heavyweight division is fast losing its ‘real technicalities’ compared to the eras of Mohammed Alli and Mike Tyson. “The real technicalities in boxing we used to see and enjoy in the 1970s and 80s is no more in the game, and this is worrisome to me,” Obisia told The Guardian yesterday. Obisia Nwankpa, one-time Nigeria’s most prized boxing asset, stated yesterday that the ‘flying punches’ that used to dominate heavyweight boxing in the good old days have suddenly disappeared. As a professional boxer, Obisia reigned at various times as national, continental and Commonwealth champion in the light welterweight category. The high point of his boxing career was in December 13, 1981, when he had a shot at the world title held by Saoul Mamby of the United States of America, but lost by 2-1 split decision. “I watched the re-match between Tyson Fury and Deontay Wilder at the weekend and I did not see the real technicalities in their punches. Tyson Fury won, but as a boxer who fought up to the world level, I did not see the true make of a boxer in that fight. I am sure many people won’t agree with me because they did not see it from the same angle I see heavyweight boxing these days. There may be some powers controlling heavyweight boxing now. It is no longer being controlled by man,” Obisia stated. Tyson Fury did it in grand fashion against Wilder in the early hours of Sunday, as he knocked the American down twice and dominated him en route to a corner stoppage in the seventh round. Fury, who gained the WBC and vacant The Ring heavyweight title, improved to 30-0-1, while Wilder fell to 42-1-1 with the loss.
