Another caller said her daughter and her daughter’s colleagues had been chasing the animals. “My daughter is an occupational therapist at RPA and she said ‘yes mum, I’ve just helped wrangle them’,” the caller said. New South Wales police confirmed on Tuesday evening that they had recaptured three animals just over an hour after reports first emerged. “Just after 5.30pm officers from inner west police area command were called to a car park on Missenden Road and Lucas Street, Camperdown, after reports three baboons escaped while being transported,” a NSW police spokesperson said. “They are currently contained and police are working with experts to safely return them to their facility. “There is no immediate danger to the public but people are advised to avoid the area,” she said. The state’s health minister Brad Hazzard told AAP there was a lock failure either on the truck or crate that was transporting a 15-year-old male and two females. “The three baboons decided to take a bit of a look around RPA grounds,” he said. “They didn’t know what to do nor did the people around them.” “He was having a vasectomy because there’s no desire for him to continue to breed for the troop, and the other option was to move him from the troop. “This way, he can stay with his family through until old age.” Hazzard said.
