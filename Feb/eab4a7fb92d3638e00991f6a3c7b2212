Edo athletes begin mini fiesta in 38 events
Defending champion of the National Sports Festival, Team Delta, will hit camp next week to commence intensive training for the 20th edition of the fiesta tagged Edo 2020. Since the return to democracy in 1999, Team Delta has dominated the NSF, winning six times in eight appearances. Chairman, Delta Sports Commission, Tony Okowa, told The Guardian yesterday that Team Delta would move into camping next week. “We are the defending champions, and so, we have to prepare well for the 2020 edition. Hopefully, we will begin our camping next week,” Okowa stated. Delta won the festival at Bauchi 2000, Abuja 2004, Gateway 2006, KADA 2009, Eko 2012 and the 19th edition, Abuja 2018. The state finished second on two occasions at Edo 2002 and Garden City 2011. In the same way, the Director-General, Delta State Sports Commission, Chris Anazia says Team Delta was doing everything possible to emerge victorious at Edo 2020. Meanwhile, a mini sports festival to select athletes, who will fly Edo State’s flag in the National Sports Festival, will hold from Monday till February 16. A member of the Local Organising Committee (LOC) of Edo 2020 NSF, Ebomhina Musa told The Guardian yesterday that athletes from all the local government areas of Edo State would arrive at the University of Benin campus, Ugbowo, on Sunday. “The competition will begin on Monday in 38 sporting events, and the aim is for Team Edo to pick the best athletes for the 2020 National Sports Festival, which we are hosting. It will be declared open by the governor,” Musa, who is the Secretary of Communication and Publicity sub-committee of Edo 2020 NSF stated. Edo was handed the hosting rights of the 20th NSF by the Ministry of Youth and Sports during the tenure of Solomon Dalung at the grand finale of the 19th edition held in Abuja in 2018. Edo 2020 National Sports Festival is expected to hold between March 20 and April 3. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
