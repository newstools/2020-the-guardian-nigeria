Maglad was treated at a London hospital and returned to the mosque for Friday’s evening service with his arm wrapped in a sling, “I forgive him. I feel very sorry for him,” Maglad told reporters on Friday. “To me, as a Muslim, I don’t need to put any hatred in my heart.” Several regulars at the Regent’s Park area mosque in northwest London said they had seen Horton attend a few services in the past year. Horton will appear at Westminster Magistrates’ Court for a preliminary hearing later Saturday.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
