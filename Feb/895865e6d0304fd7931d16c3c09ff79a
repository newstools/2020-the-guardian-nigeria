Nigeria President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday said he is in support of the country’s citizens living in the diaspora to participate in elections. “I have said it severally that I am not against it,” Buhari said in a meeting with Nigerians living in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. “You will need to convince (the) National Assembly to amend the relevant laws to make Diaspora voting a reality.” Buhari is in Ethiopia for the 33rd Ordinary Session of Heads of State and Government of the African Union (AU). The Nigeria president joined leaders from the 55-member countries of the AU to participate in the Summit themed “Silencing the Guns: Creating Conducive Conditions for Africa’s Development.” At the meeting with the Nigerian Community in Ethiopia (NICE), Buhari spoke about his administration’s plans to combat insecurity, the possibility of diaspora voting and other national issues. On the issue of diaspora voting, the President while responding to a request by the leader of NICE, David Omozuafoh, said he was in support of it, but there is a need for legislation to make it a reality. Buhari assured the Nigerians that his administration is fully determined to combat and defeat all acts of criminality, banditry and terrorism in the country. The President appealed to all Nigerians to support and cooperate with security agencies, who he said are ready to defend and preserve the unity of the country. Buhari assured Nigerians, at home and abroad, that their protection would continue to remain a key priority of his administration, as well as fighting corruption and bringing prosperity to Nigerians. “I have directed the relevant ministries to take up these issue with a view to resolving all complaints amicably with the Ethiopian authorities,” Buhari said.
