To empower young girls with life skills to maximise their potential, Hope Inspired Foundation, organised a 5-day girls Boot camp, themed: “Finding your style and being YOU”.
 
The Foundation targets the girl- child, woman and the youths, aimed at raising transformational girls and leaders, who are purposeful and valuable that would influence their generation.
 
They were taught by speakers and trainers in cooking exercises, marital arts, drilling exercises, public speaking, sign languages, genotype and genetics training among others.  She urged them to take care of themselves besides catering for their families and the society, and enjoined girls to discover their purpose, stressing that every girl leader is a home builder, whose purpose is connected to a problem in the nation or community they were born to solve.  According to Uchegbu, these girls would transform to virtuous women, and can be measured by many lives they have impacted positively. She encouraged them to live healthy and develop good habits that will keep them strong and prolong their days. One of the participants, Cherish Ezeh, an undergraduate student of the University of Lagos, disclosed that it was her third time at the Girl Academy, and every time she learnt something new, mind-blowing and outstanding. She outlined some of the skills, such cooking new African foods, martial arts, engaging community service for cerebral palsy children, public speaking among others.
