The Nigerian Customs Service (NCS), Federal Operations Unit (FOU) Zone ‘A’, has intercepted some foreign parboiled rice concealed in gas cylinders and smuggled into the country from the Benin Republic.
 
The Acting Controller of the Nigeria Customs Service, FOU Zone ‘A’ Usman Yahaya, who confirmed the seizure to The Guardian, said the smugglers were intercepted around Gbaji community in Badagry, area of Lagos with rice, vegetable oil, and poultry products conveyed in 12 different motor vehicles and concealed in gas cylinders.
 
He said the contrabands were worth a cumulative duty paid value (DPV) of N40.1 million.  Yahaya said this desperate act of concealing edible items in gas cylinders by daredevil smugglers further endangers the health of Nigerians.
 
He warned that unless the economic saboteurs repent from their unscrupulous activities, they would continue to count their losses.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
