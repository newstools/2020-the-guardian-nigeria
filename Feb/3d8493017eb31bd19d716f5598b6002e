 Enyimba. Photo: TWITTER  Enyimba were second on the log going into yesterday’s match in Abidjan and needed a draw to ensure they maintained that position at the end of the group stage. Morocco’s Hassania Agadir had already won the group, while Algeria’s Paradou was third on five points, meaning that Enyimba had to win or at least get a draw in Abidjan to qualify irrespective of the outcome of the game between Agadir and Paradou yesterday. Prior to the last group game, Enyimba Coach, Fatai Osho said his wards would take the game to their hosts, adding that playing for a draw was out of the question. The lads lived up to their coach’s words as they rammed in five goals to make San Pedro’s two strikes meaningless. Abdulrahman Bashir got the ball rolling for Enyimba as early as the second minute and was quickly followed by Victor Mbaoma a minute later. The hosts got one back four minutes later, but Austine Oladapo restored Enyimba’s two goals advantage on the 25th minute. Irie Roland made it 3-2 in the 44th minute as the first half ended in Enyimba’s favour. The Peoples Elephant did not let go in the second half as Victor Mbaoma got his brace in the 75th, while Stanley Dimgba registered his name on the score sheet in the 85th minute. Enyimba qualified for the quarterfinals at the expense of AC Paradou, who silenced Hassania Agadir 3-0 thanks to Yousri Bouzok’s treble. Enyimba will know their quarterfinals foes on February 5 at the Hilton Pyramids Golf in Cairo, Egypt. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
