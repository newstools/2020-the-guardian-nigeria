The Nigeria Scrabble Federation (NSF) has predicted that the MindGames Premier Scrabble League (MGI) would help improve the quality of the sport in the country. Speaking on the opening day of the MGI League at Lagos Country Club, Ikeja, where over 200 scrabble players from across the country are competing in divisions A and B of the league, NSF President, Suleiman Gora commended the organisers for bringing another dimension to the development of the sport. He described the scrabble league as another avenue for the federation to discover talents and also enhance the competitive spirit of scrabble players in Nigeria, who have over the years dominated the world in scrabble.
He said that for Nigeria to remain number one in scrabble, the players must be exposed to modern rules of the game, describing the MGI League as a well-organised platform for young players to grow and sharpen their skills. “I must commend the youngman, who brought this initiative, Lukman Owolabi for organising the MGI League. “The NSF is in full support of the league. Our goal is to groom players in the technical aspect to help grow the game of scrabble in Nigeria. “As the league enters the second edition this year, you can see that more players have embraced the game. They will be competing for N7 million worth of prizes. “This year, an international championship will be organised by MGI, which shows the league is being recognised outside the country. “As NSF supports the league, we are not relenting in ensuring that we catch them young. That is why NSF was on ground to also support the Winfred Awosika Foundation Scrabble tournament for schools held at the weekend in Lagos. “Remaining the number one nation in scrabble remains our goal, we can’t sustain it without catching them young,” he said.
