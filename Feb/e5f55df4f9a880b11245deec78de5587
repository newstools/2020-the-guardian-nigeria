Jackye and Omashola | Pulse The reality TV show, Big Brother Naija (BBNaija or BBN) is arguably the most popular and most successful reality TV show in Nigeria. Some will argue that BBN’s success is hinged on the rivalry between contestants that usually manifests every year with housemates constantly pitted against one another during and after the show. It has been a number of months since the last edition of BBNaija ended. The 2019 edition of the show saw Mercy Eke emerge winner and since the end of the show, housemates have gone on to other endeavours. One of the top five finalists, Omashola Kola Obruoh fondly called Omashola earlier today took to Twitter to share a post. He wrote: “Sometimes spoil yourself, no be everytime you go they work like Jackie.” Jackye Madu another ex-contestant on the 2019 edition of BBN perceived Omashola’s post to be about her and she fired back with a post of her own. She took to her own Twitter page and wrote: “To be the greatest, you have to keep working, innovating and creating valueable solutions not wasting your time baling. You will end up as a 40 years old man with no wealth. P.S: You haven’t made since you left BBN 5% profit I’ve made this February on a project. #techmoney #noiseless #checkthestats.” Although Jackye did not directly mention Omashola in her post, her reference to a 40-year-old man appears to be a reference to Omashola’s age as it is public knowledge that he was the oldest contestant on the show. As earlier stated, BBN thrives due to the controversies that seemingly surrounds the housemates and this will not be the first and defintely won’t be the last time former housemates will throw subs at each other.
