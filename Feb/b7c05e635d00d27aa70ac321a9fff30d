•As stakeholders seek more participation from informal sector
The Minister of State for Agriculture and Rural Development, Mustapha Shehuri, has said the Ministry in collaboration with the African Development Bank (AfDB), would promote and develop Special Agro-Industrial Processing Zones (SAPZS), in Nigeria.
  
He said this will enable both local and foreign partners to advance the level of trade and investments in the agricultural sector as a veritable strategy to diversify the economy.
  
Shehuri disclosed this yesterday,at the Ecobank Agribusiness Summit, themed: “Unlocking productivity and investment opportunities across Nigeria’s agribusiness value chain,” in Lagos. He stressed the need for viable synergy and collaboration of all the relevant stakeholders, including the financial sector as well as government at all levels and development partners.  He added: “We will leverage on the successful templates generated in the commodities and agribusiness sectors in the economies that we have supported across the continent, so we can replicate the same in Nigeria.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
