It’s like a shark that smells the scent of blood in the water, goes blind and attacks,” he said in an interview. After bouncing back from a calf injury that sidelined him for two months, Alisson, 27, has saved 26 of the last 27 shots he has faced.

We’ve still got a long way to go, but we’re going to keep it up,” said Alisson, who was named the world’s best goalkeeper by FIFA last year and won the inaugural Lev Yachine trophy for a top keeper at the Ballon d’Or awards in December. Liverpool, who also won the FIFA Club World Cup and UEFA Super Cup last year, is aiming to not only win the Premier League for the first time in 30 years this season but smash the record books in the process. Alisson credited manager Jurgen Klopp with getting the best out of the team “thanks to his simplicity.” “He’s straightforward and honest. He believes in his method,” he said. “He’s a very fair guy who treats everyone well.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
