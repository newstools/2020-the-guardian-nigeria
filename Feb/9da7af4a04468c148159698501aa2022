It appears “No mannaz” pioneer and popular controversial Nigerian artiste, Naira Marley has lost his account to hackers who are supposedly in Denmark, as stated in the bio. The verified account which used to be the home of Marley’s ‘deep thoughts’ has been taken over and turned into a private account by a certain “Fros” with a bio that reads: Ortam sanal olsa da işlenen suç gerçektir. When translated via Twitter, it states: Although the environment is virtual, the crime is real. Recall in May 2019 the “Am I A Yahoo Boy” crooner was arrested by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) over allegedly being involved in internet fraud. The agency said the alleged crimes contravened the Money Laundering (Prohibition) Act and the Cyber Crimes Act. After weeks of being in EFCC custody,  he was granted bail on the conditions that he must provide Two Million Naira (N2,000,000) bond and two sureties, one with landed property and the other, a Civil Servant, not lower than a level 10 officer. The hack comes as a sudden shock to Marlians and supporters of the No Mannaz movement as Marley appeared to be someone who wouldn’t fall victim to such malicious acts. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1107760 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/naira-marley-hacked-acct.jpg" alt="" width="603" height="630" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/naira-marley-hacked-acct.jpg 603w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/naira-marley-hacked-acct-572x598.jpg 572w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/naira-marley-hacked-acct-487x509.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/naira-marley-hacked-acct-230x240.jpg 230w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/naira-marley-hacked-acct-459x480.jpg 459w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/naira-marley-hacked-acct-574x600.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 603px) 100vw, 603px" /> Many Nigerians have since taken to twitter to express shock, mockery, among other emotions.
