Chaka Khan | Shutterstock Two years ago, singer Fergie came under heavy criticism from fans for her “poor performance” of the national anthem of the USA, “The Star-Spangled Banner,” before the NBA All-Star Game. However, many are now of the opinion that 10 times Grammy award-winning singer, Chaka Khan‘s performance last night before the NBA All-Star Game will give Fergie’s a run for her money. The soul songstress had taken to the stage to bring a level of extreme melisma to “The Star-Spangled Banner” and many were not feeling it as they believed she was “all over the place.” Fans soon took to Twitter to pour out their backlash on Chaka Khan whom they say had an unbelievable “worst rendition” than Fergie. Chaka Khan’s ‘unique rendition’ had its defenders with at least one celebrity in the person of Magic Johnson defending the star whom he says had an “amazing rendition.” Watch Chaka Khan perform the national anthem below:  Check out reactions below: I’m not watching the all star game but my phone is ringing off the hook.
