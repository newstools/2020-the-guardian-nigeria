T-Classic – Underrated Sequel to the announcement of his signing to Sony Music Entertainment West Africa, budding star T-Classic has now released his first-ever body of work titled “Underrated.” Fresh out and still basking off of a vibe-full experience that was the Detty December rave in Lagos Nigeria, having featured alongside the industry’s biggest names and on some of the most revered stages, T-Classic attacks early in the year 2020 with the release of a statement EP. “Underrated (the EP)” is an oxymoronically titled project with themes expressed in hustle, fame and gratitude. It comprises five (5) tracks and musical features from pop titans, Mayorkun and Peruzzi on the lead single “Where You Dey”. The EP was engineered into perfection by the trio of Iambeatz, Killertunes and Mowizzy; their independent efforts have supported the revealing of a dimension to the singer’s artistic tendency that was yet untapped. Also supporting the EP release, is the documentary visual that chronicles the rising of a star as he journeys into becoming. T-Classic takes us on an emotional narrative of events that led him to this glorious moment. Watch below!  Listen and download T-Classic “Underrated (the EP)” using the links below.
