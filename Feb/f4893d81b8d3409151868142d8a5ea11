Nigeria’s anti-graft agency has deleted the tweet in which it claimed the agency’s boss Ibrahim Magu never said corruption caused coronavirus. “This information is false and misleading,” the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission said while reacting to The Cable report about the Magu’s remark. Magu’s remarks stunned his audience at the public event, which included President Muhammadu Buhari. The EFCC boss said the deadly virus, which has killed over 2000 people, was caused by corruption. “I strongly believe, your excellency, that even coronavirus is caused by corruption. Fighting corruption is like a crusade against the evils in our society,” he said. Before deleting the tweet, EFCC said Magu statement was misrepresented, claiming that the EFCC boss only said that “tackling corruption is a clarion call, given that corruption is a huge burden to the nation. It is worse than cancer, Ebola virus, coronavirus and all other deadly diseases put together.” The denial tweet is no longer on the EFCC’s timeline. But denial fell flat in the face of overwhelming video evidence and the agency did not offer any apologies to The Cable, whose report it wrongly described as “misleading” and “false”.
