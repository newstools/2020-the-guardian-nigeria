Madrid confirmed another fracture was revealed during tests on Sunday and Zidane has cast doubt on whether Hazard will return this term. “I don’t know if he will need an operation, it’s not my area,” said Zidane in a press conference before Madrid’s Champions League first leg against Manchester City at the Santiago Bernabeu on Wednesday. “And I don’t know if his season is over, I don’t know but I hope not.” Hazard joined Madrid for 100 million euros from Chelsea last summer but has endured a nightmare first year in Spain. He sustained a thigh injury in training the day before the start of the season and after coming back in September, took time to regain form and fitness. Hazard appeared to be finding his rhythm only to suffer his first fracture in November, before his latest setback last weekend. He has made only 15 appearances for his club this season, scoring one goal. “I can see he’s not happy,” said Zidane. “It’s important he stays positive but of course it’s difficult. It’s a bad moment, it won’t be easy and he will feel like this for a while.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
