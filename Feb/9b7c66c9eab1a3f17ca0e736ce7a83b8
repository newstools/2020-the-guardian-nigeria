As part of efforts aimed at bringing smiles to the faces of the needy in its host communities, presiding Bishop of The Redeemed Evangelical Mission (TREM) has commissioned a borehole donated by TREM City of Joy parish to residents of Olodi Apapa community. Resident Pastor, City of Joy, Olodi Apapa and Zonal Pastor of TREM churches in Lagos Zone 7, Revd. Chinedu Nkere, who spoke on behalf of Bishop Okonkwo, noted that one of the core values of TREM is to reach out to the needy and be responsible to the community where the church finds itself. According to him, we carried out an investigation to know the needs of the community in 2018 and we discovered that a lot of people in this community depend on well water, even some travel long distances to get drinkable water, hence the essence of providing the borehole. He added that other challenges facing the community are street light and accessible roads. “Olodi Apapa is a difficult place for people to walk without harassment especially women and we are planning to look in that direction. We want to make sure that our streets are well lit so that it can be safe for everybody to move about at any time in the night. Another major issue we discovered is bad roads. “As a church, we are partnering with other churches and people in the community to provide accessible road network. We are hoping that we can partner with local government and actualize this, because at the end, we will still be the beneficiary.
