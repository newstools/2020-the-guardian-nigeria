Imo State Judicial Commission of Inquiry on Contracts has indicted former Governor Rochas Okorocha over the alleged fraudulent award of contracts during his time as governor. It, therefore, ordered the state Auditor General and the Auditor General for Local Governments to submit their audited reports from June 2011 to May 2019 within seven days. The Commission’s Chairman, Justice Benjamin Iheka, gave the directive yesterday after two government officials gave startling revelations of how state funds were used under Okorocha. Auditor General, Ebenezer Osuji, told the commission that his office was neither aware of contracts the state government awarded, nor had documents of such contracts in the years under focus. “All contracts documents awarded by the state government ought to be sent to the Auditor General’s Office and Attorney General’s Office, but the provision was largely observed in breach within the period under review,” he said.
