 The colours of my dreams
 Glimmering in your eyes.
 This could be a trace,
 But deep in my whispers
 Lies the words I wish to say,
 ‘I love you’
 Lift my heart to Calvary
 Let my redemption flow
 from your touch.
 I had prayed for a miracle
 Before you found me.
 My love, you are my beacon,
 I just want to let you know. Imisioluwa Ogunsunlade to Olubunmi Elizabeth Ibukun Last night stung like the fangs of a frantic bee
 whose venoms think I stole their honey.
 Another dwindling dawn this morning did be,
 some still darkness dispossessed the sun in sunny. Up was the night and the day became sleep.
 And in that daydream, thoughts did come in a vague flurry.
 But one thing for sure my giddy eyes did see,
 in that ruckus and in that feat of things gory: bending over the canvas, a master stood.
 His robe, regal, and his tools, pure metal. His eyes pierced through the shadows of his dark hood
 and his cauldron roiled with things that looked fetal. Then, she conjured from the end of a theatrical tap.
 Alas! The masters greatest deed was done. The master’s apprentices fluxed into a clap.
 So too did the other newly-forged: they agreed that from these den of damsels, tis Honey the muse picks.
 After all, a masterpiece should be a Masters piece. Samuel Umoru I was told to write a poem about my feelings
 All I could think about was you
 You’re not just my muse
 You’re the totality of every emotion that I feel
 Cloud nine or palpitations
 All ends of the spectrum
 I feel any form of emotion and I remember how much deeper it was when I felt it for you
 Beneath the deepest recesses
 There’s this fear so besetting
 A pondering of some sorts
 A dread of how it would feel like in my world
 If I cease to be yours Pamilerin Jacob To Chidinma Ihezue It was like
 every other night.
 Your name snuck up on me,
 & pinned me
 to your scent.
 I reached for your
 hand in the sweltering
 dark & there it was,
 waiting for my clasp
 the way pages await
 eyes that will read them.
 And my heart tight
 as a wrestler’s
 fist, softened. Emmanuel Oloya I never knew the depth and hold you had on me
 I never knew I could be this forgiving and not wanting to let go
 Until that day you called to let me know you are going your way
 I felt immediately the emptiness of loneliness
 And the deception in finding satisfaction through living by me O how I realized your grip over me, stronger than the irresistible chill hands of death
 I recall the ecclesiastical allusion of Love as strong as death
 and longed for the perfect moment to unveil you as you are truly valued
 You are a visible definition of true love and affection
 Your smile and looks are a renewal of our love such that by day,
 it waxes stronger You are the epitome of beauty and a representation love virtue in character
 I can say it was a humongous triumph to have found you
 And now it is as new as ever!
 Skilz Scollivan to Bassey Thelma
 I love you with a love unyielding
 It would not bend to being shunned
 It would not fracture to heartbreak
 As the sun stands firm in place
 Ever burning and wandering in it’s bask
 So is my love for you sweet one;
 Firm, unyielding and ever-burning Alma Flinch to Annie Alexa The story that I love
 Is that there aren’t words
 Nor art sufficient enough
 And when I set pen on paper
 To scribble down my heart,
 I realized the truth of it:
 No words or art was right enough
 To really portray your grace
 When you smiled ever so shyly Tochima to Ezeh Chinenye Gloria You belong to me and I to you
 My tail-fin,
 Without you, I cannot swim
 My heart has been split in two like an apple
 By the mere thought of thinking of you
 I melt like a snowflake when I’m around you
 I smile, you smile
 I cry you cry
 Truly you are my everything
 When God created man, you were first on the queue.
 We are meant for each other,
 One cannot do without the other
 I cannot bear the thought of losing you
 My reason for being would have no meaning
 My world would end if you are not in Daud Osumah Like the bush fire effect during harmattan, your love swept freely through my heart, body and soul A love my rock-solid heart couldn’t resist
 You broke all of my defences
 All of my resistance
 You neutralized all of my obstinacies
 You took my ego; feed me with it, making sure none was left to be eaten later!
 This love turned out to be a soothing balm to a dying soul
 Heartrobe, if you’re sand on my palm,
 I’d protect you from slipping through my palm
 even when the earth trembles
 If you’re water and I’ve just a basket to “accommodate” you, I’d rip off my skin to wrap the basket and prevent you from dripping
 If you’re a small stream that needs to transform into an ocean,
 I’d bleed till the last drop of my blood to aid your transformation
 Even if your love floats in the air, I’d defy gravity to remain afloat with you.
