The National Examination Council (NECO) has released the results of the 2019 November/December Senior School Certificate Examinations (SSCE). Abubakar Gana, Acting Registrar of the council, made this known in a statement in Abuja on Thursday. Gana said that a total of 70,140 candidates registered for the examination, and 65,207 sat for the English Language out of which 41,214, representing 63 per cent, got either Distinction or Credit. He added that 66,398 candidates sat for Mathematics, out of which 54,565, representing 82.18 per cent, got either Distinction or Credit. The acting registrar said 33,576 candidates, representing 48.68 per cent, got five Credits and above, including English Language and Mathematics. “On the other hand, 50,057 candidates, representing 72.57% got five Credits and above, irrespective of English Language and Mathematics. “A comparative analysis of candidates who scored five Credits and above, including English Language and Mathematics for 2018 and 2019 shows 62.48% for 2018 and 48.68% for 2019,” he stated. The acting registrar said the figure represented a decrease of 13.8 per cent in 2019. “This is coming exactly 49 days after the last paper was written. A total of 29 subjects were examined. “Like we always point out, this is an examination conducted for external candidates wishing to acquire the minimum requirements for admission into various tertiary institutions,” he added. Gana, however, noted that not all candidates required Credit in either English Language or Mathematics or both. On candidates’ involvement in examination malpractice in 2019 as against 2018, he said there was an increase as 12,084 cases were recorded in 2018 as against 17,004 recorded in 2019. “This came about as a result of the comprehensive monitoring by senior staff. This also resulted in the decline in number of candidates with 5 Credits and above,” he said. He called on candidates to log on to www.neco.gov.ng, and click on ‘NECO Results’ and follow the prompts to access their results.
