Justice Ayokunle Faji of the Federal High Court, Lagos has fixed February 7, 2020 for judgment in a suit seeking the removal of the Director General of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), Brigadier-General Shuaibu Ibrahim.
   
Lagos-based lawyer and human rights activists, Inibehe Effiong, had sued President Muhammadu Buhari, Nigerian Army, Chief of Army Staff, NYSC, Brigadier General Shuaibu Ibrahim and the Attorney General of the Federation, Mr Abubakar Malami, (SAN) in suit number FHC/L/CS/764/2019 before the court over the appointment of the new NYSC DG by the Chief of Army Staff last year.
   
In his originating summons filed on May 9, 2019, the claimant asked the court to determine whether in view of the extant provisions of Section 5 (1) of the National Youth Service Corps Act, Cap. N84 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 2004, any other authority or person outside the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria can validly appoint the Director-General of the National Youth Service Corps.  He therefore urged the court to apply the provisions of Section 167 (d) of the Evidence Act, 2011 and to hold that the defendants withheld the documents because it is against them.
   
On the issue of locus standi, Effiong drew the attention of the court to a recent decision by a full panel of the Supreme Court in the case of Centre for Oil Pollution Watch V. N.N.P.C (2019) 5 NWLR (PT. 1666) Page 518 where the Apex Court held that public spirited citizens and NGOs now have the locus standi to institute public interest cases.
