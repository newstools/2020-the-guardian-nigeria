The feud between the two female rap stars dominated the media for a majority of 2019 and even almost led to a catfight at a fashion party save for the timely intervention of bodyguards. A gay couple, Don’te and D’Andrew Leaphart has taken their varying love for the rappers to a new turn as they headed to a divorce court following a disagreement about the rappers. The couple who have been together for a little under five years dated for two and a half years and have been married for two. When asked by a judge the reason for their separation, one of them explains that it is their different support for Nicki Minaj and Cardi B as while one of them is Team Nicki, the other is on the Cardi train. He then went on explaining that they were discussing “who started what” in regards to Cardi and Nicki’s infamous beef before things got heated. “I admit, it was silly,” Don’te chimed in, adding that he is on Team Cardi while his partner is on Team Nicki. The other refutes this as he explains that his partner is ungrateful and the disagreement about Nicki Minaj and Cardi B only escalated the underlying issue causing the separation. The couple went viral after the episode. “Can u imagine saying Cardi is a better rapper than Nicki(or vice versa) and end up with divorce papers in ur hand,” one said. “These 2 dudes on divorce court broke up over the Nicki and Cardi beef I’m crying,” another reacted. Watch them argue about it below:  There are currently different versions as to why the two entertainers are not on good terms. Following their altercation at Harper’s Bazaar’s ICONS party at New York fashion week, Cardi B explained that she went after Nicki Minaj because the latter talked bad about her daughter, Kulture. Cardi and Minaj have been rap rivals since Cardi B began achieving huge success since the release of her debut album “Invasion of Privacy.”
