Following his Grammy Nomination, Burna Boy has become a little bit more vocal, airing his thoughts which have not sat well with many. He recently called out Nigerian artistes, without mentioning any names, for paying and begging for popularity abroad; this sparked outrage on Twitter. He further went on to say ‘he is the best Nigerian artiste after the legendary Fela’.

However, it appears Seun Kuti has had enough of the Burna Boy’s bragging; to somewhat clear the air on the whole Grammy nomination craze, Kuti talked about how the academy reached out to him concerning why his album wasn’t sent in, even after nominations had closed.

First to miss a Grammy Performance, who else can say that? It’s not easy to be chosen it’s even harder to miss it ….. Now seriously, I took my self to this nomination on the shoulder of the great African artistes who came before me many of them in my very own band. I had no support and today I can confidently tell the world that my record label, after telling me they did, secretly decided NOT TO ENTER MY ALBUM! The Grammys reached out to me themselves after the entry period had closed. They said they wanted to know why I have never entered my albums and especially the black times’ album I had just put out cos they loved it and thought it should be entered! The surprise was an understatement. I couldn’t believe what I was reading! The rest they say is history!! Those that have all the support from corporations and especially the people who because I fight for them even my record company tried to silence me, they say they do it alone I just have to smile!!!” Burna Boy was among the nominees for the World Best Album for the already held Grammy awards. Unfortunately, he lost to Angelique Kidjo.
