The Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA) has confirmed that a yet-to-be-identified man jumped into the Lagos lagoon from the Third Mainland Bridge, yesterday. Public Affairs Officer LASEMA, Nosa Okunbor, who confirmed the incident to The Guardian said officials of the agency were making efforts to rescue the victim as at press time. The Guardian learnt that the man reportedly hired a car-hailing service from Gbagada to the Island, but deceived the UBER driver that he had a running stomach after which he jumped into the lagoon. He reportedly told the driver of the car to stop after which he immediately jumped into the water. “He should be in his mid-20s. He ordered a car-hailing service from Gbagada to the Island. He deceived the UBER driver that he had a running stomach after which he jumped into the lagoon,” Okunbor said. “As I speak with you, the marine unit of the Lagos central zone has been searching for the victim since 11:30am, but we have not found the body.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
