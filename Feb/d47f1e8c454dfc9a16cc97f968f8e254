The Guardian gathered that government has already begun assessment needs of the facility following its determination to ensuring sufficient gas in the country. Port Harcourt Zonal Operations Controller of Department for Petroleum Resources (DPR), Bassey Nkanga, who disclosed this during a technical workshop organized by the agency for LPG Depot Operators, Refilling Plants and Retailers, noted that already, two gas depots in the state are receiving products from NLNG and distributing to operators.
