For the umpteenth time, we would like to reiterate the profound and definitive point about restructuring this convoluted federation. There is no doubt anymore that the current system not helped by method of political engagement, administration and inter-ethnic relations, has failed the Nigerian people. It has virtually stagnated initiatives from the constituent parts of the federation. Security of life and property has all but broken down. The current Federal Government runs an inefficient and clannish bureaucracy from the presidency, seizing control of security apparatus with a clearly nefarious goal. 
 
Indeed, despite the groundswell of opinion against the retrogressive unitary system by this newspaper, the federal authorities still consider the states as mere appendages or vassals that should receive orders or benevolence from Abuja, where incompetence and confusion reign supreme. State governors, elected by the people, cringe before the Federal Government for fear of being manipulated out of political reckoning or being hounded after their days in office. The Exclusive List in the Federal Constitution is also a serious bottleneck. It has prevented states from developing local resources, where they have a natural advantage to boost their economies. We have noted repeatedly here that Nigeria, the most populous black nation on earth, cannot be run like a military barrack anymore. It is too big for a command-and-obey structure. Thus, patriots have repeatedly made the point that we need to review governance and institutions as a way of moving the nation forward.  A system where serving generals are taking orders from an unelected personal staff officer to the commander-in-chief is in need of urgent restructuring.  All of these are indicative of a failed structure. The level of mutual distrust among leaders and ethnic groups is disheartening and frightening. By design or default, the president has distanced himself from the hard realities on the ground. The security strategy, if strategy it is, has failed to protect the people. The time has come to work out a new security system that diffuses command and control, knowing that security issues are usually local. In the main, while using the El Rufai committee document as a reference point, the Senate committee should also remember the report of the 2014 National Conference this newspaper has always reminded the nation about. That conference made fundamental recommendations, which arose from a national consensus. We should not throw away the proverbial baby with the bath water. Wide consultations are needed to sooth nerves across the country. Rampaging herdsmen of Fulani stock have managed to destabilise the country. Boko Haram is still waging an attrition battle in the northeast with kidnappings and murders dominating the headlines. The Nigeria Army appears overwhelmed. Though the service chiefs still appear to enjoy the confidence of the president, Nigerians are getting worried that the unending war in the northeast is a result of incompetence and lack of innovative ideas.
