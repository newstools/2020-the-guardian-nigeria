‘Friends cast| Photo: Variety The entire crew of “Friends” is coming back for a special! Variety reports that the cast is reuniting for an untitled unscripted special on HBO Max, and the gang too, shared on their Instagram that “It’s happening!” Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer — will be present, returning to their original soundstage for the first time since 2004. In addition, all 6 stars are expected to receive about $2.5 million each for appearing in the eagerly anticipated reunion, and it will air on HBO Max, together with all 10 seasons of the show, after the streaming service’s debut. The reunion has been highly anticipated, with speculation about the HBO Max special rumored since last fall, just months after the WarnerMedia-created SVOD platform nabbed the streaming rights to the show from Netflix in a deal with Warner Bros. Television. All 10 seasons of the comedy left Netflix at the end of 2019, meaning that “Friends” has thus far not been available to stream in the U.S. this calendar year — at least, not until HBO Max launches in May.
