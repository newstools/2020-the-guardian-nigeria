There was unusual stampede in Akure, the capital city of Ondo State yesterday as people ran helter skelter because of a widespread rumour of bank robbery. Many, including commuters, customers and bankers along Oke-Aro road, where it was said that the armed robbery operation was taking place, were seen running for safety at about 10:00a.m. while banks and shops in the area were hurriedly closed. The rumour came barely two weeks after some banks were robbed at Ileoluji, headquarters of Ileoluji/Okeigbo Local Government Area of the state, killing two persons and two police officers. A banker in one of the first generation banks located along Oke-Aro, who pleaded for anonymity, disclosed that police officers stormed their bank and ordered them to shut down for security reasons. According to him, all the bank personnel had to scamper out of the bank premises while customers that were in the bank hall suspended their business transactions as they fled so as not to be caught unaware. The Ondo State police command, Nigeria Army and other security agencies promptly rose up to the occasion to forestall any attack by armed robbers. Different checkpoints were mounted at strategic points to inspect all vehicles going to and from the area, while security vans were patrolling the capital city. But the state Police Public Relations Officer, Mr. Femi Joseph, dispelled the robbery report as untrue and allayed the fears of the people, saying “No bank robbery anywhere in Ondo State.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
