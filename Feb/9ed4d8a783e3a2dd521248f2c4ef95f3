The federal high court in Abuja on Wednesday adjourned the trial of Sahara Reporters publisher Omoyele Sowore till Thursday, February 13. The court also awarded N200,000 damages against the Department of State Security (DSS) payable to Sowore for frivolous reasons for adjournments. The judge took the step to allow amended charges against the two men to be accommodated in the court’s proceedings. Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka and a former Nigerian lawmaker Shehu Sani were at the resumed trial in solidarity of Sowore and his co-defendant Olawale Bakare. Also in court was the former chairman of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), Professor Chidi Odinkalu and activist Deji Adeyanju. Sowore was arrested on Saturday, August 3 after calling for a nationwide protest tagged #RevolutionNow by the DSS. The government accused Sowore and his co-defendant Olawale Bakare treasonable felony, money laundering, terrorism and plotting to overthrow Nigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari. The court had on two occasions ordered Sowore’s bail but was denied by the DSS for undisclosed reasons.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
