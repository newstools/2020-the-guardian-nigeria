The Anglican Diocese of Amichi recently held its rededication service of the staff and students of Holy Child Convent, Amichi for 2019/2020 second term academic activities. At the programme, the Diocesan Bishop, Ikeakor, called on Christians to frequently rededicate their lives and services to God. The Bishop said believers are in constant interaction with the world in their daily activities and so, there was a need for them to constantly renew themselves in God’s power and grace. He said: “The Christmas and New Year season gave staff and students the opportunity to travel to various places and interact with friends, relatives and people in the wider society. There is, therefore, the need to make a fresh commitment to God and receive strength for activities of the new term.” Speaking on the theme: Deliverance, the cleric expressed worry at the high level of demonic activities going on in the society, especially among youths. He outlined demonic possession, oppression, and obsession as the three levels of demonic activities affecting people’s lives. He declared that no matter the level of demonic activity in a man’s life, whenever he/she decides to return to God in repentance, God is ever ready to grant him/her complete deliverance. He encouraged the students to shun laziness and seriously face their academic activities. The occasion featured fervent prayers for the staff and students, special songs rendition by the chapel choir and thanksgiving to God in appreciation of His mercies.
