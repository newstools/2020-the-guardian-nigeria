•Accuses ruling party of intimidating judges
•APC support groups urge S’Court to appraise Bayels, Zamfara rulings The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) yesterday said it was approaching the Supreme Court to seek a review of its judgment on the petition it filed in respect of the 2019 presidential election.This is just as the main opposition party accused the All Progressives Congress (APC) of intimidating judges of the apex to force a reversal of its verdicts on Bayelsa and Zamfara states. The PDP, at a press conference addressed by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, in Abuja, stated that it would also tasked the apex court to take a second look at the governorship elections in Kano, Kaduna, Katsina and Osun states.The text of the press conference was tagged, “Position of the PDP on the desperation of the APC to subjugate, intimidate for the purpose of annexing the Supreme Court over Imo, Bayelsa and Zamfara governorship election judgments.” The party said it found it “ludicrous, ridiculous and insulting to the sensibilities and respect of the Supreme Court justices for the APC to hurriedly and malevolently head to the Supreme Court to attempt to arm-twist the lord justices to effect a forceful reversal of the valid, flawless and faultless judgments on Bayelsa and Zamfara states’ governorship elections.” The party further disclosed that it would also seek the review of the Supreme Court verdict on the Katsina governorship election petition.“The PDP equally has no choice than to ask the Supreme Court to review the Kano, Kaduna and Katsina election judgments because of manifest violence and substantial non-compliance to our electoral law. The PDP will also ask the Supreme Court to review its judgment on the Osun governorship election in view of manifest, complete and total disregard to our electoral rules in the conduct of the elections,” Ologbondiyan added. Also yesterday, the Group of All Registered APC Support Groups (ARAS-g) enjoined the apex court to review its earlier rulings on Bayelsa and Zamfara, which nullified all candidates of the ruling party in the 2019 general elections in the North West state.Addressing a press conference in Abuja, chairman of the group, Ezedinma Nonso David, stressed the need for the “will of the electorate to prevail in the respective states.”He, however, sanctioned the declaration of Hope Uzodinma as the duly elected Governor of Imo state.
