The Akwa Ibom State House of Assembly has inaugurated its last entrant to complete the 26-member legislature. Swearing in the representative of Essien Udim State Constituency, Mr. Esse Umoh, yesterday in Uyo, Speaker Aniekan Bassey urged him to be committed to his new assignment of making laws for the peace and progress of the state. The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) lawmaker emerged victorious in the by-election held on January 25 this year where he polled 18,999 votes to defeat his closest rival, Mr. Nse Ntuen of the All Progressives Congress (APC) who got 7,108  ballots. Ntuen, the former occupant, had his seat declared vacant by the leadership of the assembly when he defected from the PDP to the APC in 2018.
