• Firm re-emphasises commitment to boost agric exports Border closure against importation and smuggling of agro-allied products is an indication of absolute lack of confidence in the Nigeria Customs Service, stakeholders have said, commending the action as disincentive to smuggling and a boost to agricultural productivity in Nigeria. Vice President of the Nigeria Agribusiness Group (NABG), Mr Emmanuel Ijewere, said this during an agric expo in Lagos, reiterating that farmers do produce over 100 per cent of food need of Nigerians but lose same to poor post-harvest management. Similarly, while its boss was delivering a paper on ‘Effective Ground Handling & Preservation – Critical factors for mitigating challenges to Agriculture Export,’ Nigeria Aviation Handling Company has re-emphasised its commitment to the growth and development of agricultural export in the nation as it expanded its facilities to boost the volume of export of products the company handles by 68%. The development became important following the Federal Government’s border policy, as that birthed the need for Nigeria to produce enough for consumption as well as export food products to boost the nation’s economy. These were disclosed by the Group Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of the company, Mrs Tokunbo Fagbemi, at the Africa Agric Expo. Fagbemi outlined the factors retarding the growth of the sector and explained that the company’s aim was to eradicate a situation where Nigerian exported goods are returned to the country over inability to meet international standards. Assuring stakeholders of a brighter and better 2020, the Nahco aviance boss revealed that the aviation handling firm was ready to work with others to boost agricultural value chain and work towards reducing the wastage, especially as a result of lack of equipment to preserve them.She said, “Nahco aviance has increased its volume of export of agricultural products by about 68%, having spent about $2 million to expand its facilities while improving on security for exported products.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
