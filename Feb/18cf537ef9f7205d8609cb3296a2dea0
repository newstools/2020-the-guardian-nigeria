Prison Chronicles, a stage play, about the prison system and life, will be one of the features in this year’s edition of the Lagos Theatre Festival (LTF).Written by Wole Oguntokun, with Austine Onuoha directing, the political satire will be produced by Nevana Productions. The play promises to showcase arrays of stars, including Ohye Harry, Achalugo Chioma Ezekobe, Stanley Okeke, Chibuikem Chris and Adeniran Olamilekan. Aside from x-raying the happenings in the society and how some innocent young people find their ways in prison, this edition will be performed at the Freedom Park and inside the former prison rooms of the colonial masters. With this, Onuoha hopes to bring to life the sorrow, sadness and camaraderie that exist among prisoners.  The play will be presented to the audience on February 28 by 5.00pm, Feb 29 (4.00pm and 6.00pm) and March 1 at 3.00pm and 5.00pm. Speaking on the play, the director, Austine Onuoha, said: “My approach to this performance is experiential theatre, where the audience is close enough to the play; almost taking part in it. This dynamic style makes for greater audience participation and matches the festival theme, Going Out Of Bounds. It is my sincere desire that people leave with the reflections about our country’s correctional facilities.” He disclosed that the choice of the venue, which is the prison cellblocks in Freedom Park, was reached, as a way to making the audience to be closer to the characters and to have a real 3D experience.He noted that the play is a satire that gives the audience the authentic perspectives from inmates ranging from a witty fraudster, a man of the law turned rogue, a multi-count murderer, to a falsely accused convict. Annually LTF partners the British Council, Nigeria, to host stage performances and present different plays. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
