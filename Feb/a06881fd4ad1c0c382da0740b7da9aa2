The Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), Zone A, has seized about 147 sacks of pangolin scales weighing 9,504.1kg worth N10.26 billion.The Pangolins or scaly anteaters are mammals of the order Pholidota, with the demand for pangolin scales and meat driving pangolins toward extinction.
   
The Comptroller-General of Customs (CGC), Hameed Ali, who disclosed this in Lagos, said Nigeria, as a signatory to CITES (Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species), categorises this specie under absolute prohibition; therefore, its importation or trade is illegal globally.  Other items seized were: 575 pieces of used tyres, 703 cartons of foreign poultry products, 543 jerry cans of petroleum products and 416 bales of used clothing, among others, with a Duty Paid Value (DPV) of N303.2 million making a cumulative duty paid value of N10.5 billion within the month under review (January 7 to February 3, 2020).
   
Ali said the seizures underscored the Service’s determination to enforce all laws relating to importation and exportation of goods, thereby contributing to the economy, security and wellbeing of every Nigerian.He commended the Ag. Comptroller, FOU ‘A’, DC Usman Yahaya, and other members of the unit for a job well done, considering that he took over barely a month ago.
