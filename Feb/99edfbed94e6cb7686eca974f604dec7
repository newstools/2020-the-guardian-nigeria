The Simpsons Coronavirus | Image: The Hook Fans and lovers of American animated sitcom “The Simpsons” must believe that either Homer (the lead character) or the producers of the sitcom possess a crystal ball from which they foresee events before they happen. A few days ago, social media went ablaze after screenshots of scenes from The Simpsons surfaced in which some Asian characters had a flu virus which eventually spread to the United States. Fans of the comic series have declared this as a prediction of the Corona Virus outbreak that originated late last year in Wuhan, China. Did The Simpsons Really Predict The Corona Virus?
The viral screenshots were taken from the 21st episode of The Simpsons’ fourth season which aired in 1993 — titled “Marge in Chains” — in which many of Springfield’s residents purchase “Juice Looseners” through the mail, which are inefficient and loud juicers built in Osaka and shipped from there. One of the assembly line workers has the flu and coughs into the box destined for Homer, filling it with airborne germs. When the Juice Looseners arrive in Springfield, the Osaka Flu hits the town and many of the townspeople are affected by the illness.  Osaka Flu / Corona Virus
Although the Osaka Flu and the Coronavirus have some similarities, the later is however deadlier. Osaka / Wuhan
The Osaka Flu originates from the Osaka in Japan. The Coronavirus, however, was identified in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei, a province in China. The Osaka Flu is definitely not the Coronavirus. As of 3 February 2020, approximately 17,486 cases worldwide and 362 deaths have been confirmed from the Coronavirus. The outbreak has been declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) by the World Health Organization (WHO), explaining that its decision was based on the possible effects that the pathogen could have if it spreads to countries with weaker healthcare infrastructures.
