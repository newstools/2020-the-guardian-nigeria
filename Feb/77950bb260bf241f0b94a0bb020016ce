The children were on a footpath when the four-wheel drive jumped the curb and rammed into them, police alleged. Three girls aged 8 to 12 and a 13-year-old boy died at the scene and two other girls and a boy were injured and taken to hospital, where they were in a stable condition Sunday, police said. The dead included two sisters and their brother, three of the six children of Daniel and Leila Abdallah. “Yesterday I lost three of my children. I had a cousin, Bridget, she lost her daughter as well,” Daniel Abdallah told reporters Sunday morning. “I’m numb, probably that’s how I feel at the moment,” he said. “All I just want to say is, please, drivers be careful. These kids were just walking innocently, enjoying each others’ company and this morning I woke up, I have lost three kids.” A makeshift memorial was later put up where the accident occurred, with people coming to place flowers, teddy bears and candles as well as pay their respects. The driver, whose name has not been released, was due in court Sunday facing 20 charges.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
