Ahead of the change of ownership (demutualisation) of the Nigerian Sock Exchange (NSE), stakeholders in Nigeria’s capital market have been urged to collaborate, especially in the area of shared services to tackle infractions and high incidence of unclaimed dividend in the market.
  
Besides, there is a need for operators to continuously put in the public domain initiatives that could help investors to be better informed on developments in the market that would help them in making the right decisions.
  
A Professor of Economics, Babcock University, Segun Ajibola, speaking at the inauguration of a new Governing Council for the Institute of Capital Market Registrars (ICMR), weekend, argued that infractions such as market manipulations, insider trading and unclaimed dividends can’t happen if operators and regulators live up to their responsibility.  The President of the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), Abimbola Ogunbanjo, said the demutualisation of the Exchange would further enhance capital market operation by promoting high level of corporate governance in the market.	He added that it would boost transparency and attract more strategic partners, investors and quality issuers in the market.
