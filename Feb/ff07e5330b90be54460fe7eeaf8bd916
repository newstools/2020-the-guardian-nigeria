Multi-talented artiste Runtown comes through with the visuals for the latest single titled “Body Riddim“, featuring Darkovibes and Bella Shmurda. “Body Riddim” is a melodious, Afro-pop tune that describes and expresses the physical attraction Runtown feels for his love interest. It’s a whole new vibe with an experimental flow and perfect blend of Afro-pop and highlife. Runtown infuses the sounds from traditional instruments – shekere, talking drum among others – to deliver a great tune. The video for “Body Riddim” was shot in Lagos, and directed by Adasa Cookey.
