For Nigeria to combat the menace of Boko Haram and other cases of extreme violence, the Brazilian Minister for External Relations, Ernesto Araujo, has said a strong political will is crucial.
  
Araujo who visited the country recently on bilateral talks on defense, legal, trade and investment, noted that fighting extreme violence does not require any form of compromise with the culprits. “Some countries, sometimes, face similar challenges and they have the temptation of compromising. There should be no compromise,” he said.  He said: “This drug trafficking helps feed terrorism and Boko Haram in the Sahel and elsewhere. So, we want to address that bilaterally through security cooperation.
 
“We want to have more coordination to fight corridor drug trafficking from the Gulf of Guinea especially. We are putting whatever we can into it. More people in Brazil have realised that criminal activities, today, are all connected. “Before now, we had a doctrine that tended to see drug trafficking separately from terrorism and terrorism separate from organised crime and separate from corruption. But now, we see all these as a whole, and it is clear that we have to be partners in the fight, because we are on the two sides of the problem across the South Atlantic.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
