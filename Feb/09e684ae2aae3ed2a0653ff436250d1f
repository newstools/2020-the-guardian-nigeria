 One of the victims   <br />  While chasing some cult boys, the police had accidentally shot two men but who fortunately did not die. A statement made available by the state police public relations officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, explained that the two victims of the gunshot are alive and responding to treatment at the state general hospital, Ijaiye Abeokuta where they were rushed to by the officers of the command. The Commissioner of Police, Kenneth Ebrimson, who was at the scene of the incident at the weekend, has also visited the victims in the hospital where he met them in a very stable condition. “As this morning (Saturday), the officers of the command have visited them in the hospital and they were responding well to treatment. “Meanwhile, a full-scale investigation into the case has commenced as directed by the Commissioner of Police with the view to unraveling the immediate and remote cause of the crisis and sanction appropriately those that will be found wanting in one way or the other so as to forestall the re-occurrence of such ugly incident.” The statement appealed to members of the public, especially Facebook and other social media users, to desist from spreading fake and unverified information as this is capable of causing chaos and unwarranted shedding of blood.
