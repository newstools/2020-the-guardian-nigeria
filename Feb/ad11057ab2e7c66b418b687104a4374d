Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni, yesterday, said the seeming ambition of Kaduna State Governor, Malam Nasiru El-Rufaâ€™i and All Progressives Congress (APC) party leader, Alhaji Bola Ahmed Tinubu to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023 would not destabilise the ruling party. He also rejected the idea of power rotation for the 2023 general election. Speaking in an interview on the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) Hausa, yesterday, Buni said APC would be on a sound footing because the President had already laid a solid foundation through good governance. He also criticised the agitation that power should rotate in 2023 to other geo- political regions, insisting that doing so would limit the chances of Nigerians to make choices.
