Kano State Government has denied claims of its involvement in the fresh investigation against the Emirate Council over an alleged land racketeering. The state anti-graft agency is accusing Emir Sanusi-led emirate council of sales of landed properties belonging to the Kano Emirate without the state government permission, The Guardian learnt. It was also gathered that the Emirate, banking on its local authority, disposed of the said hectares of land, running into millions of naira, without official knowledge of Kano State Land Bureau. Although, a source at the Emirate told our correspondent that anti-graft investigation was part of deliberate harassment being orchestrated by the state government. Reacting to the insinuation, Commissioner for Information, Malam Muhammad Garba, however, insisted Governor Ganduje has no hand in the ongoing investigation. Garba maintained that the anti-graft commission needed no interference since it is backed by relevant laws to carry out such investigations. He points out that as it did occur in the past, where it even involved senior civil servants and political office holders, Governor Ganduje did not interfere with the activities of the commission and only learnt about the probe when it got to the press. “Governor Ganduje holds no grudges against the monarch, and even the issue of the creation of new Emirates in the state, which appears to be at the centre of the stuff, followed due process,” Garba said.
