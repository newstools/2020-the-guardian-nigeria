A Kano High Court sitting in Audu Bako Secretariat yesterday quashed the suit instituted by four Kano kingmakers challenging the creation of four First Class emirs in the state. The four traditional high chiefs under the Emir of Kano, Malam Muhammadu Sanusi II, had sued Governor Abdullah Umar Ganduje, Speaker, Kano State House of Assembly, Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice and the new First Class emirs over the legality of the new laws. They approached the court asking it to declare the laws illegal, unconditional null and void. Delivery his judgment, Justice Ahmad Badamasi averred that the validity of the law was the whole issue for determination. The judge, who cited the verdict of Justice Usman Na’Abba of similar jurisdiction of same subject matter, insisted that series of events had overshadowed the prayers of the plaintiffs. He noted that the court had taken judicial notice of judgment delivered by Justice Na’Abba dated November 21, 2019, nullifying the law. He, however, insisted that any action taken might amount to nullity, devoid of no legal effect. After the nullification of the emirate law, Kano State Executive Council had instituted fresh emirate bill to the state Assembly, which had since passed and signed into law. The new Kano emirs’ appointment and deposition law 2019 was seen by many as affront to traditional heritage of Kano emirate and deliberate attempt to cripple the influence of Emir Muhammadu Sanusi.
