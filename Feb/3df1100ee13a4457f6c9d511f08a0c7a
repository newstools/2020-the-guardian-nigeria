In a tweet, Abike Dabiri, the chairman of Nigerians in Diaspora Commission has said Lil Wayne is welcome to visit Nigeria anytime he wants in reaction to the video released by Lil Wayne saying he is 53% Nigerian. Our Nigerian brother . Many doing their DNA and identifying their roots. We look forward to welcoming him home someday soon https://t.co/pSKluJhGmb — Abike Dabiri-Erewa (@abikedabiri) February 5, 2020  African-American rapper, Lil Wayne was recently a guest on the “Drink Champ” show that airs Revolt TV and during his chat with hosts N.O.R.E. and DJ EFN, he revealed that he is 53% Nigerian. When asked by N.O.R.E why he mentioned Nigeria in the lyrics of one of his hit songs, the multiple Grammy award-winning rapper disclosed that he had an ancestry test conducted by a website he shared some of his details on. However, this is not the first time Lil Wayne has shown an interest to visit Nigeria. Weeks ago, while playing “Never Ever Have I”, he was asked about the one place in the world that he would love to visit and he mentioned Nigeria and Egypt. Furthermore, one of Lil Wayne’s signees, Nicki Minaj has also expressed a desire to visit Nigeria. Her interest in Nigeria may have been sparked by Cardi’s recent visit as the “Barbie Dripz” crooner said she loves the energy from the country.
