The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Ilorin Zonal Office, has secured the final forfeiture of a building belonging to Adebayo Sanni, the immediate past Executive Director of Harmony Holdings Limited of Kwara State Government. Justice Sikiru Oyinloye of Kwara State High Court sitting in Ilorin granted the application filed by EFCC counsel, Sesan Ola, after the respondent failed to appear in court to challenge the legality of the proceedings. The applicant, in a 35-paragraph affidavit deposed to by Denis Nnachi, an investigative officer, said, “Investigations revealed that the ex-Kwara executive director fraudulently sold five plots of land belonging to the state government in Galadimawa area of Abuja and used it to construct the building in question.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
