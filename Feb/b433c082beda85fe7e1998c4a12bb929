APC leaders suspend Idahosa Oyo State Governor Seyi Makinde yesterday dismissed purported violence in Saturday’s ward congresses of the party in Edo State.The chairman of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) congresses in Edo, who commended the party faithful for peaceful and orderly conduct of the congresses across the 192 wards, said the exercise was concluded in five council areas, insisting that the electoral officers must visit the 192 wards. Briefing journalists on the ward congresses to elect new party officials in Benin City, Makinde said opposition parties sponsored the purported violence to paint the process in bad light. He applauded the sense of maturity and sportsmanship demonstrated by members of the party, noting that the entire process was peaceful. Expressing satisfaction with the process, Makinde said it was normal for some persons to express displeasure in this type of political contest, adding, “We have made a lot of progress. “The electoral officers came in late because we insisted they must get to all the 192 wards. Some of the villages are across rivers. The exercise went on peacefully. You can see all the committee members. You can see the team collating results. “It is the opposition imagination about crisis. They want to paint us in bad light. Skirmishes are normal, but we handled all the issues. It has been a peaceful and orderly process. “All the electoral officers are here. I endorsed the photocopies of results and I am going through the serial numbers. All the aspirants are happy.”Meanwhile, the Uhunmhode Council Area Area chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) passed a vote of no confidence on its leader, Charles Idahosa for allegedly promoting factionalisation among its members It also suspended him from the party consequently after the vote of no confidence following a motion for his removal by a former State Auditor of the party, Joe Imasuen and supported by Roland Orobor of ward six. They accused Idahosa of appropriating the APC in Uhunmwode to himself and running it as if it was his private property.“The APC, Uhunmwode Council Chapter has witnessed unprecedented leadership failure under Idahosa, which has resulted in underdevelopment of the local government area. “Idahosa has appropriated the party to himself and therefore runs and conducts the affairs as if it is his privately owned limited liability company where he is both Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer.” However, efforts to contact Idahosa proved abortive, as calls made to his phone were not answered.It also appointed a former Commissioner for Health in the Governor Godwin Obaseki-led administration, Professor David Osifo, to replace Idahosa as the party leader in the area.
