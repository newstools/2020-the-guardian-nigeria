The All Progressives Congress (APC) yesterday suspended an aide to Governor Godwin Obaseki, Mr. Kaycee Osamwonyi, for allegedly engaging in hooliganism and causing factions within the party. Kaycee was suspended in Ward 6 in Uhunmwode Council Area after a motion for his suspension was moved by Harrison Orobor and adopted by party members at a meeting. He was suspended for allegedly engaging in activities that have brought the APC to ridicule and opprobrium in Ward 06, promoting subversion and breaching the partyâ€™s constitution. A disciplinary committee was set up to review the allegations against Kaycee and submit its report within two weeks. When contacted Kaycee promised to respond but did not respond as at press time.
