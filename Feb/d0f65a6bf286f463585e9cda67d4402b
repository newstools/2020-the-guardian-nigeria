Playing for the team and scoring goals means a lot to me. I am going to cherish this moment for all the days of my life.” The 30-year-old striker, who is currently on loan from Chinese Super League side Shanghai Greenland Shenhua, also dedicated his goal to his late sister, who sadly passed away six weeks before his dream move to Old Trafford. After scoring, Ighalo unveiled a T-shirt carrying a picture of his sister, who he said “She was a good United fan too.” “We hoped for this moment but, now I am at United, she is not here to see what is going on. It is emotional for me. I have promised myself that every goal I score, I will dedicate it to her. She is up there watching me.” Despite the sadness behind marking his first United goal, Ighalo was also delighted to get on the scoresheet in his first start following a run of three substitute appearances.
