But the hotel he said, accused him of not paying his bills on foods in the hotel for six years, for which he issued a cheque of N20million and told them that he needs proof of their claims. “After two days, his cheque was returned back to him on account that he should not bother himself with the allegation,” he stated, through his media adviser Fidelis Chukwuma.” But to his surprise when he decided to move his cars out from the hotel premises, the hotel management prevented him, thereby stalling the removal of four cars belonging to his company and other properties worth over N400million on the account that he owed the hotel N18million. Irked by the development, the businessman, approached a Federal High Court sitting in Lagos and filed his case with all documental pieces of evidence.” “But amusingly, since April 2019 till date, the case with Suit No. FHC/L/CS/630/2019 has not been put up for hearing and has continued to suffer several baseless adjournments by the assigned Judge for the case,” he alleged.
