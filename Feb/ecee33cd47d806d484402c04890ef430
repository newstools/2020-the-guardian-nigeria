• NCC to auction spectrum soon
Commercialisation of fifth-generation (5G) networks in Nigeria will be impacted negatively by power infrastructure gaps that currently exist in the country. Besides, the current state of fibre infrastructure, which remains inadequate in the country, is also seen as another major challenge that may hinder deployment.
   
These gaps were identified by the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), in Lagos, yesterday, at the on-going Social Media Week (SMW) 2020. The Commission subsequently called on the Federal Government to prioritise adequate infrastructure for power generation and distribution.The Guardian checks showed that Nigeria’s installed capacity is about 12,500 Megawatts (MW), but is only able to produce 7,000 MW, while less than 4,000 MW is shared among the over 180 million people living in the country.
   
As such, NCC warned that something urgent needed to be done to fix the power sector; else, 5G commercialisation would be seriously threatened.Speaking on: “5G Network Deployment: Social Economic Benefits and Challenges,” the Director, Technical Standard and Network Integrity, NCC, Bako Wakil, said 5G is a clear departure from 3G and 4G networks. Wakil said 5G also known as IMT 2020 has been designed with huge capability and requirements for today and future need.
