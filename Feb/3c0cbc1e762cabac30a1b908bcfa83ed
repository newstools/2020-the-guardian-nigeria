• Neighbouring countries yet to comply with trade protocols
Expectations that the land borders may be reopened anytime soon should be shelved, as Federal Government, through the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), has said it will sustain the ongoing drill till the desired goals are achieved, despite prayers by some manufacturers and businesses for concessions over goods stuck at the borders.
  
While farmers craved that the borders remained shut for as long as possible to continue to enjoy the monopoly in the local markets despite supply gaps, the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN), said the negative effect of the closure is far-reaching, and would linger even after the borders are reopened.
 
Similarly, the operators raised concerns about the continued border closure for the implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), expected to kick off in July.  Mabogunje added, “On positives, we have seen appreciable increase in domestic rice and poultry product production. Fuel smuggling to neighbouring countries has reduced. The directive paid off for the Nigerian Customs Service, as revenue generated by the agency increased to ₦1.34trillion in 2019 from ₦1.2trillion in 2018.
