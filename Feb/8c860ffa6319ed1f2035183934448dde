Nasarawa United Football Club has pulled out of the Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) 2019/2020 season relegation zone after defeating Enugu Rangers a 2-1 in one of the outstanding games played yesterday. The NPFL rescheduled Matchday 14 fixture was played at the Lafia Township Stadium. The victory did not come easy as the home team and supporters were shocked by an early Rangers’ goal through Israel Abia, who slotted in an excellent free-kick at the edge of the Nasarawa United 18 yard box in the third minute. Nasarawa United quickly rallied together, piling pressure on the away team and in the sixth minute were awarded a penalty kick for a foul on Chinedu Ohanachom. Abubakar Lawal stepped up to convert the penalty kick to make it 1-1 and change the mood at the Lafia Township Stadium. In the second half, the Nasarawa United attack mounted series of pressure and continued to slice the Rangers’ defence apart with creative passes and unique team work, which got them the breakthrough in the 52nd minute through Abdullahi Abubakar. The striker slotted in the rebound after the Rangers’ goalkeeper had parried the ball towards him. After the game, Chairman of Nasarawa United, Isaac Danladi was joyful over the victory that took the team out of the relegation zone. “There is still a lot to be done. Yes, we are temporarily out of the relegation zone but by the special grace of God, in some few week’s time, we will be fully out of it,” he said. The victory has placed Nasarawa United in the 13th position on the NPFL table. They will travel to Bauchi State at the weekend to face Wikki Tourists.
