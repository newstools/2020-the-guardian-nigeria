The Vice Chancellor (VC), Michael Okpara University of Agriculture Umudike (MOUAU), Abia State, Prof. Francis Otunta, yesterday, said that the nation’s problems have been compounded by those who hold and flaunt various university degrees but have no character, saying that a country with such people in the majority cannot make appropriate progress. Speaking at the institution’s 27th matriculation ceremony, where about 3, 532 fresh students were formally admitted into its full time undergraduate, graduate and part time programmes, the VC said that the university has no intention of contributing to this stock of potential leaders but rather is in the vanguard for a better Nigeria and a better tomorrow. Otunta said MOUAU is rapidly evolving as a centre of excellence where training, research and community service for the achievement of national development goals and global relevance, are emphasised in an atmosphere that promotes social cohesion and responsible citizenship. He tasked the students to conduct themselves with decency and comportment as responsible members of the university community. He assured them of the management’s commitment to giving students sound and functional education that will make them worthy and confident professionals well prepared for the global society and fully adapted to the demands of a technologically advancing world.
