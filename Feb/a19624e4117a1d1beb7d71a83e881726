Worried about the rising security challenges in the country and threat to lives and property, as well as abuse of illicit drugs,  officials of the Performing Musicians Association of Nigeria (PMAN) has taken the campaign to end the menace to security agencies in Kaduna. The executive members of PMAN, led by its President, Hajiya Amina Dangaji, paid courtesy visits to the General Commanding Officer (GOC) of First Mechanised  Division of the Nigerian Army and Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) and Department of State Services (DSS), urging the security agencies to find lasting solutions to high rate of kidnappings, banditry and other recurring crimes in the state and Nigeria in general. In her separate speeches during the “Save Nigeria” campaign tour to the security agencies in Kaduna, the PMAN President said that the decision to come out and lend their voice to the call for action against the killings, attacks and violence was out of concern and worry over the nation’s security challenges. According to her, the performing musicians strongly believe in the power of music as uniting factor and platform that could help build peace and change mindsets of the perpetrators of the heinous crimes.She said: “We have decided to collaborate with the security agencies across the country to produce messages of peace and awareness campaign for drug abuse and Lassa fever outbreak. “For us at PMAN, every life is important and must be protected against hoodlums and miscreants, who hide under different kinds of sentiments to kill innocent souls.”While urging the Federal Government to rise up and renew commitment to fighting poverty and unemployment, which according to her, are the causative agents of crimes and restiveness, she pointed out that the most important responsibility of government as stipulated in the Constitution is to provide security and ensure welfare of the citizens, adding: “As you all know, music is a message that every tribe sings whether Hausa, Igbo or Yoruba. It is a global language and with music, we can send message of peace down the global world. “We decided to go round and lend our voices to fight against drug abuse. We talked about drug abuse on the youths and peace in the nation and parental care and where there is no good relationship between parents and children, there will be abuse. “Most of the criminals we see on the streets are not only poor men’s children but some of them are of the rich who could not accommodate or tolerate their children’s attitude and instead of them to find solution to it, they would rather allow such  children to go to the streets and cause instability in the community. Our mission here is to build a good relationship in your organisations.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
