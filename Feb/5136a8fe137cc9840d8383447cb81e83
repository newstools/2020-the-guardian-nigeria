 A  bus is pictured in Luxembourg as the country inaugurates its free public transports policy on February 29, 2020. – Luxembourg has become the first country in the world on February 29, 2020 to offer a free public transport system as the government tries to reduce particularly dense car traffic. Some cities have already taken similar partial measures but the transport ministry said it was the first time such a decision would cover an entire country.

But the transport ministry said it was the first time such a decision covered an entire country. The free transport, flagged as “an important social measure”, affects approximately 40 percent of households and is estimated to save each one around 100 euros ($110) per year. Not all passengers were aware of the change, which was brought forward one day ahead of schedule. “It’s free? I didn’t know,” said a woman in her 50s who gave her first name as Dominique as she waited at Luxembourg’s main train station.

The measure is part of a plan intended to reduce congestion. Private cars are the most used means of transport in the Grand Duchy, accounting for 47 percent of business travel and 71 percent of leisure transport. With more than 200,000 people living in neighbouring France, Germany and Belgium who work in Luxembourg and most of them driving in, that makes for major traffic jams at peak hours. The population of the tiny country is just 610,000 and those cross-border workers account for half the total employees. The capital city of Luxembourg has invested in its public transport network, notably by building a tram network, but commuters complain it is still patchy. It will be some years before the network links to the northern airport, for instance. “There’s been an enormous delay to the development of public transport,” said Blanche Weber, head of the Luxembourg Ecological Movement pressing for better links on environmental grounds. “Systematic and continuous investment is a sine qua non (essential) condition for promoting the attractiveness of public transport,” admitted transport minister Francois Bausch. Sales of tickets on the domestic network — which cost two euros per journey — previously covered just eight percent of the 500-million-euro cost of running the transport system. That shortfall will now be met from the treasury. Ticket machines are to be gradually removed from stations, but offices selling tickets for international train trips and for first-class seating in Luxembourg — which continues to be a paying service — will remain.
