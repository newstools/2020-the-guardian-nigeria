A detained policeman, simply identified as Eze, has committed suicide at the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department (SCIID), Panti in Yaba, Lagos State. The policeman, who was attached to the Dangote factory, had allegedly shot dead a young man, prompting his arrest and detention at SCIID cell.
 
The murder case against Eze was still been investigated at the Homicide Section of SCIID, before he hanged himself in the early hours of Wednesday.
 
A source at SCIID said Eze hanged himself in a secluded part of the cell. “It was his cellmates who woke up this morning and saw his dead body that started shouting. It was obvious he made sure all his cellmates were asleep before taking the drastic step,” the source said.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
