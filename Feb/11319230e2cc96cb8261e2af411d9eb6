Adrien Rabiot starts in the Juventus midfield in their Champions League last-16 first leg against Lyon in his native France on Wednesday, as both Aaron Ramsey and Blaise Matuidi are left on the bench at kick-off. Cristiano Ronaldo is joined in the Italian champions’ attack by Juan Cuadrado and Paulo Dybala, with Gonzalo Higuain a substitute. Ronaldo, who recently turned 35, has scored in each of his nine appearances for Juve in 2020 and has netted 19 goals since the beginning of December. Meanwhile, Lyon coach Rudi Garcia has handed a Champions League debut to Brazilian midfielder Bruno Guimaraes, a January signing from Athletico Paranaense. French international Leo Dubois will also play at right-back in a 3-5-2 formation having recovered from injury. Juventus are heavy favourites to beat a Lyon side struggling in seventh place in France’s top flight and who are without their star player and captain, Memphis Depay, due to a long-term knee injury.
