• Vows to resist imposition of candidate outside state Chairman, Ekiti State Chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Paul Omotoso, has described as untrue reports that the former Governor of Oyo State, Senator Abiola Ajimobi, has been endorsed as the next Deputy National Chairman (South) of the party. In a statement made available to newsmen in Ado-Ekiti by the state APC Director of Media and Publicity, Sam Oluwalana, on behalf of the state chairman yesterday, he said the meeting held at Osogbo, the Osun State capital, did not make mention of any endorsement. The statement read: “I was present at the meeting and nobody said anything about endorsing anybody for the position at that meeting.
“We made our position clear that our state has to serve out its tenure and that we are endorsing Senator Gbenga Aluko for the position. “The South-West Chairman of the party, Pastor Bankole Oluwajana, received a petition which we submitted at the meeting and promised to forward same to the national secretariat of the party. That was all that transpired at the meeting. For anybody to say or report anything to the contrary is not only false, but pure mischief,” he said. The Ekiti State chapter of the party, however, vowed to ensure that its nomination of Aluko to fill the vacancy was respected.It said that going by precedence, the state’s should be the one to occupy the office, which was earlier occupied by the current Minister of Trade and Industry, Otunba Niyi Adebayo.
