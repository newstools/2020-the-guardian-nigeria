Indices plunge by 1.11% in five trading days
For the third consecutive week, weak sentiments have continued to dominate the domestic equities market, as investors lose 1.11 per cent. Specifically, the All-Share index and market capitalisation of the bourse depreciated 1.11 per cent to close the week at 27,755.87 points and N14.456 trillion respectively. All other indices finished lower with the exception of NSE AFR Div Yield and NSE Industrial Goods indices, which appreciated by 0.11 per cent and 0.78 per cent respectively, while NSE ASeM Index closed flat. The NSE has suffered from the twin effects of Monetary policy tightening through last month’s upward adjustment of the Cash Reserve Requirements (CRR) by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), just as the directive that companies file their Q4 financials has deflated speculative trading in the new year. This, in addition to the rising insecurity, slow economic rebound, resulted to massive selloffs as witnessed at the beginning of the week. The new pattern of reporting triggered selloff, as the Q4 numbers came without corporate actions because they are unaudited. Analysts argued that the prevailing low trades and activities on the exchange are a clear reflection of indecision among traders and investors as the market searches for direction after the adjustment of Cash Reserve Requirements of banks triggered outflow from the stock market. The decline was despite the fact that Nigerian Breweries filed its full-year audited report with the directors offering a final dividend of N1.51 per share. Analysts at Codros Capital said: “In our view, the trend witnessed last week is likely to persist, as weakening market sentiment and the absence of positive catalysts are expected to pressure market returns. Nonetheless, we advise investors to take positions in fundamentally justified stocks.” The Chief  Research Officer of Investdata Consulting Limited, Ambrose Omordion said: “We expect the market to sustain its reversal as the index remains between 50 per cent and 61.8 per cent Fibonacci retracement ahead of more audited earnings hitting the market any moment. “Despite the likely continuation of the mixed intraday movement in the midst of profit-taking, with investors buying increasing position ahead of dividend news. “This is also against the backdrop of the fact that the capital wave in the financial market may persist in the midst of relatively low-interest rates in the money market, high inflation and unstable economic outlook for 2020. “Moreso,  investors and traders are positioning in anticipation of the 2019 full-year earnings reports, amidst the changing sentiments in the hope of improved liquidity and positive economic indices which may reverse the current trend.” Further breakdown of last week’s trading dictated that a total  of 912.175 million shares worth N12.126 billion in 17,083 deals were recorded  by investors on the floor of the exchange, in contrast to a total of 1.478 billion shares valued at N20.295 billion that was exchanged in 23,263 deals during the preceding week.
