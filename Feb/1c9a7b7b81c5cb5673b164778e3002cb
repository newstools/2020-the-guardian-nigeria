Match promoter The Fasta had run adverts heavily featuring the Portuguese striker. Tickets — priced from 30,000 won ($25) to 400,000 won — sold out in less than three minutes, with many eager to see the 34-year-old superstar in action. Two fans sued The Fasta, accusing it of false advertising, and the Incheon District Court ruled the promoter should pay them 371,000 won each, the South’s Yonhap news agency reported. No order was made against Ronaldo or his club. South Korean fans’ frustration has led to the coining of an online phrase, “acting like Ronaldo”, to criticise someone who only seeks benefits without fulfilling promised action. “If he had played just for 10 minutes, everyone would have walked home happy,” one user wrote on the country’s largest portal site Naver.
