The Office of the Surveyor-General of the Federation (OSGOF) has awarded various gifts to its sportsmen and women, who won medals at the Federal Public Service Games (FEPSGA) held in Lafia, Nasarawa State.
 
The Surveyor General of the Federation, Taiwo S. Adeniran, who spoke yesterday in Abuja, said sports should be taken as a way of life for workers, especially to stay healthy and contribute usefully to the economy.
 
He also urged the directors and staff of OSGOF to henceforth take sports seriously and participate in the monthly keep fit activities being encouraged by the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation.  Earlier, the National President of FEPSGA, Mr. Aloku Amaebi said efforts were being made to see that the competition would produce athletes for Nigeria just like the Military and Para-Military organs.
 
The Director, Human Resource Management, Mr. Igbokwe Felix Onyehira said the feat achieved by the sportsmen came with a huge sacrifice, adding, “we have to celebrate to encourage them for future games.”
 
Acting Team Manager, Yusuf Maisamari explained that 33 persons from OSGOF featured in the 2019 FEPSGA, returning with 14 medals, unlike the 2016 event where only 10 went and came back with three medals. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
