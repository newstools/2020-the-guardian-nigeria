The Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS), in collaboration with the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs, is holding discussions on visa issuance and processes with a view to looking into the principle guiding reciprocity as a way of enhancing international relations. The service’s Comptroller General, Muhammad Babandede, said one of the keys to effective implementation of Nigeria’s visa 2020 was making reciprocal considerations to the international community and providing a global system that takes care of the concerns of Nigerians and the prosperity of the nation.
