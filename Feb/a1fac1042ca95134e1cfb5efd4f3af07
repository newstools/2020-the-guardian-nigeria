Bayern is a point ahead of second-placed RB Leipzig in the league table and has nine wins and a draw in their last 10 games in all competitions. However, with one eye on Chelsea, Flick wants Bayern to play well in both halves, especially after recent nervy wins over Hoffenheim and Cologne, who came back in the game after Bayern had built up a big lead. “Sometimes I would like us to be a little more clever,” Flick added. The 54-year-old has been in charge in a caretaker capacity since Niko Kovac was sacked in November but remains relaxed about his future. “My world won’t end,” Flick said should Bayern opt for another head coach for 2020/21. “It’s just important that we have a successful season.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
