They have drawn their last four Premier League matches, with their last league win coming against Manchester United on New Years Day. Arsenal is currently 10 points adrift of the Champions League places but Arteta said his aim was to get the Gunners back among European football’s elite clubs. “I want to go game by game,” he said. “At the moment we are far from it, but there are a lot of games to play.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
