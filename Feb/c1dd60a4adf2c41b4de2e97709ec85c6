With the removal of multiple tax footprints from securities lending and real estate investment schemes in the new Finance Act 2019, stockbrokers yesterday, stressed the need for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), to update existing rules consistent with the law to enable operators to unlock value in both sectors to deepen the market.
 
Securities lending is the act of loaning a stock, derivative or other security to an investor or firm. This requires the borrower to put up collateral, whether cash, security or a letter of credit.
  
The Vice-Chairman, Highcap Securities Limited, David Adonri, said: “Now that some of the impediments to investments in these sectors have been removed, SEC should take a look at the new Finance Act and compare it with the existing rules on securities lending to see whether there is an area that calls for harmonisation.”  “The NSE, in its efforts to support the growth of the Nigerian economy and its issuers is, therefore, happy to collaborate with leading tax expert, KPMG to highlight the implications of these new rules and provide guidance on how to effectively navigate the provisions of the bill, especially as it relates to taxes.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
