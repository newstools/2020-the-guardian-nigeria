The Nigeria Wrestling Federation (NWF) will tomorrow begin camping in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State, ahead of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics Africa/Oceania qualifiers, holding in El Jadida City, Morocco between March 13th and 15th. According to NWF President, Daniel Igali, 10 wrestlers in the male and female categories who took part at the just ended African Championships in Algiers, Algeria and gave good account of themselves alongside their sparring partners, are expected at the camp in Yenagoa to intensify training before the final selection for the qualifiers and then depart for Morocco. He said at the camping exercise will be coaches Purity Akuh, Victor Kodei, Joe Oziti and Happiness Burutu, who will guide the wrestlers. The NWF warned that selection of athletes for the Olympics Africa/Oceania qualifiers in Morocco would be on merit only, adding that all invited athletes with their sparring partners are expected in Yenagoa latest today and to start training tomorrow. “Seriousness in training, determination and strong desire to compete are some of the criteria that will be used to choose who makes the team to Morocco,” he stated, adding that he was sure six other athletes would join Odunayo Adekuoroye as eventual qualifiers to represent Nigeria in the wrestling event at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics in Japan. It will be recalled that world bronze medalist, Adekuoroye, secured her qualification for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics after her bronze medal winning effort at the World Championships in Kazakhstan last year. That was her third medal at the world stage. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
