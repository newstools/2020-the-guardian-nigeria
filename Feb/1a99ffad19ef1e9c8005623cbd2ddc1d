Analysts and operators linked the high selling pressure during the week to prevailing weak investors’ sentiments, high inflation and unstable economic outlook for 2020, while expressing optimism of market rebound with the release of the 2019 full-year earnings. Therefore, they urged investors to take a position in stocks with good fundamentals. Specifically, the Chief Research Officer of Investdata Consulting Limited, Ambrose Omordion, said: “The changing wave and thinking in the nation’s financial market also call for a change in investment strategies and portfolio rebalancing, at a time many investible funds are lying idle at a time of rising inflation. He continued: “It is long established that under this circumstance, investors can only hedge by investing in dividend-paying stocks, especially now that earnings season has commenced. “Market recovery will continue when the 2019 full-year audited results release season fully takes off. “Before now, we noted that, despite the correction, a good number of listed equities did not follow the NSEASI movement pattern and trend as accumulation continues in stocks with high dividend expectations. “We, therefore, advise investors to take advantage of low-priced equities as an intelligent investment strategy. Such equities should be selected after establishing the possibility of receiving cash dividends when the result is out.”
Analysts at Codros Securities Limited said: “Amidst continued weak market sentiments, we advise investors to trade cautiously, taking positions in fundamentally justified stocks.” Further analysis of last week’s trading indicated that a turnover of 1.499 billion shares worth N17.907billion was recorded in 18,515 deals by investors on the floor of the Exchange.
