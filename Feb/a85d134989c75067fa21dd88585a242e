Sarz has produced ingenious sounds for some of the biggest artists in Nigeria, Africa, and the world at large, which turned out to be the rave of the moment. After taking his time climbing up the ranks, the multi-talented producer is concerned with continuity and leaving a lasting imprint in more ways than one. Speaking on the idea behind releasing the sound pack, the 30-year-old said, “Afrobeats consumption is on an all-time high. So, there are more creatives around the world that want to get their hands on the genre. My sound pack is a great source of inspiration for Afrobeat producers and any genre in general.” He continued: “I’m so eager to hear what people come up with. This is content that creatives need. I don’t think it will be under-utilized because there will be someone out there that will create a hit off it.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
