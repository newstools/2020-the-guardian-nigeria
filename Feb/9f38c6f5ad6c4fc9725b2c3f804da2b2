Some youths suspected to be loyalists of the state government, yesterday, booed the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, at the airport in Benin City, Edo State. The youths stormed the Benin Airport entrance and chanted anti-Oshiomhole songs despite the presence of security personnel. It was gathered that Dr Pius Odubu, General Charles Airhiavbere, Samson Osagie and other APC chieftains loyal to Oshiomhole were at the airport to receive him when the incident happened. Two police vehicles and an armoured personnel carrier were stationed at various points of the airport while officials of the Department of State Security and the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps were also on ground at the airport in the melee. Meanwhile, the Edo State government said it had nothing to do with the booing of Comrade Oshiomhole. A statement by Special Adviser to the Governor on Media and Communication Strategy, Mr. Crusoe Osagie, said the government had no connection with the crowd that was reported to have booed Comrade Oshiomhole. “The series of anti-Oshiomhole protests across the country in the last couple of days, including those who jeered and booed Comrade Oshiomhole in Benin City on Saturday, have nothing to do with the government in Edo State,” the statement added.
