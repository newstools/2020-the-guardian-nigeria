The suspected suicide bomber had parked a car at the church premises with explosives programmed to go off at the end of the service. This left many people surprised, angry and questioning the motifs behind his action. Below are some reactions to this news: So…Today is Nathaniel Samuel trying to bomb a church in Kaduna!!  Last last Terrorism doesn’t have Religion. Boko Haram does not represent any Religion. — MAJ (@maryam_Jidayi) February 2, 2020  NATHANIEL Samuel, the Christian young man caught with explosives trying to bomb the LIVING FAITH CHURCH, in KADUNA isn’t the first Christian arrested while trying to bomb churches. In February 2012, nine Christians were arrested in Bauchi trying to bomb a COCIN church. pic.twitter.com/C2DzGQcJ8U — Abubakar Hidima, Ph.D. (@Realoilsheikh) February 3, 2020  Nathaniel Samuel was caught with an explosive device trying to bomb Living Faith church in Kaduna. If he wasn’t caught, and if the bomb was detonated, the wrong people will be blamed. pic.twitter.com/0dBQ8R68zQ — Kwankwason Tuwita (@baba__________) February 2, 2020  NATHANIEL Samuel,

May God help our govt and Nation to overcome these evil men. pic.twitter.com/ExC4RLKdOr — GENERAL CBN Gov Akinsola Ak (@cbngov_akin1) February 3, 2020  One Nathaniel Samuel arrested in Kaduna trying to set off explosive materials at Living Faith Church, Sabon Tasha Kaduna. The bad guys are back trying to ignite an inter-religious war in #Nigeria. May God continue expose them and their evil plots. Amen.

It’ll be intelligent to know that Terrorism and insurgency have absolutely no basis in any religion as this case and many others have proven but an unprecedented attack — Shamaki Rimam-amam (@Shamakey_) February 3, 2020
