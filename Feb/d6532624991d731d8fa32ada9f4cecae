The Chairman of sacked ALGON, Oyo State chapter, Prince Ayodeji Abass-Alesinloye has condemned the return of brigandage to the state, disrupting the peaceful atmosphere, foundation of which was laid by the administration of former governor, Senator Abiola Ajimobi. Abass-Alesinloye who is of chairman of Oluyole Local Government expressed this sadness while alleging that those that invaded some local government headquarters are believed to be loyal to the Peoples Democratic Party  (PDP). In a statement made available to journalists in Ibadan yesterday, Abass-Alesinloye said:”Earlier today, PDP thugs had unleashed violence in local government headquarters in Ibarapa East, Saki West, Atisbo, Ibadan North East ,Ido, Ogo Oluwa, Surulere South  and Ibadan South East local government areas even with the heavy presence of the Police who seemed helpless as the mayhem continued “It would be recalled that the governor of Oyo state, Engr Seyi Makinde had met with the Caretaker chairmen yesterday where he assured them of their right to occupy the local councils, having said that he did not meet democratically elected chairmen in office when he took over governance. The governor was alleged to have doled out a sum of N3.5 million to each of the caretaker chairmen to mobilize their people in readiness for their return to the local councils today. “The Governor was also said to have held a private meeting with an official of the Oyo State branch of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW), Alhaji Lamidi Mukaila popularly known as Auxiliary who recently regained freedom from prisons over a charge of murder, where the NURTW chieftain was given an undisclosed amount of money as mobilization for today’s event”. Prince Ayodeji Abass-Alesinloye described the alleged invasion of local councils as the height of executive recklessness by Governor Makinde while advising the governor to live true to his responsibility as the chief security officer of the state by respecting the rule of law as pronounced by the Supreme Court on the local government administration.He added: “It is quite unfortunate that the Governor is now the one promoting chaos with his support for this illegality.” “The ALGON chairman however urged men of the Nigerian Police Force and other security operatives to live up to their responsibility by reining in the political thugs causing mayhem in the State. “Our fight is legitimate. The Supreme Court has ruled on this that no Governor has the right to dissolve democratically elected local government administration. The constitution is also clear on this”. Abass- Aleshinloye also warned against the alleged continued tampering of the finances of Local Councils as being done by the Caretaker chairmen. “ Let me sound a note of warning for the umpteenth time. Tampering with finances of Local government by Caretaker chairmen is the height of illegality. The law will take its course on any of them who does that. We have written to banks on this and we do not expect the banks to be complicity in this illegality “, he said. Reacting, the Oyo State Police Command through the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Olugbenga Fadeyi said police officers were deployed strategically to carry out their responsibilities. He said: “I don’t know about that one. What I know is that there is a massive deployment of police personnel across all the local government areas even from 5.00 this morning (Friday). A police personnel is there strategically for law and order. We will continue to carry out our constitutional responsibility of protection of lives and property, prevention of offenders and hoodlums that want to cause problems in any area. Our men are there strategically carrying out their responsibility”. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
