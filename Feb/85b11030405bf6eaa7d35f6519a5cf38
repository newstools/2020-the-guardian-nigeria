There is no silver lining to sweat stains (more like gold-ish). Not only is a sweaty underarm embarrassing but it can also derail your social life. Since you don’t want sweat stains to ruin that favourite shirt or dress, the best way to beat pit stains is to avoid them. These tips below will help you prevent sweat stains from occurring. Wear a cheap undershirt To avoid sweat stains on your favourite clothes, ensure you wear an undershirt to absorb the stain. For fitted and tailored shirts, use sweat pads or sweat guards. Trim the armpit hair Armpit hair collects excess sweat, dirt and bacteria causing sweat stains. You can prevent the sweat stains and odour causing bacteria by trimming your armpit hair. Take it easy with the deodorant Just like some antiperspirants, deodorant can cause stains on your shirt. Apply lightly and allow it to dry before dressing. Make strong antiperspirant your best friend Apply a strong antiperspirant before bedtime and always allow it dry before getting dressed. A strong antiperspirant can prevent bacteria-prone sweat from staining your shirts. Wash sweaty shirts immediately Don’t leave a sweaty shirt to dry before washing as the longer you leave a sweaty shirt, the stronger the stain sets in. Hand wash sweaty clothes with a bit more detergent and cold water to get rid of the stain.
