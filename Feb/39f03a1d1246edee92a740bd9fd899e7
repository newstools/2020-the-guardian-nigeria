According to the NESG Board of Directors, 10 out of the 46 sectors in the economy, which contributed approximately 27.1 per cent of the output, contracted in 2019. A sectoral review showed that the Agriculture Sector continues to grow slowly. Whilst the Service sectors, at 53 per cent remained the largest contributor to the output, growth in these sectors is adversely affected by rising incidences of insecurity and continuing closure of Nigeria’s land borders.  Given the fall in oil prices and expectation that oil prices will continue to ease, NESG advised that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) considers managing the Naira by allowing the currency to fluctuate within a pre-determined range not exceeding five per cent. Such fluctuation will serve to reduce the net outflow of reserves by improving confidence in the economy. The outlook for the global economy is beclouded by the Coronavirus outbreak in China. As a threat to public health, NESG noted that the World Health Organisation (WHO), has listed Nigeria along with 13 other African countries as nations where an outbreak of the Coronavirus is possible. Given the increasingly close economic links with China, it is imperative for Nigeria to upgrade national preventative readiness, and ensure adequate capacity to isolate any infected entrants into the country. It is also important for public policy to note the adverse effect of the Coronavirus on global economic growth, especially commodity prices, and adjust to ameliorate these adverse effects.
