All is set for the swearing-in of the People Democratic Party's Senator Douye Diri as the governor of Bayelsa State. The swearing-in is slated for Government House, Yenagoa on Friday. Diri will succeed the outgoing governor Seriake Dickson after the inauguration. Diri benefitted from the Supreme Court sacking of erstwhile governor-elect David Lyon on Thursday, February 13.  Lyon was supposed to be sworn in today until he was sacked by the court. The court said Biobarakuma Degi-Eremienyo, who was Lyon’s running mate in the election, forged the certificate he presented to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). The five-man panel of the Supreme Court led by Justice Mary Peter-Odili ordered INEC to withdraw the certificate of return issued to Lyon and present it to Diri. INEC has issued the certificate of return to Diri and his deputy-elect Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo after INEC chairman Mahmood Yakubu declared the candidate of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate as the winner of the election. Yakubu said the declaration was “In compliance with the orders of the Supreme Court, the Commission met this morning and reviewed the result of the election in which 45 political parties contested.” Diri's declaration as winner of the election has been greeted with protests by members of the All Progressives Congress (APC).
