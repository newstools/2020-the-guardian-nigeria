Speaker of Imo State House of Assembly, Chiji Collins has demised the media report that he left the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the All Progressives Congress to retain his position under the new government. Speaking in a recent APC stakeholders meeting held at Isiala Mbano council area, Chiji said he joined the APC because he would not want to be an opposition Speaker in the state. Collins said he still enjoys a cordial relationship with former Governor, Emeka Ihedioha and other chieftains of the party in the state and beyond. The Speaker, however, expressed regret on how his former party, PDP lost control of the House following the massive defection of over 15 other lawmakers to the ruling party in the state. He reiterated his support to the incumbent governor, Hope Uzodinma, and assured him on his commitment to use his office to facilitate good legislations and attract good democratic dividends for the overall good of the people. Chiji won the assembly seat on the platform of the All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA) but joined PDP prior to the contest of the speakership position. Barely two weeks after the Supreme Court ousted Ihedioha and installed Uzodinma, he left the party alongside other PDP lawmakers for APC.
