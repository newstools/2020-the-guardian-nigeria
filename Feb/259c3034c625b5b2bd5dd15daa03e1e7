“Economies of the New Decade – The Winning Agenda,” Netufo, said the church understand that it is not only prayer, but having a means of livelihood that can make a way for people. “We have come to the realisation that there are opportunities available that people can key into and make a living from, and this is the reason we are targeting both the old and young in this maiden empowerment programme, as we know that poverty does not discriminate between old and young, neither does it have a boundary,” he said. He described the summit as an eye opener, which would give participants the needed turnaround, by equipping them with the knowledge of how to go about sustainable living. The guest speaker, Dr. Biodun Adedipe, an economist, said Nigerians should begin to change the narrative, and see the many opportunities that are abound within the country’s large population of 200 million people. He noted that the large population itself is an advantage as people would naturally need basic things of life, such as housing, clothing, food among others. “All Nigerians need is to be creative, produce quality materials that would solve people’s problem,” he said. Adedipe who encouraged local production, said if Nigerians can conceive ideas and go into production, it would go a long way in solving unemployment.
