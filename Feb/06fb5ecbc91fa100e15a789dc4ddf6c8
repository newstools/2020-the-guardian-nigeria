 Senior Brand Manager, Heineken, Olaoluwa Babalola, the Portfolio Manager, International Premium Lager, Sarah Agha, and the National Key Account Manager, Nigerian Breweries Plc, Okwudili Nwakobi during the launch of the ‘Better Together’ campaign in Lagos…yesterday.  To make the matches more exciting for Nigerians, sponsors of the competition, Heineken launched its “Better Together” campaign yesterday as follow up to last year’s hugely successful Unmissable campaign. At a ceremony watched by football buffs, journalists and retired footballers, among others, Heineken said the campaign is aimed at fostering conviviality and togetherness amongst football lovers. Speaking on the campaign was the Portfolio Manager, International Premium Lager, Nigerian Breweries, Sarah Agha, who noted, “Heineken is once again excited to deliver the better together experience to lovers of the game. The Champions League is the most coveted trophy by top European teams and their fans. Heineken has provided a platform to create and share experiences as these teams and their supporters pave their way to European glory. We have exciting plans for our fans this year, and we can’t wait to get started.” She revealed that this year, fans could expect the same level of excitement as Heineken intended to not only sponsor the games but also creatively execute a slate of events to reward consumers’ passion for the beautiful game. “All Champions League matches will be aired live at the prestigious Heineken House as well as other match viewing centres across the country. The brand also promises to reward some lucky fans with the chance to travel to see the final match live in Istanbul on May 30,” she added.
