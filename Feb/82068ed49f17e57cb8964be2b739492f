To combat the high rate of crime and suicide in the country, calls have been made to the youths to be innovative and creative to survive the trying times. This call was made yesterday by the convener of Harvesters Entrepreneurs Forum, Pastor Bolaji Idowu, at a programme to herald the annual economic meeting tagged: “Re-imagining Africa’s path to prosperity through innovation,” in Lagos. He added that it was time Nigerians starts thinking about what to do for the country as patriotic citizens even as he urged the government to inspire hope in the people so the country can be a better place. He also urged parents to desist from supporting their wards who engage in criminal activities, warning that it could lead to untimely death. He said: “Anytime there is oppression from the economy, it gives rise to innovative way of thinking. It might be entrepreneurship. Okada was in vogue because there was car traffic and now that the government has restricted it, I am sure something will come up. When there is hardship or limitation, people become very creative on what to do next.” He added that the event, which would start tomorrow, Saturday, would serve as an avenue to train participants to start businesses in which they can provide for themselves. “The forum is a platform for Nigerian business persons to learn from the failures and successes of already successful entrepreneurs, giving them a better shot at making their own businesses successful. We will give them skill and provide them with mentors and soft loans to help them move to the next level.” He added that the programme would hold in four different locations: Gbagada, Lekki, Ikeja and Anthony; and will have the CEO of Access Bank, Herbert Wigwe, GMB Interswitch, Mitchell Elegbe and Co-founder Piggyvest, Odun Eweniyi and others as speakers.
