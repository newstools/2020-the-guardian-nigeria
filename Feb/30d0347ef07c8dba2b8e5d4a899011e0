He said the government would intensify screening at points of entry to prevent further importation of the virus. “We will follow WHO guidelines because stopping international travel can backfire. So, as long as we can control it, we do not need to overreact, we are working with WHO. “I only advise people to keep a social distance from people coughing and sneezing and observe respiratory hygiene,” he said. He explained that as part of efforts to tighten response, the Federal Government had increased reagents for testing so that it would not run short of the testing kit. The minister assured that there would be no shortage of the testing reagent and face masks in the county as necessary stakeholders had been contacted for its production. He also said that the four laboratories across the country have full capacity to respond to the virus. He recalled that Nigeria had already obtained the treatment protocol from China, which was used to treat over 5,000 patients in that country. Ehanire said that Nigeria would continue working with the WHO, while training and capacity building was ongoing to tackle the virus. The minister, who said that the identity of the patient from Italy would not be made public without his permission, noted that the Nigeria case is the third Covid-19 in Africa after Egypt and Algeria. It is reported that over  83,000 people in at least 53 countries have been infected and more than 2,800 have died.
