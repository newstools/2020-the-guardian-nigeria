PHOTO: Forbes Cyber security experts have advised people to avoid using public charging stations because scammers are gaining access to download malware to phones, causing them to run slow or lose battery life more quickly. It’s referred to as “juice jacking”, and described as clear and present danger. The most vulnerable are public charging stations on the roadside, malls, hotels, and airports. According to Sisak, “juice jacking” is a USB charging scam where criminals load dangerous software onto the public stations or cables that are used to plug in phones. Within minutes of “juicing” or charging a phone, the malware can cause unsuspecting owners to have their devices “jacked,” which means they could be locked or have their private data and passwords released to the scammer. “Hackers and scam artists have found a way to upload malware into those charging stations, that when you plug the phone in it very well could download a malware into your phone,” said Kelvin Collins with the BBB of Central Georgia. Collins said the way to combat this is to simply bring your own brick charger with the cord. Cyber security experts also advise that you keep your phone up to date and make sure you’re devices are operating on anti-virus software.
