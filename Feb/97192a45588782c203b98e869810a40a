A faction of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ondo State has rejected the Chairman of the newly-inaugurated APC National Reconciliation Committee, Chief Bisi Akande
The factional leaders, under the aegis of APC Unity Forum, after a meeting in Akure yesterday, alleged that Akande, who is the former Governor of Osun State and the first interim chairman of the party, was working against their interest. The meeting was held in the house of former Deputy Governor and Board of Trustees (BoT) member, Alhaji Ali Olanusi, alongside other leading aspirants in the October 10, 2020 governorship election: Dr. Olusegun Abraham, Bukola Adetula, among others. The meeting decried the replacement of the Senate President with Akande as the chairman of the party’s reconciliation committee and passed vote of no confidence on the former Osun State governor as chairman of the committee. The leaders said that it was earlier agreed that the state party executive should be dissolved but the governor, through some of their leaders, blocked the dissolution that was jointly agreed on in the presence of Senator Bola Ahmed Tinubu. “The Unity Forum for the umpteenth time at the meeting of today reaffirms the stand and the outcome of the July 2019 meeting presided over by our National Leader, Senator Bola Ahmed Tinubu, where it was agreed that the executive of APC from state to ward be dissolved as a prelude to peace and pre-condition for any party primary in Ondo State,” the group said. Meanwhile, the group has also condemned the setting up of an advisory council in the state chapter of the party headed by Chief Pius Akinyelure, having one of the aspirants, Isaac Kekemeke, as the Secretary. It said that the composition of the advisory council did not reflect the real membership spread of the party in the state, lamenting that they are the “yes men”.The aggrieved leaders, who also passed a vote of no confidence on the just-concluded APC primary elections for the upcoming local council chairmanship election, urged the national leadership of the party to do justice first in Ondo APC “instead of searching for peace,” warning that “this is because if justice is done, peace will naturally return, as peace without justice is like a ‘peace of the grave yard.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
