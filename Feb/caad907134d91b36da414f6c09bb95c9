Picks Ndidi as favourite Nigerian player
Former Manchester United stalwart, Rio Ferdinand has expressed doubts on the ability of ex-Super Eagles striker, Odion Ighalo to meet the expectations of the Red Devils. Ferdinand is praying the 30-year-old will bring his best game to the club.
   
The football legend, who said he was concerned by Manchester United’s performance this season, noted that the Chinese League and the English League were miles apart in standard, adding, “International experience is one thing that he can bring. “Ighalo has played in the English Premier League before, but one thing I am concerned about is that he is coming from China… they are trying to build a league there, but the standard is not up to the Premier League,” he said. The international football legend, who is a Guinness global ambassador, Rio Ferdinand described Africans’ knowledge and enthusiasm for football as “crazy.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
