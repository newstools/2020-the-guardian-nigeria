An orphanage home, Du-Merci, yesterday dragged the Kano State Commissioner of Police, and the Commander, National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP) before the Federal High Court sitting in Kano, demanding the court to order the release of 26 orphans evacuated from the home. A joint operatives of Kano police command and NAPTIP had raided the home at Nomansland Sabon in Gari area of Kano on December 25, 2019, arrested the founder of the home, Mr. Solomon Richard Tarfa, and detained 26 orphans under his care. The operatives under the joint operation also raided a similar home belonging to same founder at Kaduna. Tarfa was accused of operating illegal orphanage home in Kano. Counsel to Du-Merci home, Gideon Uzu, had filed a motion on notice February 6, seeking to enforce the fundamental human right of the 26 children as guaranteed by the constitution. Appearing before Justice Sa’adatu Ibrahim Mark, the plaintiff had argued that further detention of the 26 Du-Merci orphans at Kano orphanage centre was a violation of their rights to dignity and decent home, education and worship. The plaintiff’s argument however generated counter objection from the respondents when he (plaintiff) sought to withdraw its initial application and replace it with fresh motion on notice. An orphan who graduated from Du-Merci in 2017, Samuel Tarfa, told The Guardian at the court that the home has successfully nurtured and trained hundreds of the orphans in the last 28 years. Samuel, who regretted the allegation of illegal activities at the home, asked where were those peddling allegations in the last 28 years of its operation.Samuel claimed he had since been adopted by Mr. and Mrs. Tarfa as parents after they had picked him up on the street and nurtured him for 26 years.
