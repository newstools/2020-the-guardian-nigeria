The Nigerian government on Wednesday filed fresh charges against Sahara Reporters publisher Omoyele Sowore. Sowore with his co-defendant Olawale Bakare were at the Abuja high court for the resumed hearing of their trial. The judge Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu adjourned the case till Thursday, February 13 but was told that the attorney-general has taken over the case and filed fresh charges. The prosecutor A.K Alilu informed the court that the office of the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) has taken over the prosecution of the case and has filed fresh and amended charges. Alilu said that they are yet to effect an amendment to charges against the defendants. But the defendants refused to take plea on the new charge filed against them by the Nigerian Government.
