Nigerian UK based R&B singer/songwriter Somadina introduces herself, bringing a new soulful sound to fans with the release of her debut project, Five Stages, which follows her 2019 single Lay low. Five Stages is a 5-track EP which chronicles her experience of loss through the five stages of grief; denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. This art piece spans over meditation songs such as But I should to the resurgent Acapella, a soothing piano ballad with an echo of growth and new life “The EP is a representation of my journey, the good, the bad, and the ugly. Putting this out is honestly the bravest thing I think I have done,” says Somadina. The body of work is a deep, soul-filled, and captivating collection of reminders that it is important to let yourself go through each stage and experience every emotion. “Breakup song ‘IHY’ was a great introduction—a slice of bold R&B-pop that helped earmark the teen singer’s potential. Forthcoming project Five Stages, a loose concept EP centered around the stages of grief, is set to shake up the industry at large.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
