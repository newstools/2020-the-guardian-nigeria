I know everything that happens is never behind Him. I want to say I feel so excited and happy I won my sixth African title. “This will only make me sit up for the Tokyo 2020 Olympic games. It will make me train harder because every eye will be on me now as the number one wrestler in the 57kg,” she said, adding more funds and support would be needed to secure preparatory fights against her opponents before the Olympics. “I will need more financial assistance and some supports in protocols like securing visas to travel for training camps, training competitions and also scouting of some of my strong opponents. These are necessary in order not to hinder my quest for my first medal at the Olympics in Japan,” she stated.
