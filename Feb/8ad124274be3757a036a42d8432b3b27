A twenty-six-year-old member of National Youth Service Corps serving in Kwara State, Oluwatosin Medaiyese, has been taken to an Osogbo Magistrateâ€™s Court in Osun State for allegedly impersonating a judge to fraudulently secure postings for some corps members. The Department of State Services (DSS) in Osun State arraigned Medaiyese yesterday on a one-count charge of impersonation and intent to fraudulently secure Place of Primary Assignment (PPA) postings for his serving colleagues. The DSS prosecution counsel informed the court that the male corps member committed the offence on or before January 30, 2020 in Osogbo. The accused person was said to have falsely represented himself as Justice Aliyu Jimoh to the South-West Zonal Coordinator of the NYSC, Mr. Emmanuel Attah, with the intent of fraudulently using the influence of the judge to secure desired PPAs for some corps members. The DSS said that Medaiyese committed the offence contrary to Section 108 of the Criminal Code Cap 34 Vol. II, Laws of Osun State 2002. Meanwhile, the corps member pleaded not guilty to the charge. His counsel, Mr. Omaniyi Abifarin, urged the court to admit Medaiyese to bail in liberal terms. The defence counsel said the alleged offence against his client was bailable and that the accused person would not abuse the bail if granted because he is currently on a one-year mandatory service with the NYSC in Ilorin, Kwara State. Abifarin assured the court that the accused person would provide reliable surety to stand for his bail and that he would be available to stand his trial. Ruling on the bail application, Magistrate Adebola Ajanaku, who granted the corps member bail in the sum of N100,000 with one surety in the like amount adjourned the case till March 25, 2020, for hearing.
