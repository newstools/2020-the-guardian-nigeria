Nigerian singer Rudeboy of the defunct music duo P-Square has released the official music video to his song “Take It” and his fans are losing their minds with the choice of BBNaija 2019 winner Mercy Eke as the leading lady. The TG Omori directed music video that was released in January this year sees the two stars playing the roles of lovebirds as Rudeboy sings about his love interest taking everything he has so long as she doesn’t break his heart. The music video begins with Rudeboy stepping out of an exotic car as he helps his lady out of the car. They are greeted by the paparazzi and fans wanting to take photos of them. They are on a shopping spree as Mercy picks out expensive fashion items like bags and clothes. Mercy puts her famous sultry body on display in another scene as she strips down to a two-piece bikini and shares a kiss with Rudeboy. She goes on to dance seductively for her man before taking a dip in the pool. The video’s takeaway is about the feeling of being in love and the beauty it has when there is cash to throw around as yet another scene sees Rudeboy buying a car for his lover.
