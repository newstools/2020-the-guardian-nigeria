PrimeAlert, an emergency alert app, which will provide Nigerians with quick emergence response services within a given environment, has been launched. Ibok offiong, chief operating officer, PrimeAlert, said that “The safety app can also be used in a variety of situations when you may need to ask for help or seek assistance from others”, Ms Offiong said. The app, she said, could be useful when involved in an accident, experiencing a serious health problem, fire outbreak and kidnapping. It may also be of help when feeling unsafe, being lost and in other terrible situations, she added. The app works by first installing it on your phone and on your dependants’, she said. “So when you are distress, feel unsafe or in an emergency, the app helps you alert multiple contacts with one simple press of a button”, Ms Offiong said. According to her, the app sends automatic alert via text message to your dependants who may then contact the security agents. The message alert also includes your GPS position and the time sent, she added. She said the Artificial Intelligence feature allows the app to detect when involved in a car crash, gun shot or fire accident and instantly sends rescue alert. “The Artificial Intelligence feature also allows for voice activation. The app recognises pre-stored words or phrases as voice commands. Just repeat the word or phrase during an emergency and the app will instantly send rescue alert”, Effiong said. She said the PrimeAlert app doesn’t require internet data bundle or airtime for MTN and Airtel users. “Other networks are coming soon”, she said.
