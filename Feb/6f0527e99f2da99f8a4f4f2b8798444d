Pentacept Enterprises, a digital marketing agency in Nigeria has partnered Lagos State Polytechnic (LASPOTECH), Isolo Campus to train over 100 students. The digital marketing training was organized by the marketing department, School of Part-time Studies Regular (SPTSR) of LASPOTECH. Speaking at the flag-off of the training, the president of the department, Ms Iyi Esther said, “it is important as students of the marketing department to embrace new forms of marketing that is relevant in workspace. Hence, the need for this training to learn how to get leads, nurture and convert to sales using Facebook and Instagram.” Kehinde Olofintuyi, CEO Pentacept Enterprises ushered the students into a practical session of the training. He urged the student to always be ready to take up new challenges and embrace the required soft skill to perform. “As students, your thought pattern should be channelled towards capacity building beyond the walls of school/campus. “You must be ever ready to constantly take a leap to what is happening in the society now and before you graduate, trying to acquire the requisite skill that can make you employable or toll the path of entrepreneurship as you join the labour market after school,” Mr Olofintiyi added. After the training session, Olofintuyi did a give-away of 20 dollars Ads credit to the two students to set Ads on Facebook for their product. The co-ordinator of the marketing department, Dr W.A Alasiri,  expressed his gratitude to Pentacept Enterprises for the training. He, therefore, employed the students to keep up with the trend in the industry to enhance their knowledge of marketing. Certificates of participation were given to the students.
