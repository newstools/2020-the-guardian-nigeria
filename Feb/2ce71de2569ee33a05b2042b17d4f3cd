Undisclosed bags of Indian hemp (cannabis sativa) exhibits kept at the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) office, Ado Ekiti were yesterday, razed down by fire. The fire incident, which produced thick smoke, was said to have caused discomfort to residents of the area who were made to inhale the substance.  Eyewitness accounts said that the thick smoke led to confusion as several nearby residents scampered for safety. The eyewitness said that some male residents of the area along Akinsola Street, Olorunsogo Quarters, off Iworokoro road, later volunteered to assist the Command with water to put the fire under control before the Ekiti Fire Service arrived. Efforts by newsmen to find out the immediate cause of the fire incident were rebuffed by the agency, as only the fire service men and their fire fighting equipment were allowed into the compound. The Public Relations Officer,Â NDLEA Ekiti Command, Mr. Peter Njokwu, said he had not been briefed on the fire incident.
