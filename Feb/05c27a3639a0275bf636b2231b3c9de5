The wife of Lagos State governor, Dr. Ibijoke Sanwoolu, in conjunction with the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH), has pledged to financially support 15-year-old Mariam Shobukola to get through subsequent stages of her hospital management. Following a gunshot injury that Mariam sustained in her pelvis at Aboru, Iyana Ipaja area of Lagos State on February 5 during a clash between hoodlums and policemen over enforcement of the ban on okada and tricycles in 15 local councils of the state, she had a successful restorative first stage surgery, and will still need another which will be carried out at no cost to the family. Chief Medical Director, LASUTH, Prof. Adetokunbo Fabamwo, reaffirmed this, noting that at times like these, peopleâ€™s compassionate nature must clearly be demonstrated and sacrificial gestures come into play to save lives. He called on well-meaning Nigerians to rise up to the occasion and assuage the suffering of the family.Though Shobukola is recovering well, the second surgery will be carried out at a later time, after full recovery.
