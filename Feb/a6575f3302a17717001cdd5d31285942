Gabriel Jesus started upfront for City in place of Aguero while Nicolas Otamendi came in instead of Fernandinho in defence. Guardiola said on Tuesday that Sterling was “fit and ready” but the forward was left out. Kroos has been one of Madrid’s most consistent performers this season but Luka Modric was preferred in midfield, next to the more defensive duo of Casemiro and Fede Valverde. Bale has not been a regular in recent weeks and was on the bench again as Zinedine Zidane instead plumped for the pace of Vinicius Junior in the attack.
