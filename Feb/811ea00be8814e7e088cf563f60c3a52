From the opening montage of video for his hit song, Vibrations, one can easily identify the depth of art direction in the costumes and set design of Adedamola Adefolahan’s, also known as Fireboy.
 
Jolting to life within the first two seconds, the video reveals Fireboy seated on a cylindrical pavement, adorned in a pink suit and matching trousers, alongside a nude model, body bathed in Gold paint to match her trumpet. As the tempo switches to a monochrome latino dance groove, with monochrome costumed dancers, Fireboy is seated in front of another monochrome grand piano; a bit of gold on the piano and the chandelier in the room pop and balance the entire scene. The Thank God Omori, also renowned as TG-Omori, directed video is largely about dance, with multiple creative sets – two scenes feature the singer alone in an LED-lit ballroom and another abstract set. The video, which is quite similar to the YBNL singer’s Scatter music video in terms of a full-time dance-video, has a very uniquely appealing ‘happy’ and ‘colourful’ vibe, as the singer plays with dried colour dye alongside some models, making the whole scene a beautiful mess of colours. From the colour arrangement to the salsa dance steps, which perfectly synchronises with the Afro-dancehall/pop single, Vibrations video depicts rich and engaging imagery. The video was released, Monday, on video streaming platform, Youtube, alongside local music Television stations.
