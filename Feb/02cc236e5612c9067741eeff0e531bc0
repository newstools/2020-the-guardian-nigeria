The Osun Government has quarantined 76 persons suspected to be infected with Lassa fever virus in the state. Dr Olasiji Olamiju, the Special Adviser to Gov. Gboyega Oyetola on Public Health, made this known while speaking with newsmen in Osogbo on Wednesday. Olamiju said among the 76 persons quarantined, four were medical doctors. He said the 76 persons were quarantined as part of proactive measures of the state government to prevent the spread of the virus in the state. Olamiju, however, said results of the test conducted on some of the people quarantined came out negative. He said the state government had embarked on vigorous sensitisation on the causes and prevention of the virus in the state. According to him, as a result of the sensitisation, people who noticed symptoms related to the virus have been going to the hospital voluntarily for tests. “Presently we have 76 persons in our net but thankfully some of the results came out negative. “We have been sensitising people in churches, mosques, schools and even markets on the outbreak of Lassa fever. “We have confirmed two cases of the virus in the state but thankfully, the patients had been responding to treatment. “Gov. Oyetola is very passionate about the health of the citizenry and that is why he mandated us to embark on vigorous sensitisation in the state,” Olamiju said. He added that all health officials in government-owned hospitals had been placed on red alert to prevent the spread of the virus.
