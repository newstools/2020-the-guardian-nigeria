The new number “Sade” was rendered on a mid-tempo afrobeat with amazing background sound effects. The 106bpm instrumental begins with African percussions playing, accompanied with simple major chords, with the producer introducing himself and Myles leading us through the song as usual. “Sade” highlights the intents of a lover’s heart as he adulates his lover. “I can be your lucious / You be my cookie,” exposes the singer’s plan to just goof around with this lover of his.
