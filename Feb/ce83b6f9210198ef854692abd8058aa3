23-year-old woman attempts to sell daughters for 1.4 million Naira – vipisasa A 23-year-old woman shocked the residents of Migori town in Kenya on Wednesday when she attempted to sell her two children for Sh400,000 (₦1,444,811). According to Kenyan media outlet Nairobi Wire, the mother of four claimed she was overwhelmed by the burden of raising the children so she opted to sell her daughters, aged two and four years, to raise money to buy a piece of land. The woman claimed that her husband had disowned her. She claimed that all her children were fathered by different men. “I have been through difficult situations with these children. I have decided to sell the young girls for Sh400,000 and buy land where I can settle with their male siblings,” she said. The woman said she had tried in vain to seek assistance from well-wishers. “No one seems to welcome me any more. I lack shelter and I have been living in makeshift structures with the children and sometimes going without food. I would be very happy if I get someone to buy my two daughters,” she said. Officers from Migori Police Station later took her to safe custody.
