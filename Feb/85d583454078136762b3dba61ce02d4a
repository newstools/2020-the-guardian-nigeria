It was also meant to overhaul the petroleum industry, entrench efficiency and transparency in both upstream and downstream sectors and bring operations in line with international standards. Till date, the passage of the bill, which would have paved the way for massive investment in the country’s oil and gas sector has remained bottled up in the National Assembly with successive leadership of the legislature making efforts, with the accompanying horse-trading, to attempt a passage of the bill. Hence, the PIB, which seeks to increase government revenue from oil and lay down a strengthened legal and regulatory framework for the Nigerian oil industry, has suffered legislative delays and limited consideration from the executive. Curiously, even when some Assembly sessions passed the bill, the office of the President had been variously arm-twisted to withhold assent. So, the PIB remains the oldest bill in the National Assembly since 1999 when we regained democratic governance.
