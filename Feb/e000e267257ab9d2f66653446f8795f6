Everyone at City wishes @sterling7 a full and speedy recovery,” City said on their Twitter account. City manager Pep Guardiola will hope Sterling’s absence is not much longer than the West Ham game as his side gear up for a hectic schedule.

City would also want Sterling to be available for the League Cup final against Aston Villa on March 1. The 25-year-old, who came off in the 84th minute against Tottenham, is one of City’s top goalscorers this season with 20 in all competitions. Sterling has only missed two Premier League matches this season, where he was an unused substitute.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
