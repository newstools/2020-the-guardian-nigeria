The famous Fast and Furious saga continues. On Friday, January 31, the “furious family,” including Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, Ludacris, Jordana Brewster, Tyrese Gibson, and newest member John Cena, came together in Miami to unveil the first trailer for their next movie F9 with a special concert event. Cena is the new enemy of Dominic Torretto (Diesel) as seen in the almost four-minute trailer, and this life’s purpose has been fighting better than the Fast & Furious leading man — because they’re brothers. Also, Cardi B and Ozuna are set to make short appearances in the movie, but there’s no sight of them in the new trailer. But there are rocket engines and spaceships, so it’s a must-watch. The trailer unveiling took place in downtown Miami and included performances by Cardi B, Wiz Khalifa, Charlie Puth, Ozuna and Ludacris, plus segments in which the cast shared anecdotes while filming the movie.
