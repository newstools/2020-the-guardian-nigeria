• Insists Ubah forged certificate Nearly three years after the former national chairman of All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Chief Victor Umeh, displaced Senator Uche Lilly Ekwunife for the Anambra Central Senatorial seat through a controversial Appeal Court ruling, another Anambra politician, Dr. Obinna Uzor, is making frantic efforts to replace Senator Ifeanyi Ubah as the representative of Anambra South Senatorial District. Uzoh, a philanthropist and politician, insists Ubah presented a forged National Examination Commission (NECO) certificate, arguing that the lone senator on the platform of Young Progressives Party (YPP) was not qualified to contest the senatorial election.  The YPP Senator has also obtained a stay of action and filed an appeal, in which he argued through his counsel, Dr. Onyechi Ikpeazu, that “the trial court erred in law by refusing to set aside its judgment in Suit No; FCT/HC/CV/3044/2018 by striking out Motion No: 1631/2019 on the grounds that the court processes in Suit No: FCT/HC/CV/3044/2018 were served on the Appellant and therefore occasioned a miscarriage of justice.”
  
Furthermore, in a bid to clarify its position on the disputed certificate, NECO wrote YPP explaining that although Ubah offered eight subjects, only seven subjects were listed on the certificate in line with the tradition of the examination body that failed subjects are not included on result certificates.
   
However, Uzoh maintains that he has irrefutable proof that the NECO school certificate that Ubah tendered to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) was forged, despite the so-called clarifications from the examination council after he was sacked by the court.
