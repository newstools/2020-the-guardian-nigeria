Contrary to reports that made the rounds on Tuesday, the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) yesterday denied ever appointing former Super Eagles’ Striker, Daniel Amokachi as its technical director. The Federation declared that the position had never been declared vacant, adding that Coach Bitrus Bewrang remained its technical director. In a statement made available to The Guardian, the federation said the Nigeria Football Federation has stated that it at no time called for applications from candidates for Bewrang’s position, not to talk of appointing anyone into the post.  “The NFF has been bemused by this unfounded story, which no doubt must have embarrassed Mr. Amokachi himself.”
 
Yusuf Fresh, who is also member of the CAF Technical and Development Committee, commended President Muhammadu Buhari for appointing Amokachi as ambassador of Nigerian Football, adding, “Mr. Amokachi richly deserves this appointment as someone who served our dear nation meritoriously on the field of play as a player and coach.”  “The NFF, once more, enjoins the generality of the media to retain the important work ethic of fact-checking and verification, and beware of empty wildfires lit by obscure online cells that lack any iota of credibility.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
