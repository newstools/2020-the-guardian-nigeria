Thomas Tuchel said Saturday that he was “really surprised” by videos showing his Paris Saint-Germain players at a party on Thursday, two days after their 2-1 Champions League defeat at Borussia Dortmund. “I was really surprised yesterday (Friday) by the video, by the way they were partying. We spoke about it internally, you can be sure of that,” Tuchel told reporters ahead of PSG’s match with Bordeaux. On Friday videos emerged on social media of PSG players on the dance floor celebrating the birthdays of Mauro Icardi, Edinson Cavani and Angel Di Maria, all born in February. “The players had a free day, it’s their private life, yes … you can be sure that we’re not very happy about these images,” added Tuchel, who earlier this month was irritated by Neymar celebrating his birthday in a nightclub two days before a Ligue 1 clash at Nantes. “It was a party planned ahead of the match,” said PSG defender Marquinhos. “It should be said to supporters that it wasn’t about lacking respect towards them.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
