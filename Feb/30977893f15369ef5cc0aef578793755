Bayelsa State Governor, Seriake Dickson, has urged Nigerian leaders to avoid actions and statements that could deepen division and sectionalism in the country, especially at this critical period. He admonished leaders across the country to rather emphasise inter-ethnic harmony and unity in order to realise and achieve the much desired national cohesion. Governor Dickson stated this shortly after being conferred with the Oyi’Ihotu K’Idoma by the paramount ruler of Idoma land, HRH Agabaidu Elias Onekpe, the Och’Idoma 1 of Idoma Kingdom in Otupko, Benue State at the weekend.Dickson urged the traditional institution across the country to emulate the values of the Idoma monarch whose decision to confer the title on him, he said, would strengthen friendship between the Ijaw and Idoma ethnic nationalities. “I bring a message of solidarity and unity that all of us need to close ranks in this country. “Instead of dividing us and tearing us apart, instead of promoting sectionalism, instead of promoting policies that tend to divide us, we should do what Agabaidu and his council of chiefs have done, uniting people instead of tearing them apart,” he said Responding, Onekpe said he conferred the chieftaincy title on Dickson in recognition of his kindness and show magnanimity to the Idoma nation.   According to him, the title was conferred on the Bayelsa Governor in consonance with the age-long Idoma belief of rewarding kindness with kindness, saying Dickson was the third prominent non-Idoma personality to be so honoured by the Idoma Kingdom. He urged the governor who engaged an Idoma son, Francis Agbo, a member of the House of Representatives and his Chief Press Secretary (CPS) among others in his administration, not to relent in rendering service to humanity even after his reign as governor.Chairman of the occasion and former Senate President, David Mark, said Dickson deserved the honour going by the long list of favours he had extended to the Idoma people.
