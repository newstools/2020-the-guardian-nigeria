Wife of late Dr Nnamdi Azikiwe, Prof Uche Azikiwe, urged the government to equip women with knowledge and skills that will position for financial enablement and economic growth. She said this during a three-fold event, which saw the launch of the African Women Capacity Building Network (AWCBN), a book launch titled Corruption Is Not The Problem’ and the 78th birthday ceremony of Dr. Violet Arene. According to Azikiwe, some benefits of capacity building include strengthened skills, knowledge, confidence, minimises over-reliance on others, fosters a sense of ownership and enhances financial growth and development. President, AWCBN, Dr. Violet Arene, said the awareness on empowerment must go beyond its current level to bridge the gender gap for equal opportunities, even at leadership positions. In the book, she said, “We are yet to identify the major problem we have in Nigeria. The book identifies a bigger picture of corruption, beyond the people involved. When you read the book and understand my point of view, you will come closer to the solution to the corruption scourge in Africa. The book is about how far the African continent has gone after independence.” Former Vice-Chancellor, University of Nigeria, Nsukka, BC Ozumba, said there is a need to have more women in STEM as it is essential for socio-economic advancement in Africa. “You cannot empower someone who doesn’t have basic knowledge of what you want to teach. A lot of women are restricted to the other room. I have found out that girls are more serious in the universities but are held down by societal values”, he added. Ozumba noted that to ensure gender equality, there is need for a transformation of mindset.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
