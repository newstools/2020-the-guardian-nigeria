SOURCE: TRIBUNEONLINE World heavyweight boxing champion, Anthony Joshua, made a surprised appearance to his birthplace, Sagamu, Ogun State yesterday. The British boxer who regained his heavyweight titles from Mexican Andy Ruiz last December in Saudi Arabia paid a visit to the Palace of the Akarigbo of Remo in Sagamu at about 1pm. Although, details of his visit was not made public yesterday, the Head of the Anthony Joshua Supporters Club in Sagamu, who is simply called Mr Naira, confirmed the presence of the boxer to journalists. On Tuesday afternoon, picture of Anthony Joshua trended on the social media with him displaying his new Nigerian NIM identity card. He was flanked by two unnamed officials. There was also no mention of where he was registered and presented with the identity card. That first created the speculation that the heavyweight boxer was likely in the country on a private visit. On January 18, Anthony Joshua presented his World heavyweight boxing belts to President Muhammadu Buhari during his visit to the United Kingdom. Joshua’s visit to Buhari was celebrated in the local media with the picture of the gangling boxer prostrating before the President in typical style of a Yoruba son greeting of an elder. The picture attracted several comments from people who eulogised him for not forgetting his Yoruba ancestry despite fighting as a Briton. Anthony Joshua was born in Watford to a Nigerian mother, Yeta Odusanya and a British father of Nigerian and Irish descent, Robert, in 1989. He made his debut alongside his cousin, Ben Illeyemi, who is also a professional boxer, in 2013. According to reports, Joshua spent some of his early years in Nigeria and was a boarding school student at Mayflower School in Ikenne. He was said to have returned to the United Kingdom when he was 12 years old.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
