Justice Nelson Ogbuanya of the National Industrial Court (NIC), Port-Harcourt has upheld the 14-day appearance for defendant sued in the court as contained in its rules. 
  
Dismissing the preliminary objection filed by the defendant in the suit between Kassem Tay v. Provita Vitaforce Foods Nigeria Ltd in suit No.NICN/PHC/392019, Justice Ogbuanya held that the 14 days required for the defendant to enter appearance in a suit in the court is valid.
   
According to the judge, it is the provision of the rules of a specialized court, adding that the defendant has not shown how the rule has affected its constitutional right to fair hearing, as canvassed in its preliminary objection.  Justice Ogbuanya noted that he was earlier, in the case of Yusuf Yahaya v. FRSC in suit.No: NICN/YL/06/2014, ruling of which was delivered on December 7, 2017, confronted with similar argument against the rules of the court regarding the conflict with the provisions of the sister Section 97 of the Sherriff & Civil Process Act, which required leave of court to issue and serve court processes across various states of the federation. 
 
In coming to his decision in the Yahaya’s case,  to uphold the court’s rule, the judge stated: “I took the view and held that by virtue of the extant rules of this court, no such leave is required for service of court process in-between states in Nigeria, as Industrial Court has one territorial jurisdiction throughout Nigeria. This position was arrived at after strenuously distinguishing the Supreme Court decisions in owners of M.V Arabella v. NAIC [2008] 11 NWLR [pt.1097]182 (M.V Arabella) and Drexel Energy and Natural Resources Ltd & 2 Ors. v. Trans International Bank Ltd & Ors. [2008] 18 NWLR [pt.1119]388 (Drexel Energy).
