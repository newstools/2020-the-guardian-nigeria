The Seyi Makinde administration has imposed a daily tax of N200 on all commercial motorcyclists in Oyo State. This was disclosed on Monday when the state government inaugurated the state Park Management System to replace the proscribed National Union of Road Transport Workers in the state. “Park Management System begins operation first in the Pace Setter State as we hope this will be a pathfinder for transports system reform in the State and beyond,” Seyi Makinde said at the inauguration. “It is important to note that this initiative is in line with Gov. Seyi Makinde’s plan to boost the State IGR as State money will no longer go into private purses & desperate transporters accounts.” Park Management System, which doesn’t have any affiliation with the NURTW, will be responsible to collect revenue on behalf of the government. The new PMS would include a team of Park Managers who will coordinate activities at the parks located in each of the 33 local governments, as well as two disciplinary Committees to coordinate Motor Parks and Tippers/Lorries Parks, the state’s Commissioner for Public Works, Infrastructure and Transport, Professor Raphael Afonja, said. A statement by the Chief Press Secretary to Governor Seyi Makinde, Mr Taiwo Adisa, quoted the commissioner as saying that the development was borne out of the pressing need to ensure sanity in the management of the parks.
