With the world fast-evolving, and nations gradually becoming less oil dependent, experts have canvassed the importance of data mining for business and economic growth in Nigeria.
  
Data mining is a process used to extract usable data from a larger set of any raw data for information sharing, among others. Speaking in Lagos, at a financial inclusion forum organised by Eyowo Integrated Limited, the Chief Customer Architect and Data Scientist at Oracle, Dr. Olufemi Oyenuga, said data remains the world’s most valuable resource. He stressed that the same way oil was the defining resource of the 20th Century, data is now the defining resource of the 21st, adding that digital information is unlike any previous resource; it is extracted, refined, valued, bought and sold in different ways.  He said the forum with the theme: “Driving Business growth with data,” was aimed at creating an avenue where retailers and business owners can learn how to improve business performance using modern tools and strategies.
 
“The boost to your business retail seminar is one of many steps we are taking to achieve our vision, which is to promote and drive financial inclusion throughout Africa. We believe this is very possible,” he said.Amao explained that Eyowo provides simple, modern and reliable financial services to anyone with a phone number, including consumers, retailers, businesses, and developers.
