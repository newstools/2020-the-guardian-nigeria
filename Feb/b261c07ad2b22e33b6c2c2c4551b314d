Therefore it comes as no surprise that we are hearing the studio is developing a live-action remake of the popular Rapunzel movie, The DisInsider reports. However, there is no word on if the film has any relation to any of the Tangled franchises such as the 2010 film, the Tangled Ever After Short (2012), The Disney Channel original Tangled Before Ever After (2017), and Tangled The Series (2017-). So far what is known about the new project is that Ashleigh Powell (The Nutcracker and the Four Realms) is writing the script, and the movie will be produced by Michael De Luca (Moneyball, Captain Phillips) of Michael de Luca Productions and Kristin Burr (Christopher Robin) of Burr! Productions, who is also producing Cruella.

Lucy Kitada (Eleanor & Park) will oversee the production. Also, the studio is currently searching for a director to tackle the film that we hear is being made for a theatrical release, and not a Disney+ exclusive like Lady and the Tramp. Tangled was a hit with audiences and critics alike, would go on to make over $590 million at the worldwide box office, and would become the most successful Disney animated feature film since The Lion King in 1994, both financially and commercially. The film would also start a brand new movement for the Disney company in terms of aesthetics and marketability similar to how The Little Mermaid impacted the Disney Renaissance.
