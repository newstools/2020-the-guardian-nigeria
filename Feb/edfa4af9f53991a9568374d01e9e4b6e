It finally came in the 93rd minute of a 1-1 draw against Hellas Verona in the San Siro. “My debut was a dream, shame about the result,” said Maldini. “We could have done more, but there was still a lot of emotion. “Verona is a tough team, we deserved the three points but we brought home a draw. We hope to win the next one.” Maldini made his debut 35 years after his father Paolo and 66 after his grandfather Cesare. “This debut was a goal that I had set myself, now we hope to go on like this. I felt a strong emotion but my father reassures me,” he added.

Cesare also coached the team twice in 1973-1974 and 2001. Paolo — considered among the best defenders of all time — holds the record for matches played in Serie A with 647, all for AC Milan, winning seven Scudetto and five Champions League trophies. The 51-year-old Maldini played his final game on May 31, 2009, and is currently technical director of the northern Italian side, who are eighth in the league. His older son Christian played for AC Milan’s youth team through to the U19 level and now plays in the Italian lower divisions.
