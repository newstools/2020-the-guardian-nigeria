The International Maritime Organisation (IMO), has urged member states to undertake all possible measures to prevent unnecessary delay of ships amid the outbreak of the novel Corona virus.
 
The IMO, in a letter to member-states, yesterday, urged state authorities and control regimes, companies and shipmasters to cooperate to ensure that where appropriate, passengers can be embarked and disembarked. Also, such a process should allow cargo operations, ships can enter and depart shipyards for repair and survey, stores and supplies can be loaded, certificates can be issued, and crew can be exchanged.  Meanwhile, the International Labour Organisation (ILO), said: “In the context of the evolving Corona virus outbreak, the effective protection of the health and safety of seafarers should be a priority. Under the International Labour Organisation’s (ILO) Maritime Labour Convention, 2006, flag states must ensure that all seafarers on ships flying their flag are covered by adequate measures for the protection of their health and that they have access to prompt and adequate medical care whilst working on board.” “The Convention also requires port States to ensure that seafarers on board ships in their territory who are in need of immediate medical care are given access to medical facilities on shore,” it stated.
