The ban on commercial motorbikes (okada) and tricycles (keke) on selected roads and areas of Lagos is a necessary measure, even if it is inconvenient at the moment. It is a task that has to be done if Lagos city is to become the kind of city the government and the people so much desire. Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Gbenga Omotoso quoting scary casualty figures, explained that the government “decided that the security and safety of lives of Lagosians are paramount. From 2016 to 2019, over 10, 000 accidents had been recorded at the general hospitals alone while over 600 deaths were reported. He added that, “the rate of crimes aided by motorbikes and tricycles keeps rising including being used as get-away means by criminals.”
 
This is not an unusual measure in the country. Years ago, the Abuja city authorities banned such vehicles; successive governments of Imo State banned first the motorcycles, and subsequently, the tricycles.  But it is worthy to emphasise that these governments quickly put in place alternative and effective means of transport. The somewhat seamless implementation of the policy indicated good planning.  Two examples will suffice: Despite the provisions of extant laws and the design of an existing Lagos master plan on what, when and how buildings should be erected, people build with substandard materials in areas not  designated for such purpose. Fuel service stations are erected in high-density areas and commercial activities are allowed in areas not so designated.
 
In the past eight years, successive governments have enacted three edicts on public transportation with specific pronouncements on the activities of motorbikes and tricycles. The then Governor Babatunde Fashola signed into law on August 2, 2012 the Lagos State Traffic Law, which barred “persons, form riding, driving, or manually propelling a cart, wheelbarrow, motorcycle and tricycle on 11 highways, 41 bridges and  496 routes within the state including Ikoyi, Victoria Island and Lekki.  It further forbids commercial motorcyclists from carrying more than one person, pregnant women and children below 12 years of age, as well as an adult with a baby or with a heavy load on the head.’’  We would admit the need for small vehicles to transport people and goods in the inner parts of the city.  Certainly, people need such to get to the main roads where bus stops are located.  Certainly, not everyone has a personal vehicle, or can drive one. Certainly, not everyone can endure a long walk –especially the aged and the sick. Besides, barely two weeks into the implementation of the law against motorcycles and tricycles has shown just how much so many Lagosians depend on these means to get around. The bus stops are ever so full of hapless people waiting for the very inadequate number of alternative means of transportation. People are truly stressed and under pressure. Regardless of the “representations to the government concerning commercial motorcycles and tricycles, including rights groups, unionists and traders”, according to Omotoso, there appears to be inadequate planning to alleviate the difficulties that will arise with the law.  Of course, the state government has done a few things – more buses and ferries. Beside that these are not adequate, they are not at all appropriate to inner-city transportation needs.
 
Granted that security of lives and property is the first –and one aspect – of the constitutional duty of government, the criticisms that attend the new measure are not totally unfounded.  First, the point must be made that many – including well-educated ones, are engaged in the tricycle and motorbike business for lack of a better choice of work. The ban has thrown them back into the unemployment market. The social implication is dangerous.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
