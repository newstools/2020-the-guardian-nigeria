Specifically, the $10 million is a debt financing round, from HQ Financial Group (HQF), Singapore-based private company, which specialises in new material science, semiconductor and blockchain financial investments.
    
Granted to a Nigerian fintech start-up, Aella, the debt financing round is the firm’s second raise and is expected to bolster the company’s commitment to serving the underbanked population in West Africa and other emerging markets.
 
Aella was founded in late 2015 by Akin Jones, CEO and Akanbi Wale, CTO, in Lagos, Nigeria, and has remained committed to building trustworthy credit for emerging markets with an initial focus on Nigeria and the Philippines, where the company is licensed to operate. Aella has made a visible impact on the lives of more than 300,000 borrowers across its Employer Backed and Direct to Consumer Verticals, who now have access to simple financial products.  “We are building a one-stop app for all transactions partnered with regulated industry leaders to help distribute products faster, better and cheaper to end-users in Nigeria and across the markets we plan to launch. This app will allow users to access multiple financial services at low costs compared to what is currently available in the market,” Jones added.
