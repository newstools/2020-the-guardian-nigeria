The House of Representatives has threatened to withhold the 2020 budget of Yaba College of Technology (YABATECH), Lagos State, for allegedly failing to submit its audited reports to the Auditor-General of the Federation (AuGF) since 2014 as required by law. The decision came last Friday when the management of the institution led by the rector, Obafemi Omokungbe, appeared before the Femi Oke-led House Committee on Public Accounts. The committee is probing the level of compliance by non-treasury funded and partially funded agencies to render their audited accounts for the period 2014 to 2018 to the AuGF.
