Nigerians have been urged to devote more of their energies into humanitarian ventures and activities, which will, in turn, bring about rapid development in the country and reduce criminality in society. This charge was given by the Rotary International District 9110 Governor, Dr. Jide Akeredolu when he led members of the club on a Rotary awareness walk. The walk began from Ndubuisi Kanu Park, Alausa all the way through Awolowo Way, Ikeja to the Rotary Centre at Ikeja GRA, a distance of more than 10km, as Rotarians shared leaflets and materials aimed at inspiring more people to get involved in humanitarian services. Speaking to newsmen after the walk, Akeredolu said humanitarian organisations like Rotary are in place to join hands with the government to make positive changes in their various communities. “Rotary Club is a community of humanitarians touching people’s lives. Just as the government cannot do it all, we also cannot do it all, which is why we are embarking on this walk to sensitise the general public on the need to go back to their communities, engage more in humanitarian work to affect other people’s lives positively.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
