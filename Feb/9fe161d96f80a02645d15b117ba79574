Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has said the ongoing infrastructural development programme of the Lagos State Government, is a deliberate effort to make the State attractive to Diaspora investment. Sanwo-Olu said there would be no point requesting Nigerians abroad to come back home to invest if the local business environment does not support their aspirations. The Governor disclosed this on his twitter handle, @jidesanwoolu yesterday while receiving His Worship, the Mayor of Brampton City in Ontario, Canada, Patrick Brown, who led a delegation to the State House in Alausa, on a courtesy visit. Sanwo-Olu said the Canadian city shared similar history with Lagos, stressing that both cities had grown over the decades to become the hubs of commerce and Information and Communication Technology (ICT). The Governor said Lagos would be seeking bilateral cooperation with the political leadership of the Canadian city in the areas of cyber security, food security, and technology among others. Sanwo-Olu said the smart city initiative of his administration would enhance the Government’s capacity to leverage technology in improving security, and driving tourism potential of the State. Brown on his part, described Nigerians living in Brampton as “resilient people”, saying their influence on the city’s economy and culture contributed to its economic prosperity and social development. The Mayor welcomed Lagos Governor’s invitation for collaboration in various areas, including education, ICT, agriculture and cyber security.
