The Nigerian Communication Commission (NCC), is upbeat on the country’s move towards the deployment of broadband facilities to boost Nigeria’s digital landscape.
  
While exploring every means, the Commission said it is also not ruling out broadband satellite services.
   
NCC stated this, when Viasat, a commercial satellite operator, visited the Commission in Abuja, yesterday, to give an update on its readiness to deploy satellite broadband services in Nigeria.  The NigComSat’s satellite broadband service can be deployed almost anywhere, in a very short time, especially for business continuity and connectivity in remote, hard to reach locations or temporary sites
   
The firm explained that its services are cost-effective, secure, with high-speed data and video Internet connections that are tailored for optimal delivery in communications, disaster recovery and security applications.
  
Nigeria currently has 72 million broadband penetrations or 37.8 per cent, whereas there are 126 million Nigerians connected to the Internet via the narrowband, the GSM technology.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
