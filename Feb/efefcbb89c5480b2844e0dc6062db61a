Ogun State police commissioner has ordered the arrest of the officer involved in the arrest that led to the death of Remo Stars Sports Club player Tiyamiyu Kazeem. Police spokesman Abimbola Oyeyemi, in a statement, said the officer was unprofessional for leaving an arrested person in a vehicle. The police spokesman, however, said claims that Kazeem was killed by the police were untrue. Eyewitnesses said Kazeem was  arrested while driving along Sagamu road area of Ogun State with one of his teammates, Sanni Abubakar. He was accused of being an internet fraudster and the officers, who arrested him, insisted on taking him to the nearby police station. “The SARS officer stopped Tiyamiyu Kazeem, insisting that he was a Yahoo boy. He brought out his identity (ID) card to identify himself as a player of Remo Stars FC, but the officer insisted on taking him to the nearest police station in Sagamu.” But Oyeyemi said the assistant captain of the club was arrested for putting on military apparel despite not being a military personnel. “The inspector went to shagamu and saw the deceased puting on a military cap consequent upon which he got him arrested,” Oyeyemi said. While taking the deceased in a vehicle to Abeokuta, Oyeyemi said the vehicle they were traveling in developed a mechanical fault and while the officer was trying to rectify the fault, Tiamiyu jumped down from the vehicle to escape. “In his bid to run across the road, an on coming vehicle which is on high speed knocked him down and he died on the spot,” Oyeyemi claimed. “A full scale investigation into the case has commenced by state criminal investigation and intelligence department.” The club said it is also doing everything possible to investigate Kaka’s death.
