The Supreme Court Friday affirmed the sentence and conviction of the former Governor of Taraba State, Reverend Jolly Nyame. Nyame was in 2018 convicted by the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) and the Court of Appeal, respectively over N1.6 billion fraud charges brought against him by the federal government. The apex court, however, set aside the fines imposed on him by the two courts on the grounds that they were outrageous and done without any prompting. Nyame had appealed the November 16, 2018 judgment of the Court of Appeal, Abuja, which affirmed his conviction by a High Court of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) in Gudu, Abuja in a judgment given on May 30, 2018, by Justice Adebukola Banjoko. The Court of Appeal had affirmed Nyameâ€™s conviction and ordered the forfeiture of his identified assets. It, however, faulted the trial court in its decision to impose a maximum sentence.
