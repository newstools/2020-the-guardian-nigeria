President, Lagos Country Club (LCC), Tajudeen Akande, has denied allegations of financial impropriety, violation of the club’s Constitution and corporate governance ethics leveled against him and other members of the club’s management council. A petition by the Social Secretary, Adewole Folarin, to the club’s chairman, Board of Trustees (BOT) last November, had alleged that Akande, Vice President Igho Okor and Secretary-General, Ayokunle Jimoh had, during the club’s 70th anniversary, did not observe due process in contract awards and violated the club’s Constitution. But Akande, in a letter by his legal representatives, Olaniyi Adekanla & Co., said he “did not breach any provision of the club’s constitution and in all his dealing and management of the Club funds, he always follow due process as laid down in the rules and regulations of the Club.” Akande is a distinguished member and fellow of a number of professional organisations, among which are the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN), Chartered Institute of Taxation of Nigeria (CITN), Nigerian Institute of Management (NIM) and the Institute of Directors (IoD). He is also a high-ranking Chief of Ikorodu town. Meanwhile, the Board of Registered Trustees of the Lagos Country Club had inaugurated an ad-hoc investigation committee to look into the allegations raised by the petitioner.
