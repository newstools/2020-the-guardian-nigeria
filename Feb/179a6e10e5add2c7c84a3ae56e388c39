Former Super Eagles Goalkeepers’ Trainer, Joe Erico believes ex-national team captain, Joseph Yobo has the pedigree to assist Coach Gernot Rohr despite not having any coaching experience. Erico, who commended the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) for the appointment, stated that the vast experience Yobo acquired from different coaches in foreign clubs and the Nigerian national team was enough to guarantee the former Everton of England FC defender a role in the Super Eagles. He noted that Yobo’s appointment as an assistant in the Eagles team, will motivate the young talented players in the squad, adding that the call to national duty showed that the NFF was ready to give former internationals that gave their best to the country a chance to offer their wealth of experience to the younger ones. “A player that has achieved 100 caps playing for the Nigeria’s senior national team, captained Everton FC of England, as the first African to achieve that feat and also played at the AFCON, World Cup and Champions League is not lacking in experience. “Playing at the highest level has given Yobo the chance to learn from different coaches. Getting his first coaching assignment with the Super Eagles does not matter because anybody can start at any level in coaching. With time, more experience will be added to the ones he already has. “If he does not have coaching certificate, he can acquire it on the job. I believe the Eagles will do better with Yobo on the bench because most of the Super Eagles players respect him a lot,” Erico said.
