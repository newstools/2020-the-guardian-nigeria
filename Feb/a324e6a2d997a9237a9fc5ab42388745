The Oyo State governor, Seyi Makinde, has declared that he would not hesitate to waive his immunity if called to question concerning corruption. Spokesperson of the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC), Rasheedat Okoduwa, quoted the governor to have stated this while speaking at the commissioning of a new state ICPC office in Ibadan, Oyo State. According to Okoduwa, Makinde said his decision would help set the tone for an effective anti-corruption fight in the state. Makinde, represented by the Secretary to the State Government, Mrs. Olubamiwo Adeosun, stressed that the fight against corruption must be taken seriously by all stakeholders to address the many problems it has caused Nigeria. He said: “We cannot really go far in achieving our objectives if we allow corruption to maintain its hold on the system. That is why we are not mincing words on this issue to waive my own immunity if there is any reason to call me to question.” The governor also commended ICPC, observing that the Commission had set a high standard in fighting corruption, which should be emulated by other Federal Government agencies in the state. “I must commend ICPC for the studious methods it has adopted in carrying out its three-pronged mandate of enforcement, prevention and public education. This has led to the conviction of many public officers and the prosecution of many more.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
