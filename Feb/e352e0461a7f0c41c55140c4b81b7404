• Sold out for today’s screening, Sunday too Nigeria feature film, Eyimofe, which premiered at the ongoing Berlin International Film Festival has continued to enjoy an impressive run at the festival, with both the premiere and second screening at Colosseum 1, Prenzlauer Berg sold out.
   
Ahead of today’s screening at the 670-seater capacity Delphi Filmpalast, Chartlottenburg, information from the cinema shows that the ticket has already been sold out since yesterday. Also, tickets for the final screening on Sunday, March 1, have also been sold out, which means there’s likelihood that many might not be able to see the film in Berlin.  On the day of the Berlinale Publikumstag, Sunday, March 1, 2020, there will be an encore for the audience. Numerous festival films from the different sections will be repeated in the Berlinale venues. Tickets for the performances at the Berlinale Publikumstag have been available since February 17.
   
“It’s truly great to experience our first festival together and to greet the international film teams and guests. We’re very happy to see how the Berlinale fans celebrate film art and to witness their openness towards new discoveries”, said the new festival directors Mariette Rissenbeek and Carlo Chatrian.
   
Five days after it began, the European Film Market (EFM) can also look back on a more than busy audience and similarly draws a positive interim balance. Strong exhibitor and visitor numbers and a further increase in interest in the events and initiatives of the EFM once again underline the importance of the market as one of the most important trading platforms for audio-visual content worldwide.
