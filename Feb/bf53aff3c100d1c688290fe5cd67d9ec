The Rivers State Executive Council has approved the sale of the abandoned Stock Exchange Building near Federal Road Safety Corps office on Aba Road, Port Harcourt.
At its meeting presided over by Governor Nyesom Wike, the council reached the decision following reports that criminal elements have taken over the facility that was acquired by the state government. Addressing journalists yesterday, Commissioner of Information and Communication, Paulinus Nsirim, said the state government decided to acquire the building because its construction was abandoned in 2012 due to lack of funds. He said the structure has become a hideout for criminals in that part of the state capital, adding that council also approved that advertisements be placed in the media to invite buyers to purchase the property.
