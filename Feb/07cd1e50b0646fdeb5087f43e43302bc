 Members of the emergency services evacuate residents from flooded houses by rescue boat after the River Taff burst its banks in Nantgarw, south of Ponypridd in south Wales on February 16, 2020, after Storm Dennis caused flooding across large swathes of Britain. – As Storm Dennis sweeps in, the country is bracing itself for widespread weather disruption for the second weekend in a row. Experts have warned that conditions amount to a “perfect storm”, with hundreds of homes at risk of flooding.

Almost 200 flood warnings were in place early on Sunday, extending from Scotland’s River Tweed to Cornwall in southwest England. Winds of over 90 miles per hour (150 kilometres per hour) were recorded in Aberdaron, south Wales. The Ministry of Defence had earlier deployed troops in West Yorkshire, northern England, which suffered badly from flooding caused by last weekend’s Storm Ciara. “Our armed forces are always ready to support local authorities and communities whenever they need it,” said defence minister Ben Wallace. British Airways and easyJet confirmed they had grounded flights, while two bodies were pulled from rough seas off the south England coast on Saturday as the storm barrelled in. One of the men is assumed to have been the subject of a search triggered when an LPG tanker reported that one of its crew was unaccounted for. He was last seen several hours earlier.
