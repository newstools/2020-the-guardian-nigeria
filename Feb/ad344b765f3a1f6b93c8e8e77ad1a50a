Abia North Integrity Group (ANIG) has urged Abia Central and Abia South senatorial zones to respect the state’s gubernatorial rotation order and not present governorship candidates for the 2023 election. The pressure group specifically told Governor Okezie Ikpeazu to ensure that his supporters reciprocated the support given to him in 2015 and 2019 that resulted in his election and re-election after the North and Central zones had taken their turns in the governorship position in line with the Abia Charter of Equity. The charter propounded that the governorship position should rotate among the three zones of Abia North, Abia Central and Ikpeazu’s Abia South took turns and paved the way for serving of South to take the turn of the South. ANIG spokesman, Chief Idika Agwu, told The Guardian after its meeting at Okun Ohafia yesterday, said, “Each of the three zones had taken turn beginning with the North in 1999 followed by the Central in 2007 and South now completing its turn that started in 2015. Abia North should, for equity, justice and order, begin another round of rotation in 2023.” The group comprising scholars, clerics, monarchs and political strategists from Abia North, therefore, urged all political parties in the state, especially the ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), to cede their governorship slot to Abia North. It commended PDP stakeholders from Abia North who supported powershift to Abia South in 2015 and firmly stood behind the second term ambition of Ikpeazu to enable the zone complete its turn, urging political stakeholders from other zones to emulate the exemplary role of their Abia North counterparts and prevail on their people to support powershift to Abia North come 2023.
