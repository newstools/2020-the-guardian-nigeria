Akwa Ibom State Governor, Udom Emmanuel has identified lack of awareness and inadequate publicity as the reason why most Nigerian workers are averse to contributing to the Nigerian Social Insurance Trust Fund (NSITF). Emmanuel stated this, yesterday, when the Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr. Chris Ngige, led a team of NSITF officials on a courtesy visit to Government House, Uyo. The governor noted that in this digital age, NSITF should have a website to educate people about its activities and create awareness among Nigerians, especially on the need for them to save for their future. According to him, Nigeria with her huge population cannot ignore such a laudable scheme, adding that social security is key in reducing agitations. He described the scheme as a major feat in the social security arrangement of the country and assured of the readiness of his administration to key into the scheme. Earlier, Ngige explained that NSITF was an agency of the Federal Government under the supervision of his ministry, and saddled with the responsibility of managing workers, social security protection from work-related hazards, and ensuring adequate compensation in the case of accident, incapacitation, or death. The Minister stated that the scheme, in line with the 2010 Act of Parliament of the Federal Government of Nigeria, provides that with as low as one percent of monthly pay, workers can be paid their premium and other benefits. He, therefore, urged the state government to enroll workers in the scheme, so as to be at par with employees of the federal government.
