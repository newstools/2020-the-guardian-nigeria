She went on to share a personal experience where her two brothers who were frequent callers at Fela’s Shrine back in the days got arrested and spent six years in prison. In response to this statement, Seun Kuti shared the video on his page with a caption which reads: See all these Lies by these idiots. Fela Name don full everyone mouth. These idiots that know of nothing sacred. Now this one is talking about her brothers that went to shrine and police locked them for 6 years for fighting? Does that make sense. I grew up in the shrine, where is my Kiri Kiri record. Let me advise Nigerian Parents, it’s ur duty to raise your kids and this woman is just as dangerous to their psyche as the ‘Marlian’ syndrome u are afraid of! It is because we allow people like this interact with our children we have an educational system that tends to reduce justice as it produces lawyers, reduces health as it produces doctors and created ignorance as it produces teachers hence the more lawyers the less justice. The more doctors the less health and the more teachers the more ignorance. Everyone just dey disrespect Fela as dem like, now this goats and her goat twins have gone to prison for ‘6 years for fighting’. Better tell the world that ur brothers were robbers.
