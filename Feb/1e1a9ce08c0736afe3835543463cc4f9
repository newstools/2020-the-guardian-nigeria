Amokachi Trabzonspor condemn racial abuse of John Obi Mikel
President Muhammadu Buhari has appointed retired Nigerian professional footballer, former Super Eagles player and Assistant Coach, Daniel Amokachi, as the country’s Football Ambassador. Amokachi, a member of the 1994 Super Eagles Team that won the African Nations Cup in Tunisia, was also in the Nigerian Olympic Football Team to the 1996 Atlanta Olympics that won the Gold Medal. In addition to his football exploits in Europe, particularly in England where he won the FA Cup with Everton in 1995, Amokachi after retirement has managed Nasarawa United and Enyimba Football Club of Aba. As Nigeria’s Football Ambassador – a largely ceremonial role – Amokachi will assist the Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports Development to scout for talents, be part of processes to revive the country’s football development, as well as mentor young sports men and women. Meanwhile, Turkish side, Trabzonspor have condemned the racial abuse aimed at former Chelsea midfielder, John Mikel Obi following their win over Fenerbahce on Saturday, reports BBC. The Nigerian international, 32, was targeted on social media after a 2-1 victory that moved Trabzonspor above their opponents into third place. The club say they have filed “criminal complaints” against those responsible. “Racism is a shelter for [the] helpless and ignorant,” Trabzonspor said in a statement on Twitter. Mikel’s Trabzonspor team-mate Joao Pereira said it was “sad and unacceptable”. “Football is much bigger than the little people behind these unfortunate acts,” he wrote on Twitter. Mikel moved to Turkey this season after a stint with English Championship side, Middlesborough last season. The former Super Eagles captain spent the last four seasons in the Chinese Super League with Tiajin Teda before deciding to return to European football in 2017.
