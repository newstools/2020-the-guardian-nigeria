In a bid to meet the standard required of the best badminton courts in the world, the Ikoyi Club Badminton Section recently constructed a state of the art court ahead of its 2020  engagements.
 
Chairman of the Badminton Section, Ikoyi Club 1938, Kassim AbdulRahman said refurbishing the court would enable national team badminton players, who don’t have the financial power to train outside the country to use the facility. On the activities lined up for the 2020 season, AbdulRahman said the Ikoyi Club would organise top class badminton championships for its members and also groom talents from the grassroots, who would in future represent the country in international championships.
“I am delighted that Ikoyi Club has finally finished putting in place the best state of the art court you can find anywhere in the world. “Apart from exposing our members to the facility, we also put the court in place to aid national team players to train properly ahead of any event. Apart from exposure to international championships abroad, which is good for an athlete to grow in the sport, I don’t think any badminton player will complain of not having a standard court to train, owing to the fact that Ikoyi Club now has the best court you can find any where in the world. “Our objective in 2020 is to get more members, organise local and international championships. “The club is also ready to work with the Badminton Federation of Nigeria to groom players. National team players are free to use Ikoyi Club Badminton Club facilities to train,” he saidAbdulRahman disclosed that making badminton one of the top sports in Nigeria was Ikoyi Club’s target and urged corporate bodies to join in sponsoring activities at the club.The chairman also enjoined parents to encourage their children to play badminton, saying that the sport helps to improve the health and wellbeing of players.
