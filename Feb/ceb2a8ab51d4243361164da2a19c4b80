The Cross River State government will soon commence the process of revamping grassroots development and therefore needs the private sector support, the state’s Commissioner for Sports and Cinematography, Offu Aya, has revealed. Calling on the private sector to participate in sponsorship of the various sporting activities in the state, Aya said the state was ready to explore viable options capable of revamping the sector. “Such approach has become imperative to encourage public private partnership for optimal impact given the capital intensive nature of sports and lean resources at the disposal of the government,” Aya said. He listed possible targets for the envisaged deal to include the management of the ultra-modern swimming pool, the 53-room stadium hostel, resuscitation of school sports and other grassroots based games to project budding talents to limelight. He lauded the media for its leading role in sports development and solicited for robust synergy to guarantee attainment of set targets for mutual benefit. On the forthcoming National Sports Festival billed for Edo State, Aya revealed that Cross River would compete in 43 sports and expressed optimism of medals haul given the level of preparation by the state’s athletes. On the suspended Obudu International Mountain Race, he said it would soon be back on stream, adding that the state was working gradually towards it. Aya disclosed that Governor Ben Ayade had started putting on ground such infrastructure as the road network to the ranch and other facilities.
