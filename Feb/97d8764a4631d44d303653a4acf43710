The Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr Chris Ngige, has urged graduating trainees of the N-Power Programme, to form Cooperatives to enable them access loans.
Ngige gave the advice when he visited trainees at Anamco and Tetralog Mechatronics companies in Enugu.He said with Cooperatives, the N-POWER trainees can access loans from Federal Government agencies like the National Directorate of Employment (NDE), Industrial Training Fund (ITF), and Bank of Industry (BoI). He further disclosed that NDE and ITF also have empowerment programmes for graduates like starter packs, which he said, could enable them become employers of labour. The Minister, who expressed satisfaction with the trainees, used the opportunity to dismiss rumours making the rounds that the Federal Government had scrapped and abandoned the N-POWER empowerment programme. Reacting further, he said what was going was on was repackaging, adding that in the process amendments could be done in some areas.Ngige, who also visited the Akanu Ibiam International Airport, Enugu, to inspect ongoing upgrade of facilities, said he was happy with the schedule of work and the terminal date for the full rehabilitation “Schedule of work, first and foremost, the time they put as the terminal date for the full rehabilitation is ok; the date is 31st of March, Easter is middle of April. That gives us a time lag of two weeks for the other things to be consummated.“So we are ok with that. Quality of work is also ok with us. If they continue with the rate of work and quality of work, we will have no problem; the funds are there” he stated. On his part, the Chief Executive Officer, Tetralog Mechatronics Company,  Onuorah Nnabuko, commended the minister for his visit, noting that training was constant in  every human activity. He said although some of the trainees may claim that they have acquired enough training to start something, there was a need for them to obtain more tuition to make them better.“Training is a constant thing and everybody needs training and you will continue to be trained,” he said.
