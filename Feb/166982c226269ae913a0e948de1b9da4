Haitian musician and ex-Fugees member Wyclef Jean has raised $25m to fund music publishing services in Africa, the Caribbean and other developing regions through his newly launched publishing and distribution company, Carnival World Music Group. Speaking to Forbes, the three-time Grammy award winner said his latest initiative would seek to empower creatives by giving them access to publishing and distribution resources needed to promote their music and earn royalties. “Carnival World Music Group aims to ensure that artistes in developing countries have publishing and distribution support they need,” Jean said. “The demand for music from Africa and other developing regions is growing, and these creatives deserve to be part of the international marketplace. “There is a need for them to have open access to global publishing and distribution options that protect their rights and ensure that they are fairly paid. This initiative not only introduces and launches new talent but helps creatives around the world thrive in their careers.” Jean said Carnival World Music Group would launch later this year in search of new talent. He added that Heads Music, an independent music operation based in New York, would handle distribution and publishing for Carnival World Music Group. In December 2019, the musician announced a partnership with Sound Royalties, an entertainment industry finance firm that helps creatives fund projects. The partnership allows Carnival World Music Group to be financed by Sound Royalties to support creative talent in the target markets. “Somebody gave me the knowledge and protected me. What I like about Sound Royalties is that [Sound Royalties CEO] Alex [Heiche] is in the same place,” Jean said.“My heart is with this partnership because he has already helped artists in different ways, but the idea of solidifying this with a publishing company takes it to the next level.”
