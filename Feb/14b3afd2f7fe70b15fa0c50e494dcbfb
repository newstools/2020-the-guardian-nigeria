PHOTO: ADEMOLA OLANIRAN The Lagos State Traffic Management Authority (LASTMA) has debunked a trending social media report alleging that traffic officials, particularly LASTMA officers, have been banned from arresting violators of traffic laws and restricted to traffic control. The LASTMA General Manager Olajide Oduyoye refuted the claim that the decision emanated from a meeting between Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu and executives of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) at an unspecified date, time or venue. Oduyoye maintained that there was no meeting between Lagos State Government and the NURTW, stressing that the 2018 Traffic Law clearly spelled out the duties of LASTMA officers, saying that it is irresponsible and mischievous for any individual to insinuate that the governor gave directives contrary to the law. He also noted that the Transportation and Traffic Management constitute a vital part of the present administrationâ€™s T.H.E.M.E.S agenda Oduyoye said the government had always emphasised the need for LASTMA officials to uphold the law, irrespective of anyone involved. The General Manager, therefore, advised the public to ignore and disregard the fake news designed to confuse and hoodwink motorists into breaking traffic rules. He also noted that violators will face the sanctions prescribed by the law.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
