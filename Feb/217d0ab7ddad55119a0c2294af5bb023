The Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA), yesterday, told the travelling public to bear with the airlines, as multiple flight delays and cancellations were unavoidable.
  
The submission is a departure from the penchant to blame the airlines for poor customer services and threats of sanctions against culprits.
  
Indeed, the frequency of flight delays has lately worsened. The Consumer Protection Directorate (CPD) of the NCAA, last year reported that at least 3,049 flights were delayed in October 2019, with the bulk of the delays coming from domestic operations.  He observed that most operators often put all their aircraft into service at once, to get the highest returns. But all their plans easily get scuttled when one of the operating aircraft goes out of service. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
