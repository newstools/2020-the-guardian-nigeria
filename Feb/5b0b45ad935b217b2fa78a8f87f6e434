The controller was told that only a healthy accused person could stand trial in court.Besides, one of the counsels to the accused persons, Abubakar Marshal, earlier told the court presided over by Justice Gideon Kurada, that El-Zakzaky was refused access to his doctors contrary to court order.El-Zakzaky and his wife were personally in court yesterday and were later returned to the Kaduna Correctional Centre. It was observed that the Kaduna metropolis was almost deserted following text messages that were circulated earlier that residents should be careful of their movement around the city.Several armed policemen were deployed to strategic areas with armored carriers to ward-off any attempt by Shiites to protest within the metropolis. The scenario, however, resulted to heavy traffic along the highway and major roads, as motorists were diverted to alternative routes.Meanwhile, Counsel to Kaduna State Government and Director of Public Prosecution, Dari Bayero, has said all grey areas had been resolved, as the court had ordered that El-Zakzaky and his wife be allowed access to their medical doctors. Bayero told journalists in an interview that there were some issues that arose in court, but all gray areas have been sorted out and the judge had ordered that the personal physicians to the defendants be allowed access to them. “Even if they want to go for scanning in any hospital, the Correctional Centre should provide security for them to be taken anywhere. The court said it can only trial sane and healthy defendants.“And since there are issues raised about their health, the court had adjourned so that they go and get the medical are they desire,” he added.
