The National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP), said it has rescued a victim of forced labour in Egypt.
The latest development follows the call by the Director General of NAPTIP, Dame Julie Okah-Donli, on leadership of the various regulatory bodies in the country to warn their members against aiding the trafficking of Nigerians for illicit purposes.
   
Recall that the Agency, had a few weeks ago, in partnership with the Nigerian Embassy in Beirut, rescued two Nigerians of Kwara State origin, who were victims of human trafficking from Lebanon. 
   
The lady (names withheld), was received by Officers of NAPTIP on January 30th, at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, at about 14:28hrs local time.  Okah-Donli while expressing her appreciation to the Ambassador and officials of the Nigerian Embassy in Cairo, re-emphasized her warnings to travel agents, labour recruiters and other nationals, who are now involved in the new wave of human trafficking especially to the Middle East to desist from such unlawful acts.
