 Mr. Tayo Oyetibo (SAN)  The lawyer, who spoke during an annual thanksgiving of his law firm in Lagos called on President Muhammadu Buhari and major stakeholders to rise up to the challenge and proffer urgent solution to assure the citizenry that the government cares about them. He also expressed worries over the rising state of poverty, saying , “It would seem that the Hobbesian state of “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short life” is staring at us presently.” According to him, the purpose of any government in any nation is to provide for the greatest happiness of the greatest number of the people. “It would be sheer political chicanery to say or even suggest that the greatest number of the people of Nigeria are happy with the current state of security in the country. “The government therefore needs to rise up to this challenge and find a solution to the problem as a matter of urgency so as to reassure the citizenry that the government cares for them,” he said. The senior advocate added that the present security breakdown is as a result of Nigeria’s sociological problems, which would require looking beyond the immediate incidences “but to find out what are the root causes.” Speaking on the thanksgiving, Oyetibo said, “It is a yearly programme scheduled to mark the commencement of our practice as a firm of Legal Practitioners that started in February 1991. The purpose of the thanksgiving day is to acknowledge the goodness and mercies of God to us as a corporate entity in the preceding year and to seek from Him greater goodness and mercies over us and our professional activities in the current year.” In his words of exhortation, a cleric, Pastor Isaac Ogbeide emphasised the need for the government to tackle frontally the issue of insecurity. He lamented that no society can develop where there is insecurity. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
