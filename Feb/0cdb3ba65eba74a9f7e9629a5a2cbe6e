Members of the Super Eagles Supporters Club have started mobilizing for Nigeria’s AFCON qualifier against Sierra Leone billed for Uyo… next month. • Lauds NFF/Nike over new jersey
Not ready to take chances, the leadership of the Super Eagles Supporters Club is mobilising its members in all the 36 states of the federation for the nation’s 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifiers against the Leone Stars of Sierra Leone. The match will hold on March 27 at the Akwa Ibom International Stadium, Uyo. President of the Super Eagles Supporters Club, Vincent Okumagba told The Guardian yesterday that they were mobilising all their state chapters to be in Uyo for the match. “Currently we are recruiting new members as we strive to increase our membership,” Okumagba said. “We have just launched our website www.sescng.org., where online registration is currently going on, and over 27,000 have registered so far. We are encouraging them to come and join us in supporting the Super Eagles to victory in Uyo.” The Super Eagles versus Leone Stars’ match was earlier scheduled to hold at the refurbished Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium in Benin City. According to Okumagba, the second edition of the Super Eagles Supporters Club awards is scheduled for June this year. Okumagba praised the NFF/Nike for the new jersey that was released last week, just as he hinted that the Club was also partnering with Haggai Sports for a befitting uniform for the Super Eagles Supporters Club. “These uniform and kits will be launched later this year.” He urged the NFF to renew the contract of Super Eagles coach Gernot Rohr saying the man has done well having seen Nigeria win the first two matches of the qualifiers so far both home and away.
