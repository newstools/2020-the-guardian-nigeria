James Bond – NO TIME TO DIE The new James Bond film “No Time to Die” has cancelled its Beijing premiere as well as a promotional tour with talent in April due to the coronavirus epidemic. Daniel Craig and the cast will not attend the Beijing screening or the subsequent publicity tour of China, which have been halted because of uncertainty surrounding the evolution of the epidemic. Cinemas across the world’s second-largest box office market remain shuttered indefinitely amid efforts to suppress the spreading of the disease. There is currently little clarity on when business may return to normal. The death toll in China now exceeds 1,600 people. In “No Time To Die” which is Craig’s last outing as the famous Agent 007, a retired Bond would come back into service to help in the search for a missing scientist. When it becomes apparent that the scientist was abducted, Bond must confront a danger the likes of which the world has never seen before. The film features Ralph Fiennes, Naomie Harris, Ben Whishaw, Rory Kinnear, Jeffrey Wright, Léa Seydoux, and Christoph Waltz reprise their roles from previous films. While Rami Malek plays the film’s villain.  The release date in North America is April 10, via MGM’s United Artists Releasing banner, with Universal Pictures International launching in the UK and select international territories on April 2. The last James Bond movie, Spectre, made $881M worldwide, with nearly $84M from China.
