However, one of the supporters took this far when he brought out his penis on the live show with BBC cameras catching the incident in question. The unnamed supporter was seen walking forward before he raised his jacket, pulled down his pants and shook his manhood ‘like a windmill’. A social media rumour emerged on Thursday claiming that the fan had been banned for life, with Aston Villa star Jack Grealish seemingly blasting that decision. But it is understood those are indeed false claims and there is yet to be any punishment for the fan in question. The police are not letting this slide as they are investigating “inappropriate actions” according to BBC news. The BBC in a statement, “We have been asked to assist the police in their efforts to identify the supporter in question and we will provide our full support.” When the game was ongoing, there were fears that the match might end in a draw when substitute Saint-Maximin sealed the victory with a stunning individual goal.
