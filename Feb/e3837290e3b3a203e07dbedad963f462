An FCT High Court in Abuja on Thursday sentenced one Obinna Echanu to death by hanging for killing an Uber driver, identified as Edwin Ali. Obinna was charged alongside one Everly Nnerun for allegedly conspiring to kill Ali on December 26th, 2016 along the Abuja airport road. Obinna and Nnerun were charged with armed robbery, illegal possession, conspiracy, of firearms and culpable homicide. Justice Peter Kekemeke, while delivering his judgment, discharged and acquitted Nnerun for lack of evidence by the Nigerian Police. Kekemeke, however, sentenced Echanu to death by hanging as his counsel failed to prove his innocence before the court.
