With a successful 2019 African Tour, which took place in Dakar, Lagos, and Douala, the much-anticipated Midem African Forum returns for the third edition with focus on the region’s music market. Midem’s 2020 African Forum is set to begin with a tour of two key African music cities – Lagos and Cape Town, slated to hold on February 25 and 28, 2020 respectively and culminate during the annual Midem Music Forum scheduled to hold from June 2 to 5, 2020 at Palais des Festivals Cannes, France. Last year’s forum, which took place at the Radisson Blu Hotel, Ikeja, Lagos, was themed, Charting a Course for the African Digital Market, saw music industry stakeholders, entertainment lawyers, talent managers and entertainers such as Waje, Wale Davies, Taiye Aliyu, Tosin Sorinola, Yemisi Falaye, Kelvin Orifa and Michael Ugwu in attendance. This year’s Lagos edition is set to take place at the Freeme Space, Nike Art Gallery Road, Lekki, Lagos from 10am, under the theme; The state of the Nigerian music industry today and its evolution from past years. How the industry copes with the main challenges it faces today and how to build a sustainable international career for African artistes. Afrobeat legend, Femi Kuti, will make his debut live performance at Midem during this year’s edition. An auspicious occasion, this will be the first concert of any Kuti Family member at Midem in its 54 years. Femi’s involvement in Midem’s initiatives in Africa, including the 3-day African Tour within the continent, and the African Music Forum in Cannes, for which he was Artist Ambassador in 2019, will mark his premiere on the Midem Beach. In addition to Femi, other iconic musicians have been Artist Ambassadors for the initiative over the past 3 years – Yemi Alade, Black Coffee, Davido and Maleek Berry. Midem Director, Alexandre Deniot said, “We are so happy to keep on building the relationship with Femi and to welcome his inaugural concert on the Midem Beach this year after his inspirational keynote in 2019. This is a reflection of our long-term approach to supporting Africa, African music and the region’s artists. We look forward to announcing more African talent within the Midem lineup soon.” The forum will see a panel discussion on changing the narrative of African Music on the global stage and the role of labels and the evolution of independent artists and labels in Africa. Also, there will be discussions around charting a course for the African digital market and the importance of data in applying new tools and perspectives for music in a digital world. Keynotes will be delivered by artiste managers Efe Ogbeni (Davido, Tiwa Savage) and Taiye Aliyu (Yemi Alade), while this year’s panelists will include Opeyemi Iredumare (MTN), Chinedu Chukwuji (COSON), Andrea Giaccaglia (PR & Digitrackar), Efe Omorogbe (Music Exec). There will also be masterclasses presented by Zach Fuller (MiDIA Research), Akinyemi Ayinoluwa (Hightower Solicitors) and a representative from Boomplay, and a question and answer session via Skype with Haitian rapper and musician, Wyclef Jean. The third edition of the Midem African Forum Lagos is in partnership with Boomplay and Trace TV and in collaboration with 6060 Music Group, Spotlight Management, and Cream Entertainment.
