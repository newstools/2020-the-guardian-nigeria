A Chief Magistratesâ€™ Court in Kafanchan, Kaduna State on Friday ordered that a 30-year-old tailor, Elijah Ewos, who allegedly defiled a 13-year-old girl, be remanded in a correctional facility. Ewos, a resident of Zonkwa, is charged with defilement contrary to Section 257 of the Kaduna State Penal Code Law, 2017. The presiding judge, Abdulaziz Ibrahim, however, did not take the plea of Ewo for a lack of jurisdiction to hear the matter. Ibrahim, who adjourned the matter until March 9, ordered that the case file be forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecution for legal advice. Earlier, the state counsel from the ministry of justice, Mathias Joseph, told the court that Ewos defiled the girl in his shop on Feb. 17. Joseph noted that the victim was taken to the Salama Sexual Assault Referral Centre in Kafanchan and the matter was referred to the Civil Defence for investigation.
