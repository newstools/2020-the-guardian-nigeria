The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has disclosed plans to improve its agenda to diversify the nation’s economy from the oil sector to the non-oil sector, through the launch of a set of policies, noting that it targets to achieve $12 billion in export trade by 2024.
 
The apex bank said it was putting everything in place, including the entire chain of export, to make sure it intervenes and gives all the necessary support from the beginning to the end of export to achieve its target.

You can see this from the amount of money that is being pumped into the manufacturing sector through various intervention funds and the new rules that say banks must lend to the real sector.”
