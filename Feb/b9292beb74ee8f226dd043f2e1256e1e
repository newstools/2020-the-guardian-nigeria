Yari The governorship candidate of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) in Zamfara State, Alhaji Sani Shinkafi, has described the decision of former state governor, Abdulaziz Yari, to challenge the Supreme Court’s verdict as a mockery of judiciary. Shinkafi also indicted the party leadership and its governorship candidate in Bayelsa State, David Lyon, for returning to the Supreme Court over the February 13 judgment that sacked him, stressing that both Zamfara and Bayelsa losses were self-inflicted. According to him, the party, in both cases, failed to either conduct a valid primary or present qualified candidates for the elections. Shinkafi said, “This is unconstitutional and it will, therefore, create a situation where there is no end to litigation in courts in Nigeria. This will make mockery of our hard-earned democracy and amounts to a national disgrace. “Both cases of Zamfara and Bayelsa States are self-inflicted injuries as the party in both cases, failed to either conduct a valid primary or field qualified candidates for the polls.” Yari had, last week, returned to the apex court with an application seeking a review of its judgment which had sacked Muktar Idris of the All Progressives Congress (APC) as the duly elected governor of the state.
