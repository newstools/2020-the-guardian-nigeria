The Minister of Environment, Dr. Mohammad Mahmood Abubakar, has said Nigeria is set to access a third tranche of the green bond programme of up to N25 billion to fund environmental projects.
   
This follows the country’s successful debut green bond issuance of N10.69 billion ($30 million) in December 2017, by which Nigeria became the first African country to issue a green bond, and N15 billion Series II Green Bond in 2019.
   
Green Bonds are any type of instrument where the proceeds are exclusively applied to finance or re-finance, in part or in full, new and/or existing eligible green projects that align with the four core components of the Green Bond Principles (GBP).
