Others likely to also be suspended are, Chukwuka Onyema, Ajibola Muraino, and Yakubu Barde. The House Committee on Ethics and Privileges is investigating them for allegedly parading themselves as leaders of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) caucus, a claim the party dismissed stating that the lawmakers could act in a leadership capacity. Reacting at the weekend, Chinda expressed the hope that Gbajabiamila would not succumb to pressures to suspend him for playing his role as leader of PDP caucus and given that he and the others have been discussing with the Speaker.
