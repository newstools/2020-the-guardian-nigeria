The general overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Pastor Enoch Adeboye will be 78 in March and ahead of the celebration, he is sharing seventy-eight quotes of inspiration and advice. However, it appears many are paying close attention to quote 19 which states: My sons, don’t marry a lady who cannot cook. She needs to know how to do chores and cook because you cannot afford to be eating out all the time. This has since stirred controversy online on whether or not the new generation should adhere strictly to this advice as ‘times have changed’. Recall in January, he took to Twitter to share some marriage advice which included instructing couples to ‘crush that crush’. However, one of his tweets that caught the attention of many users was that in which he revealed that he once asked his son to fire a secretary because the son told him that he is always excited to resume work every Monday because he gets to see the secretary. In response to his recent nineteenth quote, media personality said: When Pastor Adeboye says “my sons”, ask ya self are you a member of his flock? Are you his spiritual child, if no, why are you so bothered??? Let him advice his own, if it’s not for you, jump and pass my friends, I promise you won’t go to hell by facing your front. See more reactions to Pastor Adeboye’s quote below: Whether Pastor Adeboye said it or not, it's common sense to know how to cook as a man & it's also common sense to know how to cook as a woman. It's not advisable to marry anyone that can't cook, no be everytime chef & eatery. Stop dragging Pastor Adeboye, go & learn how to cook. — Zaddy Ajala (@UNCLE_AJALA) February 18, 2020  If u like, listen to Pastor Adeboye & don't learn how to cook bcos u're a man, u will die of hunger…I guarantee it. Remain there and be looking for a cook…it's not me u're doing dear, it's u. — Adunni Achebe (@Adunni_Achebe) February 18, 2020  Hello Sir, also teach your sons that cooking is not embedded in a woman’s vagina. Every damn human should know how to cook and do home chores. In marriage, a man will have to cook, clean, and wash. Teach your sons this too. A woman wasn’t born with kitechen, and washing machine. — 𝐒𝐨𝐥𝐨𝐦𝐨𝐧 𝐁𝐮𝐜𝐡𝐢 (@Solomon_Buchi) February 17, 2020  Guys taking list of girls that are dragging Pastor Adeboye and adding them to cannot cook WhatsApp group  pic.twitter.com/phlk26Ma3G — OGA Nelson (@theoga_nelson) February 18, 2020  Pastor Adeboye @PastorEAAdeboye spoke to we His children about the kind of wife we shld marry. Neighbours children are complaining. If He is your father, youd listen, if He is not, pls face your own father. It's stupid to eavesdrop my father's instructions to me and counter. — Thommie  (@iamthommie) February 18, 2020  Pastor Adeboye speak his truths according to the bible. If you are pressed about those things then you should channel your grievances towards the Bible. Simple. — Ayo FBI (@PureMinD__) February 18, 2020  Those dragging Pastor Adeboye for saying “don’t marry a woman that CAN’T cook” will not see this. Lmaaaaao y’all will be alright.
