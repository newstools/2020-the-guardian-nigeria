The former Senior Technical Adviser to the immediate Minister of State for Petroleum, Timothy Okon, has stated that a new regulation will be unveiled in June this year to address issues bordering on gas pricing, monopoly and licensing.
  
Okon at a gas interactive session with the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) Gas Group in Lagos, said the bill will also address structural issues in the industry.
  
Earlier, the Director General, MAN, Segun Kadir, represented by the Director, Corporate Communications, MAN, Ambrose Oruche, expressed deep concerns over the high price of gas offered to manufacturers in the country, saying the sector is already beset with myriads of challenges.  “We do not anticipate the government fixing the price of gas. It is not the role of the State, but what we expect is that commercially derived pricing arrangement such as the Export Parity Price (EPP) which is not set by government will form the basis of the pricing while the pricing formula will now be in the regulation.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
