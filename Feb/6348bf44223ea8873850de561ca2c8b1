The Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, has called on the contractors handling the dualisation of the Lokoja–Auchi-Benin Road, to ensure that motorists are not subjected to hardship. He spoke yesterday, while inspecting the road, and encouraged them to ensure that road users do not face difficulty while construction work is going on especially during the rainy season. At the Auchi–Ehor section, Fashola explained that the road was a source of discomfort to travellers especially during the last rainy season before emergency work was carried out during the Yuletide. Similarly, the Minister added that the 250 kilometres road is now being dualised, linking North to the South of the country, stressing that thorough work was being done on the road to achieve high quality. His words: “Some sections of the road had been completed others are at different stages. We think it is important to highlight the problem here for those who may ask: how long will it take to complete? “We have constructed the road to reduce accidents, which was a perennial problem in the area, and by so doing we can say that government has succeeded in saving lives and property.” The Minister also inspected 44 units apartment project in Benin, Edo State, built by the National Housing programme, saying that a sustainable process was being put in place for the sale of the houses.
