It appears Mase has a lot to say following Diddy’s speech at Clive Davis’ pre-Grammy gala airing out the Recording Academy for not taking rap and R&B music from black artists seriously. “Your past business practices knowingly has continued purposely starved your artist and been extremely unfair to the very same artist that helped u obtain that Icon Award on the iconic Badboy label,” he began. “For example, u still got my publishing from 24 years ago in which u gave me $20k. Which makes me never want to work w/ u as any artist wouldn’t.” Mase went on to say that he offered Diddy $2 million for his masters, but the business mogul wouldn’t budge unless he could surpass the “European guy’s” offer, even though Diddy only allegedly paid him $20,000 over two decades ago. This is not black excellence at all. When our own race is enslaving us. If it’s about us owning, it can’t be about us owning each other. No More Hiding Behind “Love”. U CHANGED? GIVE THE ARTIST BACK THEIR $$$. So they can take care of their families
