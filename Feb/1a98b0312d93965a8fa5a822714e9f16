Chan took to his website and social media pages on Thursday to debunk the rumours that he was infected and under quarantine. In a statement on his website, Chan said he is “safe and healthy”; “I’d like to take this opportunity to say “thank you” for everybody’s concern! I’m very healthy and safe, and haven’t been quarantined. I’ve received many messages from friends asking if I’m ok. Your love and concern is so heartwarming. Thank you!” The “Police Story” star also revealed that he has received lots of gifts, including face masks from concerned fans. “I’ve also received some very special gifts from fans all over the world during this very difficult time. Thank you for the face masks. Your thoughtfulness is well received! And I’ve asked my lovely staff to donate your kindness through official organisations to those who need it most.” Chan’s recent film, “Vanguard” was pulled due to concerns over the potential spread of the coronavirus in film theatres. The Straight Times in Singapore reported that earlier this month, Jackie Chan offered a $197,000 reward for the development of an antidote. “Science and technology is key to overcoming the virus, and I believe many people have the same thought as me and hope that an antidote can be developed as soon as possible,” Chan wrote on the Chinese social media platform Weibo.
