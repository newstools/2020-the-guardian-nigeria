Tax authorities and other critical stakeholders have said there is an urgent need to address some key issues in the Finance Act, as well as improve the tax system if the government must generate more revenue.
 
The submission was made during the Chartered Institute of Taxation of Nigeria (CITN) 2020 Business Luncheon, in Lagos, recently.
   
They noted that some of the issues that needed to be addressed include, multiple taxes, taxing Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), tax exemption for businesses, delay in Value Added Tax receipt issuance, Tax Identification Number (TIN), among others.  “The annual review will affect many businesses; it will amount to a lot of frustrations on business operators and companies and it will make multinational companies and foreign investors move away from Nigeria to invest in others climes.”
   
Also, Vice President, CITN, Adesina Adedayo, said there was the need for SMEs to have effective information exchange with tax authorities to guide decisions on taxing them.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
