To many people across the world, the fear of the deadly Coronavirus is the beginning of wisdom. The anxiety over the effects of the virus has hit social places in Nigeria such that many social and sports’ clubs have devised ways of protecting their members. One of such clubs is the Ikoyi Club 1938, which is one of the clubs that has openly displayed a banner warning members that might have been to China in the last 14 days to stay away from the club. “The medical sub-committee of Ikoyi Club 1938 hereby give notice that, in view of the recent outbreak of the Coronavirus in Wuhan, China, anybody who has been to China in the last 14 days, is kindly requested to stay away from the club for another period of 14 days as a public health precaution.“If you are without symptoms you are welcome back to the club but if you do display any symptoms during this period, kindly seek medical advice immediately”, the banner reads. The management placed the signpost at some strategic places within the premises of the club, just as its medical committee is closely watching the Asian members and visitors of the club.   Elsewhere, precisely in Oman where the Open Tournament is on-going, some players were barred from participating in the competition due to the fear of the virus. As reported by golfpunkhq.com, it was a worrying time for the European Tour as Italian golfers Edoardo Molinari and Lorenzo Gagli were quarantined in Muscat and originally forced to pull out of the Oman Open over fears they may have contracted the coronavirus. However, the pair will now play, partnering each other after Gagli’s test proved negative. Gagli had exhibited flu-like symptoms, and after an assessment by the tournament’s on-site medical team, in consultation with the Omani Ministry of Health, he underwent a test for Coronavirus (Covid-19) and immediately entered self-isolation as a precaution.Molinari, the older brother of former Open winner Francesco, Gagli’s roommate also went into isolation as a precautionary measure. Gagli was none too pleased with the original decision to quarantine him until next Wednesday.“It’s an inexplicable decision,” Gagli said. “If there were a risk of contagion, then they would have to isolate dozens of golfers and cancel the tournament.”Italy, which currently has the biggest outbreak of the virus in Europe, has reported 12 deaths and 400 confirmed cases. Authorities have attempted to lockdown the epicentre in the north to contain the spread of the virus. However, yesterday morning, the European Tour reported that the Omani Ministry of Health had confirmed that Gagli’s test results were negative and that they had reinstated both players into the Oman Open. The players have been added to the field and will tee-off together at 1:30 pm local time. Keith Pelley, Chief Executive of the European Tour, said: “This is a difficult global situation, one during which we will continue to follow all guidance given to us on preventive measures, and all decisions will continue to be made in the interests of overall public health. “We will also continue to work closely with our own health experts and local authorities to ensure we have the latest medical and travel advice for all our tournaments because the well-being of our players, staff and spectators remains the European Tour’s absolute priority.” These are difficult times for not just the golf world as many sports have been affected by the Coronavirus outbreak.
