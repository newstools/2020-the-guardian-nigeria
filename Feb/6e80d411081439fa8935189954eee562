Hollywood star Pamela Anderson and Jon Peters have split just 12 days after their wedding in Malibu on February 1. The couple seemingly did not file a legal marriage certificate. “I have been moved by the warm reception to Jon’s and my union,” Anderson, 52, said in a statement to CNN. “We would be very grateful for your support as we take some time apart to re-evaluate what we want from life and from one another.” Hollywoodlife reports that sources close to the couple said: “Pamela realized she rushed into things with Jon and initiated the split.” “She needed some time to think about everything as she realized she should’ve slowed down when first diving into things. The door isn’t closed forever, but she needs time to process what’s best for her and her life,” the insider also added.
