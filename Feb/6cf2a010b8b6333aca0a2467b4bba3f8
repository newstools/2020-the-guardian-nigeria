Nigeria’s transportation minister Rotimi Amaechi has refuted a report that claimed he narrowly escaped being attacked by kidnappers. “Hundreds of Abuja-Kaduna train passengers, including the minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, have escaped attack by kidnappers on Sunday evening,” an online news platform Daily Nigerian reported. The news website said it reliably gathered that the kidnappers laid in ambush around Mando area and attempted to waylay the passengers, who arrived at Rigasa train station around 8:15 pm. The report claimed that the kidnappers shot at the vehicles before the arrival of the police and soldiers. The report was based on a supposed eyewitness account. But Amaechi in a tweet described the report as “Fake News.” “This (the report) is completely concocted,” Amaechi said. But Nigerian activist Aisha Yesufu said some of her relatives were on the same train and saw the minister and his convoy flee when the attack happened. “My sister, my brother and my sister-in-law were in that train. When your convoy scattered and you fled like a new born mouse whom water have been poured on, it was witnessed,” Yesufu claimed. Amaechi in response to Yesufu insisted that he was not attacked.  “I did not see or escaped attackers, bandits or kidnappers,” Amaechi said. Presidential aide Bashir Amhad said he was in Kaduna with the minister but did not witness the reported attack. “Came to Kaduna last night together with HM Rotimi Amaechi for Gov. Nasir el-Rufai’s 60th birthday, people started calling us since before we left Rigasa station to find out if it’s true that we’re attacked, we told them WE’RE NOT, funny some people still insisting we’re attacked,” Ahmad tweeted. Efforts made to confirm the report from police proved abortive as calls and text messages sent to Kaduna State police spokesman Mohammed Jalige did not elicit any response.
