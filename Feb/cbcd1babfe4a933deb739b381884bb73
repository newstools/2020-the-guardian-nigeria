However, Prosper Otemuyiwa also known as Unicode is defying this stereotype. He walks in, clad in a crisp well-ironed native, he clarifies that it is a precaution against the constant misconception by the SARS arms of police operations, a misconception that young men in jean and carrying laptops are internet fraudsters [Yahoo boys.] Prosper Otemuyiwa is not your regular software developer. A guru in his field at only 26, Otemuyiwa proved his expertise at age 23 in 2016 when he beat Facebook to emerge second in the list of #PHP developers worldwide. What is more, he went ahead to co-found Eden Life Inc, a “tech-enabled service that puts your home’s chores on autopilot.” One would think that his decision to be a software developer was deliberate, however, he found his calling by chance.
While in school, he was not a fan of programming. In fact, he had a low grade in it. Bothered about the grade, he decided to give ample time to study the course and discovered how easy programming is. This had an unintended consequence. He became the crossword puzzle solver in programming and coding that his seniors and mates paid him to unravel the difficulties they encounter while programming. Programming will be his source of income. Successes come in leaps and bounds for those who work hard enough and Prosper has had his own share of recognitions and huge groundbreaking successes. He was a Google development expert for two years from 2010 to 2012 where he represented Google at events.
One would think with this breakthrough, there would be a road map in place for young developers. However, he explains that there are no set roadmaps for any developer, there are no rules set in stones.
He says, “Always have the beginner’s mindset because the moment you think you know it all, you discover that you know nothing and you remain junior and you will not realise until you get to a new place. Always be in the company of senior developers, it is better to stand on the shoulder of giants.” Hence, there are no roadmaps other than learning from people who are on a higher pedestal and doing things that are worthy in society. He has further proven that it is possible to be different things at the same time, the basic thing is knowing how to balance these life choices. At Eden Life Inc, a company based on sustainable living, he has mastered the art of being a co-founder, a software developer, while being a mentor to others. When asked about how he has successfully managed all responsibilities, he answers, “it has been challenging but it is good so far.” He adds that efficient time management, division of labour and dedication are important. This also translates to his life’s ethics. He works while traveling, and gives people the benefit of doubt by making them work on his personal projects. “It is just efficient time management, concerning conferences and travelings, the good thing about coding is that you can do it anytime. I can be on the plane and be coding, I can code during layovers. You have to be dedicated and you can also allow people to do some of these things, allow them to step up, you don’t have to do it all yourself.” However, there are moments as a developer where he gets stuck and he has to start all over again. “There are times you get stuck and after some time when you come back to it, you have to start all over again because you totally do not understand what next to do, there are times you need to call someone else to look into what you are doing, so as to fix it.” Taking a peep into the lessons he has learnt from his past mistakes,… …Grab a copy of The Guardian Life Magazine to read more on this…
