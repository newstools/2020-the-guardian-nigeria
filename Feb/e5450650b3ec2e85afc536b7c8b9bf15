This is the time for relevant stakeholders to intervene to save the lives of young Nigerians. “End-stage liver disease like cirrhosis that could benefit from liver transplantation is becoming quite common. This is the time for relevant stakeholders to intervene to save young Nigerians.” The ex-Chief Medical Director (CMD) of the University of Calabar Teaching Hospital (UCTH) advised the most populous black nation to champion the development of a specialty to tackle the scourge in West Africa. Also speaking, president of the International Hepato-Pancreato-Billary-Association (IHPBA), Professor Martin Smith, commended the inauguration of the Nigeria chapter, promising to support the body in achieving its mission. The chapter was birthed after an advanced course, “Improving the Standard of Care in Hepato-pancreato-biliary Surgery in Nigeria”, ran by a foreign faculty and facilitated by IHPBA. The organisation is devoted to the amelioration of human suffering caused by hepato-pancreato-biliary disorders by improving education, training, innovation and patient care globally.
