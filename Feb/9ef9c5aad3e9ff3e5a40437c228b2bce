A state high court sitting in Niger state on Tuesday acquitted a former governor of Niger State Muâ€™azu Aliyu and two others of an alleged N1.940b money laundering case. The court ruled that the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) did not show diligence in prosecuting the case brought against Aliyu. The court said the prosecution counsel was not present and did not send any representative during the hearing of the case which led to three adjournments. Counsel to the defendant urged the court to discharge and acquit the defendant due to the failure of the prosecution to pursue the case properly. In his response, the counsel to the defendant insisted that the prosecution should equally declare it had similarly withdrawn its case. The prosecution told the court that he is withdrawing the case before the judge, Justice Mikailu Abdullahi, discharged and acquitted the defendants for lack of diligent prosecution by the EFCC.
