Stakeholders will today gather at the Africa Union Headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, to consider actions to accelerate the implementation of impactful delivery of gender equality and women’s empowerment initiatives. Founder-President, Wellbeing Foundation Africa, Toyin Saraki, representatives from private sector and senior women leaders will join the United Nations (UN) Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, and Heads of States, at the African Union High-Level Meeting on Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment. Ahead of the meeting, Saraki has received a commendation from the Special Envoy of the Chairperson of the African Union Commission on Women, Peace and Security, Mme Bineta Diop, for her commitment and leadership in the advancement of gender equality and women empowerment. Saraki, who was integral to the conception and launch of the Nigeria Chapter of the African Women Leaders Network (AWLN) last year, expressed happiness that the meeting will afford stakeholders the opportunity to officially launch the African Women Leadership Fund (AWLF) led by the AUC, and the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), as part of the flagship initiatives of the African Women Leaders Network (AWLN). She is expected to join the Corporate Council on Africa (CCA) for their Business Breakfast and Roundtable on Combating Hepatitis in Africa, which will launch a political declaration to combat hepatitis. Saraki said: “It is critical that we are able to create this effective platform for leaders across governments and the private sector to collaborate and utilise opportunities to eliminate hepatitis in Africa. “The broader theme of the 33rd Ordinary Session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the African Union, “Silencing the Guns: Creating
Conducive Conditions for Africa’s Development,” demonstrates that peace and stability are the foundations of progress. There can never be health for all, or proper political representation for women, without peace.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
