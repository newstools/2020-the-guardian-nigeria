The Weeknd – After Hours Album | Photo: Instagram/The Weeknd The Weeknd’s highly-anticipated album After Hours now has a release date. In addition to this good news, the Canadian R&B singer, real name Abel Tesfaye, has gifted fans with the release of the title track. The award-winning singer has been busy in recent days, dropping the album title, sharing its grisly artwork and releasing the six-minute “After Hours,” which arrived at midnight. “After Hours” is a moody, slow-burner that manages to capture the sound of a city in the dark, wee hours. On it, he sings: “My darkest hours/ Girl, I felt so alone inside of this crowded room/ Different girls on the floor, distractin’ my thoughts of you/ I turned into the man I used to be, to be/ Put myself to sleep/ Just so I can get closer to you inside my dreams/ Didn’t wanna wake up ‘less you were beside me/ I just wanted to call you and say, and say.” The forthcoming album which will be The Weeknd’s fourth studio set is due out March 20. It’ll include the previously-released tracks “Heartless” and “Blinding Lights,” which currently leads the singles charts in Australia and the U.K., his first chart-topper in that market. After Hours is the followup to 2016’s multiplatinum Starboy, which topped the Billboard 200 albums chart. His sophomore album Beauty Behind the Madness from 2015 also led the survey.
