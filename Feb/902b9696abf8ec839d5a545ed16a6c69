Nigerian’s on Twitter have reacted to the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed’s request for a $500m to digitalize the Nigerian Television Authority (NTA) to enable it compete with big players in media industry globally. The minister has sought the Nigeria Senate committee for Local and Foreign Loans for a sum of $500m out of President Muhammadu Buhari’s $29.96b loan request for funding critical infrastructure in the country. Mohammed explained that if the fund was approved, the NTA could be upgraded to enable it to send out signals that would be at par with CNN, “because we have the manpower and the technology.” The government-owned boasts of having the largest network in the country. But the ever-vocal Nigerian Twitter said the minister’s plan is just another pipe dream. Lai Mohammed should fear God. Haba! $500m(N180bn) can build 10 world-class cancer hospitals. It can create at least 25,000 SMEs that will improve the lives of at least 5m families. Why does he need a loan of $500m(N180bn) to digitize NTA. What concerns you and I with NTA? — the Morris Monye factor (@Morris_Monye) February 5, 2020  Alhaji Lai Mohammed is about to loot $500 million.
NTA can never be better than any private TV station with the current crop of Workers.
They’re grossly incompetent, even with $2billion it would still be a waste.
Many of them got the job through backdoors.pic.twitter.com/nxy9NJpsMC — Anambra 1st son (@UchePOkoye) February 10, 2020  Lai Mohammed requested $500m loan to transform Nigerian Television Authority (NTA) to Cable News Network (CNN)?
