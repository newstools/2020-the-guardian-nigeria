Nigerian’s on Twitter have reacted to the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed’s request for a $500m to digitalize the Nigerian Television Authority (NTA) to enable it compete with big players in media industry globally. The minister has sought the Nigeria Senate committee for Local and Foreign Loans for a sum of $500m out of President Muhammadu Buhari’s $29.96b loan request for funding critical infrastructure in the country. Mohammed explained that if the fund was approved, the NTA could be upgraded to enable it to send out signals that would be at par with CNN, “because we have the manpower and the technology.” The government-owned boasts of having the largest network in the country. But the ever-vocal Nigerian Twitter said the minister’s plan is just another pipe dream.   To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
