• Claims 35M Nigerians lack access to telephony services The Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive (EVC/CE), Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), Prof. Umar Danbatta, has said telecommunications remains the best enabler in expanding the frontiers of financial inclusion in Nigeria.
   
Danbatta affirmed this on Wednesday, in Abuja, when he received a team from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF), and its consultants, Glenbrooks Partners, who visited the Commission to explore opportunities for collaboration and partnership to enhance financial inclusion nationwide.  Also speaking, another member of the delegation, Elizabeth Mcquerry of Glenbrook Partners, commended the Federal Government’s commitment to expanding access to digital resources, and expressed the hope that this will trickle down to find implementation among all its agencies. Mcquerry, in company of her colleagues, Ifeanyi Monye and Charles Ifedi, equally appealed to all stakeholders to work in synergy to ensure increased access and affordability of digital and financial services by “people at the bottom of the bottom of the pyramid.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
