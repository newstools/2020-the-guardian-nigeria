In a Valentine’s day message published on her YouTube page, the actress admonished single ladies in a relationship married men to play smart and “cash out”: “If you are a side chic to a married man, Girl, you are better be cashing out. Secure the bag, get that dough, get that money because that man isn’t yours. Sis, he isn’t yours. He belongs to another woman so please it had better be worth it. Don’t go and collect chocolate and flowers as gifts from a married man oh. “If you do, your head needs to be examined. If you are dating a married man, chop his money, collect his money because that man is already married. So stupid girls will be dating a married man will be doing love…sis he is not yours. He belongs to another woman so use your brain”  The actress had earlier stated in a video on her YouTube channel that marriage is overrated: “Our mothers brought us up, as women, to take whatever our partners do to us. They tell us to take it because we want to remain in a man’s house. To me, it is not an achievement. Let’s just say as it is– marriage is overrated. It takes two people to make it work; it’s not just about the women. But, everybody keeps heaping all the responsibilities on the woman. That shouldn’t be.” Aigbe separated from her husband, Lanre Gentry, in 2018, amidst allegations of domestic violence. Mercy Aigbe who is best known for her Yoruba indigenous films hails from Benin city in Edo State.
