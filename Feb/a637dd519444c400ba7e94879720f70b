These days, there are newer and more exciting styles to rocking your natural hair, so you don’t have to opt to weave your hair to keep it tamed.
One of these popular natural hairstyles is the ‘High Messy Ponytail Bun.’ The bun is a trendy day look among natural hair wearers not only because it gives the African chic look. It is a perfect hairstyle for all occasions; formal or informal. The bun is a preferred choice by many naturalistas, and even your favourite black celebrities opt for this look to the red carpet. Making the High Messy Ponytail Bun is very easy and doesn’t require a lot of products. There are two options to creating this look, hair extensions for short hair and natural hair for long hair or a braided bun. Here is a step-by-step guide to making this adorable hairstyle: The High Messy Ponytail Bun Using Natural Hair
For long-haired naturalistas, you can make this style without hair extensions, or use extensions for a fuller look. The key to getting this right is to ensure your hair is moist enough to prevent breakage, and it also adds to the overall look.
To achieve this look, you would need water in a spray bottle, a natural hair styling gel, hair bands, and a wide-tooth comb. You would also need a hairbrush, bobby pins, toothbrush, leave-in conditioner, and a satin scarf. The first step is to moisturise your hair using water mixed with leave-in conditioner and use your hand to detangle your hair. Use a wide-tooth comb to comb your hair upwards and apply the styling gel to the front and back edges of your hair to keep it silky. Brush your hair into a ponytail using a hairbrush and pack your bun tightly with a hairband. Use the bobby pins to tuck in stray hair strands. The final step is to lay your edges, taking time to swoop each little strand. Finally, wrap a satin scarf around your hair until your gel dries up for a neater and long-lasting outcome. The High Messy Ponytail Bun with Weaves
This ponytail bun is for short-haired naturalists who want to achieve a fuller looking bun. Long-haired naturalistas can also try this look to complement their natural bun by adding more fullness.
For this, you would need water in a spray bottle, a natural hair styling gel, hair bands, a wide-tooth comb, a weave. You would also need a hairbrush, bobby pins, toothbrush, leave-in conditioner, and a satin scarf. Moisturise your hair and detangle with your fingers before you begin. Next, comb your hair upwards and pack your hair into a ponytail tightly with a hairband. Attach your weave to your bun and roll in a doughnut pattern.
Use bobby pins to tuck in stray strands and apply more styling gel to your hair, then use a toothbrush to lay your edges. You can also opt to use a long weave or braided attachment to give more flair to your ponytail. Ladies with Low-cut Hair
The length of your hair doesn’t affect your natural bun as even ladies with their hair cut low can achieve the messy ponytail bun. It is only a tad bit tricker.
To achieve the messy bun while on low-cut, you would need to style your hair down until you can pack just the middle of your hair. Next, carefully apply your weave onto your hair, making sure to hold it tightly in places with hair bands. Styling into a doughnut might be a lot harder, so opt to leave the weave down instead. The messy bun is an everyday look that can be achieved stress-free and at very low costs. Regardless of what length your hair is at, you can achieve the natural bun, you might need a weave if your hair is short. This hair is a protective hairstyle that would keep your hair from breaking while you look as cute as cute can be.
This hairstyle can be done from the comfort of your home at no extra costs.
