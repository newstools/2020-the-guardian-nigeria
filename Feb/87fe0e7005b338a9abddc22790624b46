Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike has charged the judiciary not to be intimidated by other arms of government, but to always dispense justice according to the law. The governor also pointed out that executive and legislative arms of government are far more corrupt than the Judiciary, decrying that the above arms criticise the Judiciary all the time. Wike added that he Judiciary remains vital to the sustenance of democracy, regretting that sometimes, people are afraid to dispense justice because of intimidation. He stated this during a courtesy visit by the President of the Court of Appeal, Justice Zainab Bulkachuwa, at the Government House, Port Harcourt. “The most corrupt arms of Government are the Executive and Legislative Arms. When they say that the Judiciary is corrupt, I laugh. The pressure on the Judiciary is from the Executive and Legislative arms.  The people who initiate the process are the ones who are corrupt.” The governor regretted that the Judges have allowed themselves to be boxed to a corner by the Executive and the Legislative Arms each time they fail to rise up to the occasion, saying, “The Judiciary must stand up to say that enough is enough. If you don’t stand up, then this democracy is in danger. “You are the ones to decide what is right or wrong. Never allow anyone to intimidate you.  The moment you take the oath of office, dispense Justice according to the law. “People are afraid to dispense justice because of intimidation. In some cases, they use the EFCC to intimidate Judges. Whether or not you do your work, they will come after you. Without the Judiciary, there will be no democracy.” Wike said that as a result of calculated intimidation, the Judiciary is afraid to relate with state governments to get support that will enhance the administration of justice.
