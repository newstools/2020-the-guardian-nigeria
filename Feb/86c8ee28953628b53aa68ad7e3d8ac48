The Guardian gathered that the fire, which lasted several hours without any intervention from the Fire Service men, also affected the nearby Orlu Council Secretariat. The inferno destroyed the commission’s sensitive documents and properties running into millions of Naira. Confirming the incident, the INEC state Public Relations Officer, Emmanuella Oparah said the inferno completely razed the entire office to ashes. She disclosed that the Commission has reported the incident to the necessary quarters including the police for investigations. When contacted, the police spokesperson in the state, Orlando Ikeokwu, said that the state Commissioner of Police, Bolaji Fafowora had ordered an investigation into the incident. The Ikeokwu said “I can confirm the incident to you but the cause of fire outbreak is unknown for now. “The state Commissioner of Police has dispatched the operatives to the scene of the incident with the view of ascertaining the root cause of the fire on the building.” It could be recalled that the incident came barely a week some alleged political thugs invaded the same INEC office and stopped the collation process during the supplementary election in Orlu/Orsu/Oru East federal constituency after tearing the result sheets.
