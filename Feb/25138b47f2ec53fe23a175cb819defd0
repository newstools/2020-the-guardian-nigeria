Dressed in a multi-coloured shirt and flanked by military personnel, Lyon was seen in pictures having his pre-swearing-in exercise on the parade ground. Lyon was seen in all-smiles waving at supporters who cheered him. The Supreme Court on Thursday nullified the election of Bayelsa State governor-elect David Lyon and his deputy-elect Biobarakuma Degi-Eremienyo, a day before their swearing-in on Friday, February 14. The court said Degi-Eremienyo, who was Lyon’s running mate in the election, forged the certificate he presented to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). The court ordered INEC to issue a certificate of return to the Peoples Democratic Party’s candidate Senator Douye Diri who came second in the election. Early in the year, Lyon, who was yet to be sworn in as Bayelsa State governor, said he had been awarded Nigeria’s best performing governor for 2019. Although Lyon did not mention the organisation that awarded him but attributed the award to ‘God’. “I am not even used to receiving awards,” Lyon said while his supporters celebrated his acclaimed feat with applauses. “This will not be the first and it will not be the last.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
