The Nigerian Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has dispelled rumors of importation of the deadly coronavirus to Nigeria. In a statement yesterday in Abuja, NCDC noted that the individual in question returned from China  last week and went for a routine medical test as requested by his employers. According to the center, the unnamed individual showed no symptoms of illness and has not been diagnosed with the coronavirus. Noted that NCDC agreed on a national case definition to identify suspected cases and established a laboratory  testing platform  to rest samples from patients who met case definition. He urged Nigerians to disregard the rumors and discourag it from further spreading as NCDC, Port Health Services and state Epidemiologist are aware of the processes for case identification and confirmation and will investigate every suspect case to ensure that Nigerians are safe. NCDC advised travellers from China to Nigeria in the last 14 days to report immediately to the center through its communication Centre.
