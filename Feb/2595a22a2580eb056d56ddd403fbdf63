Former Super Eagles left-back Mutiu Adegoke hopes that Arsenal youngster Bukayo Saka can still represent Nigeria in the future.There have been clarion calls by some Nigerian fans for Saka to be capped for the Nigerian national team as the England U-19 international could be included in the England’s squad for their international matches same month. Saka, whose father is from the Yoruba has become arguably Arsenal’s most impressive player of late with nine assists and three goals in all competitions for the Gunners has been tipped to represent England as he declared that no formal channel of communication has been established with the Nigeria Football Federation. “I think the German knows what he is doing. I believe the young lad would have his time definitely,” Adegoke who had three caps for Nigeria told allnigeriasoccer.com yesterday. “My take on that, Bukayo has to decide which country he wants to play for; England or Nigeria.“And again most players that have advantage of playing in England from tender age, would be dreaming of playing for England because we all know there’s no pension for former national team players in Nigeria. They get the advantage with England national team,” Adegoke, a former Shooting Stars and Dolphins FC defender stated. Speaking further, Adegoke said that Saka could play at the left back position and in left wing role saying: “It is good to be versatile. It won’t be a bad situation. I was once playing as a midfielder before playing as left-back. We do need his versatility and goal threat for Nigeria. This boy is good. He will offer competition to our current players in his positions,” Adegoke stated.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
