Indeed, social partners in the labour force have canvassed the need for Africans to owe themselves the duty of pulling together by the bootstraps and attending to the work of creating sustainable jobs and meaningful living for its people.  According to him, the wages of workers underlined the purchasing power in any clime, as it is a major driver for productivity and growth. Wabba, who spoke on the theme, “Towards the Social Economic Transformation of Africa Through Job Creation,” maintained that wages in Africa are the poorest around the world, stressing that for a continent that is endowed with enormous mineral and human resource, “this is totally unacceptable. “It is sad that while other regions have deservedly elevated the wage discourse to decent and living wages, many African governments and employers still see minimum wage as some sort of lottery for workers. Workers all over Africa demand for wage justice.”
 
Wabba, who is also the President, Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), said to create sustainable jobs for Africa’s teeming youth, African governments must create an enabling environment for businesses to thrive.  ILO Assistant Director-General and Regional Director for Africa, Cynthia Samuel-Olonjuwon, said for Africa to achieve the needed transformation, there is the need for a major shift and crucial role by social partners in fostering the initiative, with targeted policies to ensure economic growth, which translates into better welfare.
