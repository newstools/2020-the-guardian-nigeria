 Brazilian football player Neymar of Paris St Germain poses as he arrives at an after show party following the launch event for the new Capsule Collection Neymar Jr. by Replay in Duesseldorf, Germany, February 13, 2020. REUTERS/Thilo Schmuelgen  The world’s most expensive player has been struggling with a rib problem but was expected to be fit in time for the game at Signal Iduna Park. The Brazilian missed last season’s surprise last-16 loss to Manchester United with a foot injury, while he also sat out the second leg of the defeat at the same stage of the competition by Real Madrid in 2018. Neymar was rested, along with Kylian Mbappe, for PSG’s remarkable 4-4 draw at Amiens in Ligue 1 on Saturday. “He will be in Dortmund, I’m sure of it, but without being in the best shape he was in two weeks ago,” Tuchel said before the Amiens game. “But he will help us. I am sure and convinced of that.” PSG are yet to reach the Champions League semi-finals since being bought by their Qatari owners in 2011, with their run to the last four in 1994-95 still the closest they have come to lifting the European Cup.
