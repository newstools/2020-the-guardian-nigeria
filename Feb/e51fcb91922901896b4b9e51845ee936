Efficient implementation of the Finance Act requires the support of all stakeholders, and ensuring that accounting and tax records are adequately kept by their clients and payments are made in good time.
   
Addressing participants at a Tax Breakfast Seminar: 2020 National Budget and Finance Act, organised by KPMG Nigeria, in Lagos, at the weekend, the Executive Chairman, Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), Muhammad Mani, said tax plays a vital role in providing the required revenue for the provision of critical infrastructure in a nation. He pointed out that Nigeria has witnessed poor tax performance over the years, which he attributed to tax administrative procedure, centred mostly on enforcement.  He said the nation’s tax-to-GDP ratio in 2018 stood at 6.39 per cent, noting that the figure is far behind its peers in other emerging economies. He added that the FIRS is poised to rebuilding an institution that is capable of delivering efficient services to tax payers as well as optimising tax collection to adequately fund government projects.
   
Speaking at a panel session, the Chief Executive Officer, Seplat Petroleum Development Company Plc, Austin Avuru, maintained that unless Nigeria imbibes a flexible tax regime, the country would continue to face problems in tax administration. Avuru pointed out that investments are lacking in the traditional basin segment, which has contributed to failure on the part of the oil sector to meet up with yearly projections.
