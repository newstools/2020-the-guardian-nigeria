 World School Games In Dubai  The football matches saw the girls’ team fight very hard for the top spot but came in third in their group and second in their tier. They put up a good fight and all the LPSS athletes beat their personal best records at the games. In their usual practice, the whole school community came out to see the team off and welcomed them back to school on their return. According to Head Teacher of LPSS, Stephen Sibthorpe, “This tradition is important partly because it boosts the confidence of the team, but also because it encourages other students to aspire to be school ambassadors. The spirit of camaraderie is encouraged at LPSS, so our students become adults who identify positively and express loyalty to their primary environment.” However, plans are already underway for the 2021 games in Dubai and the first step is usually through the school’s sports’ day, which will be held on February 13, 2020. According to Coach/Director of Sports at LPSS, Yusuf Ojeyinka, “Our sports day is a chance for us to identify new talent, especially amongst students who may have joined the school recently.” At the yearly event, every child is given the opportunity to take part in one or more sports and students, who show potential are either co-opted into the school squad or begin training in the junior squad, he said. He added that the training prepares the students for future competitions but more importantly, for their own personal development in an area they are gifted in. “This is in line with the school’s vision to be a learning environment where every child achieves their maximum potential.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
