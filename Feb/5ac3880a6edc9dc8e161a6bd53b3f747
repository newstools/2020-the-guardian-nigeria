Despite the ban placed on rally in Edo State, the All Progressives Congress (APC), yesterday, at Opoji, Esan West Local Government held a rally to receive high profile politicians from other political parties, including former Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) political heavyweights, Prince Tony Omoaghe, Frank Erewele and Arc. Clifford Inegbedion. Addressing the defectors, APC factional Chairman, Col. David Imuse said politics is a game of numbers, and that the more people, the better the chances of winning election. He noted that the party would win the forthcoming gubernatorial election, reason for the commitment and efforts to win back more supporters ahead of the election in the state. Imuse expressed disappointment over the attacks on APC members opposed to the re-election of Governor Godwin Obaseki. He said Barr. Anslem Ojezua, factional Chairman of the state chapter of the party failed to operate by the constitutional provisions of the party, culminating in his removal. Top echelon of the party and APC governorship aspirants at the rally include, Engr Chris Ogiemwonyi, Maj. General Charles Airhiavbere, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, and Dr. Pius Odubu, the immediate past deputy governor. Special Adviser to the Governor on Media and Communication Strategy, Crusoe Osagie in a statement 24 hours to the rally warned that unauthorised rallies must not be held in any part of the state.
