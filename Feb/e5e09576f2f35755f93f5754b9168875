L-R; Pamela Anderson, Jon Peters | Photo: Page Six New twists to the Pamela Anderson and Jon Peters failed marriage is beginning to come to light. The Canadian-American actress’s ex-husband has claimed he paid off her $200,000 debts and bought her a new wardrobe during their 12-day marriage. In a now published email to a news outlet, Page Six, “Everything she told you was a lie” while further stating that he is ‘an old fool’. ‘I welcomed her into my life with open arms and love since I have looked after her for many years,’ he wrote. ‘I paid [her] bills since she was broke. I bought her a completely new wardrobe. Refuting claims he had asked the Baywatch star to be his wife, he instead claimed the 52-year-old proposed to him – via text. ‘When she texted me that she wanted to get married, it was kind of a dream come true even though I was engaged to someone else and the lady was moving in. ‘I dropped everything for Pam. She had almost $200,000 in bills and no way to pay it so I paid it and this is the thanks I get. There’s no fool like an old fool.’ However, Anderson’s representatives called Peters’ claims ‘ludicrous’. Anderson who has been married on five different occasions, got married to the 74-year-old Hollywood mogul in a private ceremony in Malibu on January 20. The pair, who first dated for more than 30 years ago announced their split just 12 days after their wedding. This comes days after it was revealed that Peters ended his ‘beautiful amazing love fest’ with Anderson via text message.
