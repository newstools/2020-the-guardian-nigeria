The yet-to-be-titled show will be co-produced by audio giant iHeartMedia, which produces original content such as Will Ferrell’s “The Ron Burgundy Podcast.” It was Clinton’s recent experience with two other famous interviewers that influenced the kind of show she wanted to create. Last fall, Clinton and her daughter Chelsea recorded an episode of Conan O’Brien’s audio show, “Conan O’Brien Needs a Friend” where they were promoting The Book of Gutsy Women, their co-authored collection of stories about women who have inspired them. Clinton was struck by how different the hourlong conversation with O’Brien was compared with short promotional segments on TV and radio. Clinton’s show will feature her in conversation with a brand-name guest, who might be drawn from world leaders and politicians, but also celebrities, authors and perhaps famous chefs. Her team is experimenting with using a Stern-inspired ensemble plucked from the larger universe of Hillaryland to help loosen her up, keep the show conversational, and discuss the day’s news, perhaps at the top or bottom of the show. Furthermore, Hillary Clinton wants the main guests to be defined by the theme of her most recent book. The person close to her described the ideal interview for the show as “a meeting of the minds with people of grit and determination.” Another focus of the show for Clinton is to use the podcast to share good news about problems that are actually being solved. hen asked how she’s been preparing, the person close to her said, “She’s been listening to a lot of podcasts.”
