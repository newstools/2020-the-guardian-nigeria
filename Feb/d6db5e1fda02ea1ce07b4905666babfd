A non-governmental organisation, Giving.ng has partnered with Leah Foundation to create awareness on cancer as part of activities to commemorate this year’s World Cancer Day. Speaking at a press conference to mark the World Cancer Day, in Lagos, Project Manager, Giving.ng, Mrs. Olapeju Ibekwe, said the group partnered the foundation to fight cancer because the disease has become a scourge that is killing people daily. “We are calling on every Nigerian to do something about how to roll back the cancer scourge by donating any amount of money through the platform. Donations received would be used to provide free screening for 5, 000 women in partnership with Leah Foundation,” she said. She said the crowdfunding platform is focused on raising funds with local and international partners to deal with various issues that are affecting the Nigerian society. This year’s celebration marks the midway point in the three-year plan of the “I Am, and I Will’ campaign of the World Cancer Day, which is an empowering call-to-action urging for personal commitment and represents the power of individual action taken now to impact the future. Executive Director, Leah Foundation, Mr. Lanre Bello, said the foundation had been in the forefront of efforts to control and eradicate some types of cancer through vaccination, stressing that if serious efforts were made, certain types of cancers could be eliminated in 20 years.
