Despite the full year 2019 results being churned out by quoted companies, the equities market began the month of February on a bearish note amid weak investors’ sentiments, as market capitalisation slumped by N160 billion.
   
Yesterday, the All-Share Index (ASI), shed 310.13 absolute points, representing a dip of 1.08 percent to close at 28,533.40 points. Similarly, market capitalisation lost N160 billion to close at N14.697 trillion.
   
The downtrend was impacted by losses recorded in large and medium value stocks, amongst which were; Forte Oil, Julius Berger, Cadbury Nigeria, Zenith Bank, and Access Bank.	Analysts at Afrinvest Limited, said: “For the rest of the week, we expect corporate earnings release to dictate the direction of the equities market.”  Honeywell Flour Mills followed with 9.28 percent to close at N1.06, and UPDC Real Estate Investment Trust added 8.06 percent to close at N3.35, per share.
