Efforts to find a lasting solution to escalating security challenges facing the country reverberated again yesterday as Osun State Governor Gboyega Oyetola urged holistic approach in the quest to enthrone peace in the society. He said traditional rulers occupy vintage position due to their closeness to the grassroots, urging security agents and other stakeholders to partner them to achieve the desired result in the fight against insecurity. Oyetola stated this yesterday at the “National Summit on Security and (In)security in Nigeria: The Role of Traditional institutions held at Ulli Beier Hall, Centre for Black Culture and International Understanding (CBCIU), Osogbo, Osun State. This came as the Sultan of Sokoto, Muhammad Sa’ad Abubakar III and his counterpart, the Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi, the Chairman and Co-Chairman of the National Council of Traditional Rulers of Nigeria respectively, asked the government and the citizens to show commitment to peace and unity of the Nigerian state. The duo, in their separate remarks at the forum, also pledged the readiness of the traditional rulers to collaborate with the government in combating the scourge of insecurity in Nigeria. Oyetola said for the country to overcome the menace, security agencies must collaborate with the traditional rulers, sensitise and encourage their subjects to provide the needed intelligence and expose criminals in their areas. He said: “Osun State holds traditional rulers in high esteem as the embodiments and custodians of our culture, tradition and our Omoluabi ethos which make us tick.” The Ooni, in his speech, expressed the readiness of the traditional rulers to partner with the government in strengthening security in the country, just as he reiterated the commitment of the monarchs to ensuring a united Nigeria.He said the situation in the society required good leadership and commitment as panacea for ensuring a sustainable peace in the country. The monarch said the formation of the South-West Security Network, code-named Amotekun, was not an attempt by governors in the zone to secede but an initiative to combat insecurity and secure lives and property of the people. He, however, noted that more creative and fresh strategies must be applied to stem the tide of insecurity. The Sultan said the leadership must do the needful if the country is to win war against terrorism, banditry and kidnapping and install peace and stability in the country.He said Nigerians should speak the truth and be prepared to stand by the truth at all times not minding the consequences as a sacrifice to enjoy a better society. He noted that his presence at the summit indicated what he stood.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
