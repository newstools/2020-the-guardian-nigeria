In just a few days, citizens of Edo State will go to the polls to elect a governor from among the 14 candidates that are contesting on different political platforms. But Edo voters are worried whether their votes would count on account of the tension and drums of violence being beaten in the lead up to election day. Concerned citizens and political stakeholders across the country believe that the exercise would test the integrity of President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and various security agencies with respect to how free, fair and credible the polls would be, which the administration promised when it came to power in 2015.  According to him, “It is important that enough security agents should be deployed to the base of the incumbent and his major opponent. The same should be done in the deputy governor’s base as well as that of Oshiomhole, because there is evidence in the last few days that those areas would be volatile and those are the places one would be expecting that thugs and hooligans loyal to various political godfathers would perpetrate ballot stuffing among other election malpractices.”  “We need an unbiased security agent and federal government’s presence in Edo on Saturday to get a free, fair and credible election,” Oki said.
  
On the possibility that the power of incumbency may likely be deployed Obaseki, Oki said, “If there is any power of incumbency, it is the federal government, and if there is also federal might, the central government controls necessary apparatus that are deployable and not the incumbent governor.”
 
On the chances of the two major candidates at the poll, Oki said while it appears that the APC candidate is coming behind, he said Ize-Iyamu also stands a good chance depending on the strategies applied by his platform and how Edo people may have perceived him since he defected to APC.
