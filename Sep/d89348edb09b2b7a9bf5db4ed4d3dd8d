Awaits NCAA’s approval 
The Accident Investigation Bureau (AIB) Nigeria has intensified surveillance capacity with the acquisition of drone technology for use in accident probes.
 
The Chief Executive Officer of AIB, Akin Olateru, told journalists recently in Lagos that investigators had already been trained as part of the approval processes for the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV).
 
Olateru noted that the drone technology was not deployed during the recent helicopter crash in Lagos because its operation was yet to be approved by the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA).
 
He said they were putting papers together towards the submission of application at NCAA.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
