 Kaduna Marathon Flag Off with El-rufai. Photo: KASTLEA1  Former national marathon champion, Abbas Mohammed, says the Kaduna marathon, slated for November 21 is timely.  The governor, who filled his registration form for the Kaduna marathon, also hinted that he would build stadiums in different parts of the state to discover more talents. He added: “I am a graduate of Coronavirus after surviving the virus. “I will participate in the race, but I will not run more than five kilometres. “The Kaduna marathon is not my initiative, but that of our team of technocrats. You need not to compliment the governor for it.” He disclosed that the marathon will cost between N250 million and N300 million, adding that the money is coming from private sponsorships and donations, with no recourse to public funds.  Meanwhile, the Chief Operating officer of Nilayo Sports, Seyi Johnson, has assured that the Kaduna marathon would be given the seriousness it deserves.
 
Speaking at the media briefing, a confident Johnson stated that Nilayo Sports would employ all logistics needed to make the maiden Kaduna marathon a huge success.
 
The winner of the elite race of 10 kilometres will take home a cash prize of $10,000, while the top 10 winners will all get cash prizes with the 10th placed taking $1,000. The local winners, from first to 10th, will get N3 million each to N250,000 respectively. A total of 20 elite athletes, both male and female will take part in the race.
