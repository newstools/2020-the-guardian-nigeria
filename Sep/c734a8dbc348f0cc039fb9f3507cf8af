Plateau’s Manjang wants Nigerians to embrace golf
Big fun awaits Nigeria’s best lady golfers in Jos next month as the organisers of the Lamingo Ladies Open have concluded plans, including installing the best of facilities at the breezy club, for this year’s event, which is expected to feature players from across the country.       
   
According to the club’s Lady Captain, Maryam Julde–Adura, the competition will hold from October 22 to 24. Speaking during a courtesy visit to Plateau State Commissioner for Information and Communication, Dan Manjang, in his office at the J.D. Gomwalk Secretariat in Jos, Julde– Adura said, “it is in preparation for the three–day event that lady golfers on the Plateau led by the Lady Captain of the Lamingo Golf Club, Maryam Julde – Adura, pay this visit.”  The Lady Captain promised that being golfers themselves and knowing the importance of the game of golf, they would ensure the success of the tournament, which is expected to draw people from far and near to the state. The team added that the event would empower the rural communities, as they would provide foodstuffs for sale and other side attractions for the visitors to buy. Responding, Plateau State Commissioner for Information and Communication, Dan Manjang, encouraged Nigerians to develop interest in golf, saying his association with the sport has dispelled his erroneous belief that golfers were just wasting their time
  
The commissioner revealed that since his appointment as information commissioner by Governor Simon Bako Lalong, who is also a seasoned golfer, his association with the game in company of the governor has made him realise that golf is actually not for lazy people.
