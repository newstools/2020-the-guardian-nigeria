Receiving President Roch Marc Christian Kabore of Burkina Faso, who was on a one-day official visit yesterday to the State House, Abuja, the Nigerian leader noted: “We are keeping tabs on situations in countries that have elections ahead. We know the nations that are calm and the ones where there have been unfortunate casualties. We will always support those who have elections ahead so that things can go smoothly.” The landlocked country holds legislative elections this November. Kabore, who chairs the Economic, Trade and Liberalisation Scheme of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), said he was in Nigeria to discuss crucial sub-regional issues with Buhari. Chief among them was the convening of a joint commission meeting by the two nations.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
