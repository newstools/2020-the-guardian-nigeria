Special Adviser on Sports to President Muhammadu Buhari, Daniel Amokachi, has described the performance of Nigerian players in European football as the best advertisement for the Nigerian Professional Football League (NPFL).  He said translating such good outings to the Super Eagles’ matches would draw attention to the players, prompting more clubs to scout for stars in the NPFL. Speaking on a radio programme monitored by The Guardian, Amokachi said Super Eagles’ players have so far proved that they are worthy to be in the national team, adding that the competition in the team has brought the best from the players.He believes the trend would entice foreign scouts into looking for players from the NPFL. “Nigeria’s foreign-based players have been performing well in their various clubs, which has forced agents to turn their attention to the country. “Look at Senegalese players… most of them play for top clubs abroad and that brings respect to their players anywhere they go. It also entices more people to go for their players. “Our players need to keep giving their best abroad to attract respect for every Nigerian player,” he said.
