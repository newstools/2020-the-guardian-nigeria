The Secretary-General of Pentecostal Bishops Association (PBAAS), Anambra State, Bishop Charles Uchenna, has sought support for a President of Igbo extraction in 2023. Uchenna, who spoke to The Guardian in Awka yesterday ahead of tomorrow’s opening of PBAAS Annual Conference in Enugu, also called for the restructuring of the country, insisting that it would help in addressing cries of marginalisation and oppression. The cleric said power shift would give every zone a sense of belonging as well as helping to address some of the country’s problems. According to him, the South East deserves the presidency to assure them that people in the region are not being discriminated against by other zones who have occupied the number one seat since Nigeria returned to civil rule in 1999. The Presiding Bishop of Lovebreeds’ Christian Ministries lamented the security challenges facing Nigeria, saying government must take decisive action to stop banditry, kidnapping, insurgency and other criminal activities in parts of the country. He criticised the Federal Government for retaining the services of the service chiefs despite calls for their removal. Uchenna lamented youth unemployment, urging all levels of government to create opportunities for youths to contribute to the development of the country. He said: ‘The problem we have in this country is that of insincerity, insensitivity and tribalism. We have not made up our mind to be one, especially those who have been privileged to be in power. The common man is ready and sincere about restructure, but cannot do it except the privileged ones in power. “The moment those in power show seriousness, Nigeria will work for the better.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
