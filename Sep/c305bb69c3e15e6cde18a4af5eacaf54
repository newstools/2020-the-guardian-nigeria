 Imo State University (IMSU). PHOTO: NAIJADAZZZ  According to the Public Relations Officer (PRO) of the institution, Nze Ralph Njoku-Obi, who confirmed this to The Guardian in a telephone interview, he said the identities of the lecturers and the panel will not be made known, adding that they can only be disclosed to the press after their investigation. The Guardian learned that the video of the professor and a Ph.D. holder (Head of a Department), both lecturing in the institution, went viral last weekend and early this week on social media, showing where the Head of Department raped a female student, while the professor was seen masturbating after raping a female student as well. The Guardian gathered from an unconfirmed source that one of the lecturers demanded to have sex with a final year student who is about getting married, adding that he also demanded N150, 000 from the student before she could graduate. Confirming the decision of the institutionâ€™s management, Njoku-Obi, said the authorities of IMSU have seen the video and suspecting their lecturers were involved, prompting them to raise a committee to investigate. A recent legislation passed by the National Assembly stipulates that the offender risks 14 years, while any member of the institution who fails to report such an act would face a two-year jail term.
