The Nigeria LP Gas Association (NLPGA), has asked its members and operators to ignore the directive of the Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency (PPPRA), on the levy and administrative fee imposed on Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) or cooking gas despite the product being deregulated.
 
The Association had argued that imposing administrative charges would be counter-productive, especially now that the government has taken deliberate steps to boost gas development, including LPG in Nigeria.  We will continue to explore all avenues to seek redress, promote ease of doing business and advocate for the better mutually beneficial business, public health safety and environment for all,” the Executive Secretary, Olakunle Oyebanjo said.
