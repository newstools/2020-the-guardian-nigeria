Former Acting Registrar of the National Examinations Council (NECO), Abubakar Gana, has denied diverting N368, 875 million of the June/July 2018 Senior Secondary Certification Examinations (SSCE) registration fees. He said the news making the rounds occurred on December 18, 2017, five months to his assumption of office on May 10, 2018. His words: “It must, however, be put on record that the infractions were uncovered by the council in 2017 under the watchful eyes of former registrar, Prof. Charles Uwakwe, but nothing was done to bring the perpetrators to book. “When I took over the affairs of the council in 2018, the misappropriation was officially reported to me, a development that led to the setting up of both management and board committees for investigation.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
