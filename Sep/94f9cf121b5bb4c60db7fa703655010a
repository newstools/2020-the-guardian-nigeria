Lagos State Police Command has declined further comments on the alleged illegal detention of late Moshood Kashimawo Olawale Abiola’s two sons, Kassim and Aliyu, arrested and detained over the September 2 robbery incident at the residence of the late politician in Ikeja.
 
They were detained after a detailed investigation by the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) and a complaint by their stepmother, Adebisi Abiola after the robbery incident.
 
But, reacting to the suit instituted by Abiola’s sons, Public Relations Officer of Lagos State Police Command, SP Muyiwa Adejobi, said: “On MKO Abiola’s sons’ arrest, we will be silent for now because the matter is subject of litigation. We will react as at when due.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
