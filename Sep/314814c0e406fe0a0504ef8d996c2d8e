 Ifeanyi Udeze  Speaking in the wake of the demise of ex Eagles star, Ajibade Babalade last week, Udeze said it is imperative for Nigerian footballers to be honoured and remembered after contributing their quota to national football development, adding that building a hall of fame museum would spur the current players to be more committed to national team duties. Udeze noted that Babalade’s death presented stakeholders the opportunity to reflect and plan how to honour Nigeria’s retired internationals. The ex Paok of Greece defender wondered how past heroes in Nigerian football could be remembered if a notable trade mark like the hall of fame museum does not exist. “Nigerian footballers, dead or living, who sacrificed for the country when they played for the Super Eagles, need to be remembered in a memorable manner. “Though they are neglected when they retire from football, they can be made proud of their contributions to the country through a hall of fame museum. “As an ex footballer, I will be delighted if a hall of fame museum is constructed for people of all generations to see the footballers and their roles in nation building. It will also motivate present Super Eagles players to give their best in the national team,” he said. On the Super Eagles team managed by Gernot Rohr, Udeze said the team have enough quality materials to succeed, adding, however, that the team would be a great side if the coaches choose only the best players.
