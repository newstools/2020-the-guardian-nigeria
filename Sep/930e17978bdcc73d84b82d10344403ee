Committed to serving the community especially the Physically-Challenged Persons, Lady Chioma Oti, a native of Oboro Ikwuano in Abia State has established a non-governmental organisation PLEO Reachout, to empower and give voice to people living with disabilities. According to Oti, people living with disabilities are deprived of the normal livelihood as they are treated in isolation and segregation. She said: “The physically challenged are deprived of education, employment and other basics of life which is why a huge number of the disabled in Nigeria live in abject poverty, hence the need for PLEO Reachout.  The idea is to liberate people living with disabilities from the long night of captivity in making sure that they have the same rights, opportunities, and respect as other citizens.” Oti further said: “During this pandemic, the organisation gave relief items to some families of people living with disabilities across Nigeria. Before the pandemic livelihood was hard for the physical challenge, now it is even harder. This is why we distributed COVID-19 palliatives in terms of food items, others, to people living with disability across the country.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
