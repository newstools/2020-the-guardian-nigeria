The Unity Forum of the APC in Oyo State has denounced media reports that the party has selected Otunba Adebayo Alao-Akala as its leader in the state. In a statement jointly signed by four of its leaders, Senators Soji Akanbi, Olufemi Lanlehin, Ayoade Adeseun and Alhaji Adebayo Shittu, the Forum said the report did not correctly capture what happened at the meeting held at the residence of Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State in Ibadan on September 20, 2020. It said that the nature of the meeting as agreed at the peace meeting earlier held in Abuja was subverted when members of the SENACO/ADP/PDP axis of the APC flooded the meeting with about 60 members, contrary to the 15 representatives that convener claimed had been invited to the meeting. It, therefore, condemned the claim that Alao-Akala was appointed the leader of the party at the meeting. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
