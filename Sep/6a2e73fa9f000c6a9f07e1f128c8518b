The Lagos State Government has opted for a low key celebration of the 60th Independence Anniversary due to the ravaging effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Lagos State information commissioner Gbenga Omotosho disclosed that Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has directed that the planned parade and other activities that involve the gathering of more than 50 people should be cancelled. “He congratulates Lagosians on this auspicious occasion and strongly advises that they should celebrate quietly at home and pray for the country,” Omotosho said. “They should also observe the COVID-19 protocols, including wearing of face masks to protect themselves and their loved ones.” The governor urges Lagosians not to relax their vigilance against COVID-19 to avoid reversing the gains that the state has made in fighting the disease. “They are to keep embracing physical distancing and washing of hands with soap and water. Anybody who feels unwell should stay indoors and contact health authorities,” Omotosho said. “The police and other security agencies have been directed to ensure that nobody flouts these directives in the interest of all of us, especially now that the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) is warning that a second wave of the deadly disease could occur.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
