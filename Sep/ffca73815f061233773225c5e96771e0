The Federal Government has approved additional N8.9 billion as COVID-19 hazard allowance for health workers in the country. Besides, procurement of personal protective equipment (PPE) for hospitals and isolation centres is to get more attention. Chairman of the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19 and Secretary to Government of the Federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha, who made the disclosure at the panel’s briefing yesterday in Abuja, observed that the industrial action by resident doctors had elicited discourses across the federation in the last one week. He said while appreciable progress had been made in resolving the impasse, the SGF underscored the “fact that we are in a global public health emergency situation that has impacted negatively on all aspects of our lives, including the economy and finances of government.” Mustapha continued: “This has made it imperative for all citizens irrespective of their professions and particularly health workers to re-awaken their sense of humanity and patriotism. The health and survival of our dear nation is important, and we should eschew any action that will diminish the gains made in the containment of the pandemic so far. Over the past one week, a lot of discussions in the public space have happened around the strike action by doctors and other unions in the health sector.” He added that the PTF was working with partners to speedily resolve the teething challenges faced by intending travellers in accessing the travel portal, costs of test on arrival, as well as the inability to complete payment online and board.
