Erica Nlewedim Disqualified From BBNaija For Multiple House Rules Violation Erica Nlwedim on Sunday evening was disqualified from Big Brother Naija House for flouting multiple house rules, including defacing Big Brother property and making the same unavailable for the use of another housemate. The budding actress was involved in a one-sided altercation with fellow housemate and former friend Laycon. Big Brother also accused her of trying to engage the production crew. She got her first and second strikes by Big Brother for breaking house rules in the house. Erica was found guilty for Whispering into Kiddwaya’s ear and Spending Nights with Kiddwaya in the Head of House Lounge. Her actions on Saturday got her the third strike. After the DJ Kaywise hosted the usual night party which saw Erica throw tantrums over Kiddwaya dancing with Nengi, the head of house confronted Laycon, over claims she tried to kiss him. The confrontation led to her making several violent statements, she also denied the Deputy head of house, Prince, access to the room. These among many others led to her disqualification. While some are happy about the disqualification, some are sad she had to leave that way. Below are some of the reactions: I’m actually sad about what is happening with Erica. #BigBrotherNaija #BBErica — Bambam (@bammybestowed) September 6, 2020  Dear @EricaNlewedim, whatever happens today, I will always love you.
