CSO holds voter education rally, seeks support for gov Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, has charged engineers to be professional in the discharge of their duties and deploy their expertise in ensuring the development of enduring infrastructure in the state. Obaseki, who gave the charge at an interactive session with the state chapter of Nigeria Society of Engineers (NSE) in Benin City, advocated increased partnership with the indigenous engineers to achieve his administration’s vision of making the state the industrial hub of the nation. “There is so much work for you people to do as we are redesigning Edo. We don’t have any master plan for anything; hence, anybody can build anywhere. The plan we had has expired and our population has outgrown what we designed as our physical space. “Whether it is in housing, road construction or electricity, we need help. That is why we must not allow those who do not have any idea about development to govern us again,” he said. On his part, Jonathan Ekhodiaehi, who spoke on behalf of the engineers, commended Obaseki for his developmental strides in the state.He said, “The developmental projects that have been going on in the state are all visible for all to see. People wake up in the morning and see that their environment has been developed.” MEANWHILE, a civil society group, No Sidon Look, at the weekend, held a voter education rally to sensitise the electorate on the need to vote for a credible candidate. The group admonished the people to vote for a candidate with pedigree and experience to sustain and improve on the present level of development in Edo. The CSO with interest in good governance, also reaffirmed its support for the reelection of Obaseki, who is candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), urging eligible voters to vote for the PDP to enable the governor continue with his achievements in the last four years. Director General of the group, Portrait Peterson, who commended Obaseki for his performance in all sectors, charged the electorate to turn out en masse with their Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) to ensure Obaseki’s reelection.
