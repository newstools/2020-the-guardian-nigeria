Wife Puts Up Poster After Discovering Husband Has Been Cheating A woman put up flyers warning her husband’s new neighbours that he had ‘abandoned’ her and her two children to live with another woman while they are still married. The posters were spotted in the US, showing a family photo with a red circle around the husband, alongside his wife and two children according to The Mirror. Underneath it reads: ABANDONED his wife and kids in NY to come to RTC and screw MILFs! (and for a cr***y gov’t job!) Some neighbour you have! He’s still married and living with another woman. POLICE: Please cite him for adultery, class 4 misdemeanour according to Virginia code. It was shared on Reddit, with the user saying the posters had been torn down by the following day. But some questioned the wife’s actions, writing: “Why would she put the kids’ pictures on the flyers?! Do that to this scumbag if you wish. “Considering the children’s pics are on there, I’m sure they have already been put through hell by their parents. I get it, a lover scorned, but the kids? Really?” Another wrote: “I would never do this either way, but I can’t understand why she didn’t just do a giant headshot of him. I understand she wants to emphasize the abandonment of his family component, but I feel like the words would have been enough. Well, it’s been said that “hell hath no fury like a woman scorned”.
