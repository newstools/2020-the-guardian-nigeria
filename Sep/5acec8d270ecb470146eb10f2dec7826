Denouncing “bad decisions on endless wars,” Trump stated that he was “Never a fan of John.” “Cindy can have Sleepy Joe!” concluded the president. Cindy McCain’s support for Biden, announced Tuesday, is a setback for Trump, who faces an uphill challenge in the election and boasts of having the entire Republican party behind him. The widow of the former senator tweeted “we are Republicans, yes, but Americans foremost. There’s only one candidate in this race who stands up for our values as a nation, and that is @JoeBiden.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
