The Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC) has said discussions are already in the offing towards carrying out dawn raids.
 
Dawn raid is an unannounced inspection by an investigatory authority, which causes major disruption to businesses.  Emphasising the responsibilities of targeting a dawn raid, Irukera said: “Be transparent. Ask questions where need be but do not resist. Have a team that provides sufficient support to make the work of the regulator smoother and the target of the investigation.”
 
At the panel session, Partner, Bowmans, Xolani Nyali, said employees must be informed about the raid, rather than them getting information from social media, adding that there should be internal publicity to keep them informed with controlled communication.
 
When being investigated, Senior Consultant, Evidence, CMS, Chris Baldwin, advised that it is very important to have a senior IT person outside, and stressed the need to keep accurate records of action that took place. The need to check who is authorised to be in the raid and the IT person is expected to be on the authorised list.
 
Partner, Udo Udoma and Belo-Osagie, Christine Sijuade, said: “When investigated and you don’t understand the question, ensure you (employee), get clarity rather than speculating or guessing around what you don’t understand in order not to further implicate yourself or rather call the right office to provide answers or wait for your lawyers to get clarity.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
