Kano Integrity and Justice Forum (KIJF), an independent organisation of elder statesmen, has thrown its weight behind the state government’s light rail transit project in Kano.
 
KIJF’s position, which comes after the Bashir Tofa-led group kicked against the project, was contained in a communique issued at the end of a one-day seminar, which held at Bristol Palace Hotel, Kano, with a view to obtaining private and public responses on the project.
 
The communique, which was jointly signed by the chairman and secretary, Prof Abdu Salihi and Dr Garba Shehu respectively, indicated that Kano is a major commercial and industrial centre in Nigeria and hence, the need for the development of its transportation infrastructure to cope with increasing demand.
