On April 10, 1985 during the miltary regime of Gen. Muhammadu Buhari (rtd), three drug pushers: Bartholomew Owoh (26), Bernard Ogedegbe (29), and Alhaji Akani Lawal (29) were tried, found guilty for drug-related offences under Decree Number 20 of l984, convicted and eventually put to death by firing squad. The execution of the ‘three youth’ rankled many at home and the international community, who described the punishment as too severe for the offences for which they were punished.
  
But Gen. Buhari’s government, however, stood its ground, arguing that drug trafficking and abuse must be deterred with stringent measures and punishments. Perhaps, Gen. Buhari and his second-in-command, late Gen. Tunde Idiagbon, might have seen far into the future the danger that drug trafficking and abuse would pose to the country, especially if it became what Nigeria’s future youth would take as a lifestyle and faster route to making easy wealth.  AT another plenary, the Assembly also read the riot act to the executive arm on the whereabouts of the three helicopters belonging to the state government. The Assembly therefore summoned the Chief of Staff to the Governor, Mr. Tayo Ayinde, and the Commissioner for Economic Planning and Budget, Commissioner For Special Duties and the management of Lagos State Security Trust Fund (LSSTF) to appear before it to explain the whereabouts of the state’s helicopters. The Chief Whip of the Assembly, Hon. Mojisola Miranda, who raised the issue, said the officers and MDAs in-charge of the helicopters should furnish the Assembly with details of the agreement between the government and managers of the helicopters, Caverton Helicopters and how the equipment were deployed to serve the state.
