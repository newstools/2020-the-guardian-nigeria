All is set for the inaugural virtual Annual Business Luncheon (ABL) of the Capital Market Solicitors’ Association (CMSA). Scheduled for September 15, 2020, the theme of the virtual ABL is “Financial Opportunities in the Capital Markets – An Aid to Improving the Nigerian Healthcare Sector.” Speaking on the theme of the conference, Efeomo Olotu, chair of the ABL Planning Committee said: “The Nigerian healthcare sector has faced numerous challenges ranging from poor funding and inadequate health infrastructure to a great loss in revenue of over $1billion annually from medical tourism. Similar to any other form of organized economic activity, easy access to capital is important for the efficient delivery of high-quality medical services in any healthcare sector worldwide.” “At the 2020 virtual ABL, we intend that discussions focus on the current climate in the Nigerian healthcare sector following the COVID-19 pandemic, governmental response and the role of the capital market in creating pathways in strengthening a stunted healthcare sector through easy access to capital in resolving the prevalent challenges against affordability, accessibility, liquidity and funding.” This luncheon promises to be engaging and a conversation opener with the opening address and keynote speech delivered by Lamido Yuguda, director–general of the Securities & Exchange Commission, and Olabode Agusto, founding managing director of Agusto & Co., and chairman of the advisory board of First Cardiology Consultant, respectively.
