Former President Goodluck Jonathan, Oyo State Governor Seyi Makinde, his Enugu and Ebonyi counterparts, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi and Dave Umahi, have been named peace ambassadors to celebrate the International Day of Peace holding today. Others on the list are ex-Governors Peter Obi and Sullivan Chime, as well as Senators Enyinnaya Abaribe and Chimaroke Nnamani. The beneficiaries also included Chief Executive Officer of Atlas Oriento Petroleum, Chief Arthur Eze, Archbishop of Enugu Province (Anglican Communion), Most Rev. Emmanuel Chukwuma, and founder, Al-Mustapha Peace, Unity Initiative, and Dr. Hamza Al-Mustapha. A statement in Enugu by the country’s Programmes Director, Global Society for Anti-Corruption (GSAC), Mrs. Amaka Nweke, stated that the recognition followed their contributions to promotion and sustenance of peace in diverse ways. She said the global event was to recognise those who “have worked hard to promote and sustain peace in various ways in the society.” On this year’s theme, “Shaping Peace Together”, Nweke said what the world needed this period were activities that could promote understanding, tolerance, and togetherness. “There are so many conflicts, disagreements, and crises in the land. More than 90 per cent of what we see and hear every day is conflict, which often results in death and deprivation. “The International Day of Peace, is, therefore, instituted to remind mankind of the need to promote and sustain peace. So with peace, we can build a society that endures. With peace, we can develop and achieve whatever we want to achieve. Peace is needed in the political, economic, and social spheres. It is easy to talk about peace, but a difficult thing to practise. That is why, each time we see anybody that has done something to promote peace, we try as much as possible to encourage the person to do more by way of recognition,” she added.
