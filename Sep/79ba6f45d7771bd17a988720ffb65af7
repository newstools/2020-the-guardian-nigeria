Experts in the construction industry have highlighted the critical roles engineers could play in the management of the novel coronavirus pandemic. They spoke during the engineering week organized by the Apapa Branch of the  Nigerian Society of Engineers (NSE). Setting the tone of discussion on ‘Management of Pandemic –  Engineering perspective’, at a virtual lecture, retired Deputy Director, Highway, Federal Ministry of works and Housing, Mr. Chukwuemeka Ogwara, said the coronavirus outbreak has clearly confirmed the necessity for governments at different levels to seek and utilize scientific advice in the discharge of matters relating to pandemic. According to him, the pandemic has demonstrated the globalized nature of the new and evolving challenges that mankind is facing and the crucial role that engineers have to play as they are needed now more than ever. He stressed that the rise in Covid-19 cases has continued unabated regardless of the huge resources expended, while updates and responses on Covid-19 outbreak by different countries, are often based on scientific and medical researches. “The Engineers have relegated only to the call to arms the 3-D printing components for ventilators.  The exclusion of engineering experts in SAGE/NCDC team is counterproductive and hence hindering the contribution of engineers to the pandemic”, he said. On her own part,  a national executive member of  NSE, Mrs. Halimat Adediran called for the inclusion of engineers in the management of the coronavirus pandemic, stressing the need for a mix between pharmaceutical intervention and professionals. According to her,   there is a need  to include the partial control mechanism in any state and federal plan.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
