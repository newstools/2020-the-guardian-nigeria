Julija Adlesic, 22, plotted with her boyfriend to have her left hand severed above the wrist at their home in the capital Ljubljana early last year. She had claimed it happened as she cut branches, the Sun UK reported. A court in the capital found that Adlesic had taken out five insurance policies in the year before her injury. Her boyfriend, Sebastien Abramov was sentenced to three years in prison while his father received a one-year suspended sentence. Days before the incident, Abramov had searched the internet for information about how artificial hands work, prosecutors said, calling it further proof that it was done deliberately.

However, authorities recovered it in time to sew it back on. During the trial, Adlesic claimed innocence. “No one wants to be crippled,” she told the court. “My youth has been destroyed. Only I know how it happened.” The trial has attracted lots of public and media attention in the country. Judge Marjeta Dvornik, who handed the sentence said: “We believe the sentences are fair and appropriate and will serve their purpose.”
