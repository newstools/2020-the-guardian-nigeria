Negative macroeconomic indices and unstable economic outlook depressed transactions on the equities sector of the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), as the All-Share Index depreciated by 0.08 per cent to close the week at 25,572.57. All other indices finished lower with the exception of NSE Main Board, NSE Pension, NSE Insurance, NSE Meri Growth, NSE Consumer Goods, NSE Lotus II and NSE Industrial Goods Index, which appreciated by 0.13 per cent, 0.06 per cent, 0.01 per cent, 0.17 per cent, 0.13 per cent, 0.19 per cent, and 0.50 per cent, respectively, while NSE ASeM Index closed flat. At the end of trading last week, the market sustained a sliding profile for three consecutive trading days. Analysts predicted that the mixed performance is likely to persist, as September progresses in the midst of profit-booking, mismatch of economic policies, and negative macroeconomic indices. The Chief Research Officer, Investdata Consulting, Ambrose Omordion, said: “Capital waves in the financial market may persist in the midst of relatively low-interest rates in the money market, high inflation, negative Q2 GDP of 6.1 per cent, and unstable economic outlook for the rest of 2020. “This is just as the government and its economic managers are going back and forth with mismatched policies and implementation. Since rising hyperinflation in the country would remain unchanged in the near future due to the economic reform policies emanating from the government and its policy makers, investors should be mindful of the on-going correction.” He continued: “August consumer price index released Tuesday, by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), revealed a strong spike in inflation at 13.22 per cent from the previous month 12.82 per cent, reflecting the glaring impacts of the mismatch policies, high cost transportation, and the heightened insecurity that has affected farmers. “This is besides the low produce resulting from climate change, and the incessant increase in fuel prices before the recent hike in the name of full deregulation and removal of subsidy on petrol. “Focus should therefore be on companies likely to benefit from the on-going pandemic. When interest rates are low, stocks are typically seen as more attractive despite the high inflation that is threatening returns and yields,” he said. Analysts at Codros Capital said: “In the absence of a positive catalyst, and given the still uninspiring macro story, we guide investors to trade cautiously in the short term. “However, we expect the market might benefit over the longer term on compelling valuations, and as investors seek alpha-yielding opportunities in the face of negative real returns in the fixed income market.” A breakdown of market performance during the week showed sustained bargain-hunting in most blue-chip stocks, as trading on the NSE reopened upbeat on Monday, causing the All-Share Index (ASI), to rise by 0.05 per cent.
