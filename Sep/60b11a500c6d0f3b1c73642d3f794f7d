Super Eagles’ goalkeeper Daniel Akpeyi says he is recovering fast from the injury he suffered while on duty for his club, Kaizer Chiefs, against Bidvest Wits in a South African Premier League encounter at the weekend. The former Warri Wolves goaltender and his teammates at Kaizer Chiefs suffered a 1-0 defeat against Bidvest Wits, a defeat, which has put their league title aspirations in danger. Akpeyi did not finish the match with Kaizer Chiefs after suffering an injury in the 43rd minute following a collision with Mxolisi Macuphu. He spent up to 10 minutes on the pitch while being treated by the medical team before being taken out to the hospital. While responding to a message from The Guardian yesterday, Akpeyi said: “Thanks so much for checking on me. I am really grateful. I am recovering faster.” Though Akpeyi did not state how soon he would return to action, it is feared the Nigerian goalkeeper may be out of action till next season. Akpeyi, who was part of the Super Eagles’ squad that grabbed bronze at Egypt 2019 AFCON, was replaced with Bruce Bvuma, who went on to concede the goal that condemned Kaizer Chiefs to a defeat in the tough League encounter. It was the first time in 12 matches that Chiefs failed to score in a League game. Akpeyi has been an important member of the Kaizer Chiefs this season and has manned the post in 25 games. He is expected to be in shape for Super Eagles’ match against Sierra Leone in November.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
