Ekeh had based his recommendation on the giant strides recorded by the country in the area of Information and Communication Technology (ICT).

Considering the massive strides recorded so far in our journey to technological emancipation, the Federal Government should strongly consider declaring October 1st Nigeria’s technology independence day,’’ Ekeh had suggested.
