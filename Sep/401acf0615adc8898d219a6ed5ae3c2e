3 Reasons To Consider Kiwi For Your Skin Everybody knows the advantages of eating well and getting all the necessary vitamins, preferably from natural products and not as supplements. Luckily, we can get almost everything through the food we eat. However, one important fruit that is important for the skin is the Kiwi fruit. The fruit is a rich source of Vitamin C, E, and antioxidants, all of which are very beneficial for our bodies according to Reward me. Below are some importance of Kiwi fruit for the skin: For Acne
You can use kiwi for skin affected by acne. Its anti-inflammatory properties fight and clear acne. You can apply mashed kiwi to boils and skin inflammations to clear them faster. Kiwi is also useful in controlling sebum (oil) production. A greasy, sticky face isnâ€™t just unpleasant to look at but also a major contributor to skin problems. To do this:
Apply a paste of one mashed kiwi and a teaspoon of lemon juice to your face. Leave it on for 15-20 minutes before washing it off. The combined power of the two ingredients will control sebum production, leaving your face fresh and clean. Reduces Ageing
The antioxidants in the fruit help delay signs of ageing like wrinkles, fine lines, and age spots. You can use an almond-kiwi face pack to get rid of and prevent signs of ageing. For this:
Soak 7-8 almonds overnight and grind them to a fine paste the next morning. Add a whole mashed kiwi to this along with half a teaspoon of gram flour (besan). Apply this pack to your freshly washed and dried face. Let it sit for 20 minutes before washing it off with cold water. For Dark Circles
If you are prone to dark under-eye circles, using a kiwi is a much better option than any cosmetic product. For this to work:
Simply place kiwi slices over your eyes and relax for 10-15 minutes. Remove the slices and wash your face. Do this regularly and over time you will see the dark circles reduce.
