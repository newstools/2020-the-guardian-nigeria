 train accident  According to the Lagos State Traffic Management Authority (LASTMA) and the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), the train rammed into the Volkswagen T4 bus at the Arena crossing, pushing it to Oshodi under-bridge.
 
The Guardian gathered that Ugobidi and his son, Arinze, were in a grey-coloured Toyota Highlander SUV with registration number, FST 723 FL, when the train dragged the Volkswagen T4 bus towards their direction.
 
Medical personnel at the One Life Hospital, where the victims were rushed to, confirmed that the trader was brought in dead while his son was transferred to Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH), Ikeja, for treatment.  The Nigeria Railway Corporation (NRC) said the train had since arrived at its destination at Iddo. The Lagos District Manager of NRC, Jerry Oche, in a chat with The Guardian confirmed that a team of railway engineers was on its way to the site to assess the impact of the accident and the level of damage done to the tracks. The Guardian reports that the accident happened on the day the corporation resumed the Lagos-Ogun Mass Transit Train (MTT) after over five-month shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Oche said: “We resumed this morning and at Arena level crossing, there was an accident because a vehicle was abandoned at the track. So the train hit the vehicle. LASEMA was helpful because they were the ones that came to remove the vehicles off the track. “The train has got to its destination which is Iddo. It was coming from Ijoko. We are going there now to assess the damage to the track before we know whether we can run the train again today or not. Of course, we also have to evacuate whatever that is left there on the tracks.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
