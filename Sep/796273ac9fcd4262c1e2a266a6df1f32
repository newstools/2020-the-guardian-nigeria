Former international, Waidi Akanni, believes Victor Moses, who retired from the Super Eagles immediately after the Russia 2018 World Cup, still has the ability to play for the senior national team if he changes his mind. Moses, who spent last season on loan from Chelsea at Serie A giants, Inter Milan, was impressive in a friendly match against Cobham on Tuesday, where he scored the equaliser. Reported not to be in Frank Lampard’s plan for the new season, Moses is expected to go on loan again till the end of his contract. Akanni said, “Moses is still a very good player and I think it is just a matter of who is the coach at Chelsea. He is still capable of playing for the country, unless he doesn’t want to play for us again. “For whatever he is going through right now, it’s just a matter of time because some clubs will eventually come for his service. Whatever reason a player has not to represent his country should be respected. And if he decides to play for the country again, then he can be invited. “But for now, the coach should just do with those that he has on his list of invitation for any game. I know the coach has a lot of players who will fit into his plans. For every game, all coaches have their crop of players whether they play for first team or not in their various clubs,” he said. Akanni added: “I believe the current Eagles’ coach has his own core players who he will like to stick with because they fit into his plan. But technically, if there are players, who are not playing regularly for their teams, I am not sure he will invite them because that won’t be proper.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
