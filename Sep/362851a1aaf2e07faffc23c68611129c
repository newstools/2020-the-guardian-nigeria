The Nigerian government has adjusted the curfew from 12 midnight to 4am, as it continues the gradual easing of lockdown measures imposed to curb the spread of COVID-19 in the country. National coordinator of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19, Dr Sani Aliyu, announced the review on Thursday during a briefing in Abuja. Aliyu explained that people on essential service and travellers returning from overseas travels are exempted from the curfew. “We are modifying the curfew to commence from 12 midnight to 4am nationwide, effective from 12:00 tonight,” Aliyu said. “This does not apply to people on essential services and international travellers that might be returning from abroad.” He also stated that all limitations to land travels have been lifted and markets across the country can now open and operate all day. Similarly, the PTF national coordinated also stated that cinemas and amusement parks can also operate, with the exception of bars and night clubs, which he said, will remain closed. Aliyu urged states considering reopening their schools to conduct risks assessment before doing so, to enable the safety of all vulnerable groups. In June, the PTF reduced the nationwide curfew from 10 pm to 4 am to limit social interactions and, reduce the risk of transmission of the virus.
