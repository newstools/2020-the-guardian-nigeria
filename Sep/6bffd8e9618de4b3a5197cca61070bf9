She also warned motorists not to give bribe to any officer, urging them to report anyone who demanded money from them to the office. Ibrahim urged drivers to obey traffic regulations to enhance safety on the roads, especially with the increased vehicular movement during the ’ember’ months as a result of end-of-year activities. According to her, the command is planning to have motor parks rallies after some modalities are put in place. She described road safety as everyone’s business, which must not be left in the hands of the commission alone. “Motorists and other road users are advised to take road traffic tips seriously as they travel,” Ibrahim said. The sector commander urged drivers to ensure that their vehicles were in good driving conditions before embarking on journeys.
