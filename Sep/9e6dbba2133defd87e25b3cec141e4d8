The Nigeria LP Gas Association (NLPGA), has asked its members and operators to ignore the directive of the Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency (PPPRA), on the levy and administrative fee imposed on Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) or cooking gas despite the product being deregulated.
 
The Association had argued that imposing administrative charges would be counter-productive, especially now that the government has taken deliberate steps to boost gas development, including LPG in Nigeria.
  
According to the group, barely a few months after the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) commenced levying Off-takers’ Permit, which to the group, led to loading disruptions at a number of depots, the PPPRA has now announced that it is levying almost N50,000 per 20MT truck as administrative fee.  “We have also escalated this and other challenges with government regulatory agencies to the Presidency with promises to intervene swiftly.
  
“You are, by this mail, urged to ignore and do not comply with the proposed directive. We will continue to explore all avenues to seek redress, promote ease of doing business and advocate for the better mutually beneficial business, public health safety and environment for all,” the Executive Secretary, Olakunle Oyebanjo said.
