• Nigerian children featured in new series to commemorate day In two days’ time, Nigerians, in the world over, will raise the national flag, sing the anthem and observe a key moment in the country’s history, as it observes 60 years of independence from Britain.

Tagged the Magic Makers Initiative, the programme is all about inspiring creativity to make those magical moments shine just a little brighter.  The series, which kicked off on Mother’s Day, followed by Father’s Day, allows little ones to show off their wildest, craziest, and imaginative ideas to the community. For this third edition, Nigerian children will join in the Independence Day celebrations – customarily observed by spending the day with family or visiting friends and having a traditional meal together – by sharing the fruits of their creative imaginations with their peers across Africa, showcasing their cultural diversity. Launched about two weeks ago, Boomerang’s Magic Makers website will give children 60 reasons to celebrate Nigeria’s Independence Day through a video series providing children with a voice, showcasing their stories, and giving them a platform to share cool, creative ideas to mark the day. From specially designed crafts to yummy recipes, DIY stop-motion tutorials, quizzes to interactive activities and games to encourage creative thinking, the website will keep kids entertained with refreshed, fun, new stuff to discover until the end of October.
