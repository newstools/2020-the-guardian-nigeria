It is gathered that she got her passion for construction from her father who is also a builder. She enrolled at the Umgungundlovu TVET College in her home city after she made the decision to become an engineer in 2014. Speaking about her flair for construction, Zama revealed that she has never worked in construction before but the practical exams she had passed during college gave her the confidence that she could build the extension to her house by herself. She said: “This is what I am good at. Renovating my home is very fun and exciting at the same time, practicals are more fun than theory.” Zama dreams of running her own construction company and plans to empower more women in the engineering industry. “Always put your best in everything that you do, never underestimate the power of pouring your heart in what you do. Always seek to improve and empower yourself,” Zungu advised other women. You can watch videos of Zama working HERE and HERE.
