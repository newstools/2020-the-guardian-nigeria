Vanesa Gesto and Ivan Rico We have read several bizarre stories of just how far people are willing to go when it comes to exerting their revenge on an ex but this one that happened in Spain has got to top it all. A woman identified as Vanesa Gesto has been sentenced to 10 years in prison after she glued up her own private parts in a bid to frame her ex-boyfriend Ivan Rico for the crime. Gesto accused Rico of kidnapping her outside her home and later abandoning her while semi-naked after squeezing the superglue into her private parts. Her lie began to fall apart when investigators uncovered CCTV footage from a Chinese-run supermarket showing Gesto buying the glue and a ‘kidnap kit’ including knives she used to harm herself. Not only that, but it was also discovered that no vehicles save for a council bin lorry passed the area she claimed to have been assaulted and tortured. Gesto in her claim had said that she was kidnapped in a black car. A court in the northern Spanish city of Leon convicted her of two counts of making up a crime and jailed her for 10 years. State prosecutors had demanded an 11 year, an eight-month prison sentence. Gesto who was dubbed the ‘Glue Liar’ was also ordered to pay her ex 25,000 Euros (about £22,250) in compensation.  Prior to her lies being discovered, 36-year-old Rico had spent days in prison. Rico’s brother Rafael, who said from day one his sibling was sleeping when the supposed glue attack and kidnap took place, said: “Our mum spent days crying after he was arrested. Gesto’s original lawyer Emilia Esteban cut ties with her former client after it emerged she had tried to frame Rico over the made-up October 2016 crime. Lawyer Mrs Esteban said: “I always believed Vanesa and that’s why I defended her. “I feel humiliated and deceived.”
