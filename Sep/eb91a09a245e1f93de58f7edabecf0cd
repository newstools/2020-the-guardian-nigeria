Deputy Senate President and Chairman of the Committee on Constitution Review, Ovie Omo-Agege, explained that the date extension was at the behest of interest groups. He called on those agitating for state creation to reach out to other geo-political zones and lawmakers. A source at the committee secretariat said: “We are supposed to stop the collection of memoranda yesterday (Tuesday) or even today (Wednesday) based on the earlier announcement made to Nigerians, but a counter directive has been given that such collection should continue till Friday next week (September 18, 2020) apparently due to pressure being mounted on the committee.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
