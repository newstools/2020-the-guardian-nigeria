• Says areas gradually overcoming power, water supply challenges The Nigeria Export Processing Zone Authority (NEPZA), has again reminded operators that all enterprises in the free trade zones (FTZ) should be allowed to enjoy a free tax regime, as espoused by drafters of the Authority’s concept.  Adesugba, who assumed office as Chief Executive Officer NEPZA three months ago, remarked that the private zones are gradually overcoming the challenges of power and water supply, adding that Mr President is committed to making the public zones enjoy similar infrastructural stability. He, however, said the public and private sectors must agree to work together to jointly solve some of the problems negating the smooth operations of free zones in Nigeria. He reiterated that the FTZ scheme is a presidential initiative, aimed at propelling economic growth through local production, adding that the government is aware of the challenges associated with zones’ operations, but considers the prospects and gains to far outweigh those challenges. According to him, the arrangement to upgrade electricity supply to the Calabar and Kano zones directly managed by the government has reached an advanced stage.
