• Ondo NUJ Task Force Clamps Down On Fake Journalists The National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Uche Secondus, has declared that the President Muhammadu Buhari-led Federal Government and ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has failed Nigerians in all ramifications. Secondus said this, yesterday, in Akure during the PDP governorship campaign flag-off, noting that the only thing Buhari owes Nigerians is to conduct credible polls before he leaves in 2023, especially in Edo and Ondo states. According to him, security, power, economy and other sectors have collapsed under the APC-led government. He expressed hope that PDP would defeat the ruling party in the forthcoming governorship elections in Edo and Ondo states. The PDP chieftain urged people of Ondo State to vote PDP governorship candidate, Eyitayo Jegede, as APC government under Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu has turned governance into family business. Oyo State governor and Chairman, National PDP Campaign Council for Ondo State election, Seyi Makinde, urged the people not to be scared of Federal might. Makinde also advised the people to ignore the sentiments being spread by APC that the governorship election would determine Yoruba Presidency, saying PDP’s preoccupation was restructuring. He said: “Last week, they came and told you to vote for them because of 2023. This election is not about presidency for Yoruba, it is all about delivery of good governance. Don’t be scared. In 2019 in Oyo State, we were not at the Federal Government level, not even at the local level, but we have God and human beings and we won. It can also happen here. “This election is special. Use it to deliver this state. This coming election is about choosing freedom against continued servitude…” The Governor of Sokoto State, Aminu Tambuwal, tasked the people to consolidate on their victory in the last general elections to defeat APC again. “APC is in disarray, not only in Ondo State, but also at the national level. They are in confusion; they are not able to settle their leadership crisis. Therefore, it is not a choice for Ondo State.” Jedege pledged to run an all-inclusive government, if elected, saying his government would transform infrastructure, health and education sectors, among others. He said he would also prioritise workers’ welfare and reduce tuition in all tertiary institutions. Other dignitaries present at the event were: former governors of Osun and Ekiti states, Olagunsoye Oyinlola and Segun Oni, former deputy governor of Sokoto State, Alhaji Muftau Shagari; Senator Nicholas Tofowomo and Senator Abiodun Olujimi, among others. Meanwhile, the state council of Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) chased away fake journalists, who were harassing unsuspecting citizens, from operating in the state. The task force swung into action at the Akure Airport, as dignitaries arrived for PDP campaign flag-off. The Adetona Aderoboye-led state executive had constituted the task force, led by Kayode Animasaun to check activities of miscreants, who disguise as journalists and extort money from unsuspecting personalities. NUJ, at its last monthly meeting, had inaugurated the task force that would go after the miscreants that have been masquerading as journalists, laying siege at entry points to fleece dignitaries. According to reports, a number of them were said to have been parading themselves as correspondents of some major media organisations, with cloned identification cards.
