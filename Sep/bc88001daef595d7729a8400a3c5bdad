Under the proposal for a transitional government, the president would be a “civil or military personality”. The talks mark the second round of discussions between the young officers who overthrew President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita on August 18 and civilian representatives, many of whom had campaigned for him to resign. The junta, just hours after the coup, pledged to restore civilian government and stage elections within a “reasonable time”. But many participants at the forum are divided over issues such as how long a transition government should last, and what role the army should play. The 15-nation Economic Community of West African States has insisted that the junta hand over power within 12 months. Mahmoud Dicko, an influential imam viewed as the figurehead of the June 5 Movement which waged a protest campaign against Keita, has also backed a swift return to civilian rule. The talks conclude on Saturday. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
