 Abdulrasheed Maina. Photo: PMNEWS  In the petition made available to newsmen on Wednesday, Maina sought a review of the criminal charges filed against him by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). Maina urged Malami to review all the cases involving him to ensure that his prosecution was not malicious. “Our client’s prosecution by the EFCC came to a head principally due to his demand that the EFCC should account for the sums and property recovered by the PRTT, and kept in the EFCC’s custody. “The petition became necessary as our client was consistently accused by the anti-graft agency of diversion of the funds recovered instead of accounting for the sums and property in its custody.” Maina alleged that a campaign of calumny was lunched against him to obfuscate the issues and divert attention from the inability to account for the property recovered by the task force. He appealed for a review of the cases on the grounds that he had at all times, performed his duties in the best interest of the nation and not his personal interest.
