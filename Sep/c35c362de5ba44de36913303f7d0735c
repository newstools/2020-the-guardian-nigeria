Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike has described the Justice Karibi-Whyte hospital project, which allegedly gulped $39.9 million under the immediate past administration in the state, as a scam. Wike said the multi-billion naira project merely existed on paper, as there was nothing to show at the proposed site that such a project ever existed. The governor in Port Harcourt, yesterday, alleged that his predecessor, now Minister of Transportation, Chibuike Amaechi, during his reign was more interested in awarding political projects to boost his personal ego than delivering services to Rivers people. Beside, he accused his predecessor of also spending N65 billion on the 1.2 kilometres abandoned monorail project, which was also conceived as a white elephant project. Wike, who spoke while reacting to Amaechi’s assertion during the funeral of Justice Karibi-Whyte at the weekend that he was one of the best governors the state has ever produced, alleged that Amaechi and his political allies after siphoning huge sums of money from the state, left behind uncompleted projects. “Amaechi does not have the moral ground to talk about development in the state when he wasted so many financial resources on non-existing projects. “Go round the state, you will never see anything that looks like Justice Karibi-Whyte Hospital. It is a scam that never existed. He stated that unlike Amaechi that kills dreams and projects of other people, he voted money to complete road projects his predecessor initiated. He also berated Amaechi for lamenting insecurity in Rivers State when he is the one who determines heads of security agencies that should be posted to the state.
