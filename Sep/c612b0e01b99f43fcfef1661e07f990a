The party observed that the people “are already in trepidation that the excruciating price increase is a sudden death sentence on many citizens, particularly those living below poverty line, as they cannot survive under a worsened economic situation.” It argued that with a “N30,000 federal monthly minimum wage, which represents a N1,000 ($2.1) daily wage, there is no way an average Nigerian can survive under the excessive fuel and electricity hike, with attendant increases in transportation and other operational costs, which will leave most citizens with nothing for food, medicines, house rents and other basic necessities of life.” The PDP reminded President Muhammadu Buhari that “this hike would worsen the scary situation in the last five years, where compatriots are resorting to suicide, slavery mission abroad as well as selling their children as options.” The party said it found it “extremely cruel and insensitive for any body, particularly an official of this administration, to attempt to antagonise Nigerians by comparing our nation to other countries where their Presidents are working hard in providing gainful employments, running productive economies and functional infrastructure, and where citizens boast of strong purchasing power.” It therefore rejected the argument by Mohammed that fuel price is lower in some West African countries, “without presenting the contradictory economic settings in those countries and ours.” PDP urged the Nigerian leader to know that the “duty of every responsible government is to solve problems and not to inflict pain and invent justification for its own failures.” “On this fuel and electricity price increase, the PDP, once again, charges President Buhari to end the grandstanding of his administration and listen to Nigerians before it is too late,” the party stated.
