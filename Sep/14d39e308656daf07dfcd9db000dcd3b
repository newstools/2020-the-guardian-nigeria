The Presidential Task Force (PTF), yesterday, admitted that the ongoing strike by the Joint Health Sector Unions (JOHESU) would endanger more lives, as measures are being intensified to contain the spread of the disease. The panel’s Chairman and Secretary to Government of the Federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha, who was speaking at its weekly briefing in Abuja, commended development partners for their support so far. Urging sustenance of the partnership, he pointed out that one critical element people must not lose sight of was that the PTF’s “cautious approach has tremendously helped the nation’s containment efforts.” Mustapha urged the people to guard against complacency, adding: “Our focus should go beyond flattening the curve and ridding our land of this virus, just as we did with the poliovirus.” He continued: “Similarly, the contribution of our health workers has no doubt contributed to our gains. In this regard, the PTF wishes to appreciate the National Association of Resident Doctors (NARD) for calling off their strike action.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
