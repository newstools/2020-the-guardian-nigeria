Apple Fans Get “Animated Like” Icon When They Like #AppleEvent Hashtag Tweets The moment that Apple fans have been waiting for is finally almost here, as Apple will host its annual event Tuesday afternoon. The event, called ‘Time Flies’, will begin at 18:00 BST today and could see Apple launch a range of exciting products, most notably the iPhone 12. In the build-up to the event, the #AppleEvent hashtag has been trending on Twitter. Eager Apple fans liking these tweets have been treated a special surprise, in the form of animation on the ‘like’ icon. While Twitter usually just shows you a dark pink heart when you like a tweet, if you like a tweet with the #AppleEvent hashtag included, you’ll find that the ‘like’ icon outlines in blue, then pink, before turning dark pink. This is a nod to Apple’s logo for the event, which also features a blue looping design. However, the special animation is only available on the iOS Twitter app, so desktop and Android users won’t be able to see it. Many Apple fans have discovered the surprise, and are absolutely loving it as reported by The Mirror. There have been reactions to this: If they actually do give us the iPhone 12 today, I’ll shave off my eyebrows. #AppleEvent — Jon Prosser (@jon_prosser) September 15, 2020  Omg Because of #AppleEvent the  its Crazy and the  Iven more Crazier Try it :3 pic.twitter.com/VzTYnznQYX — Monika⁷ (@Monika83830) September 15, 2020  Reminder of the things I said you can expect FOR SURE in today’s #AppleEvent iPad Air 4
