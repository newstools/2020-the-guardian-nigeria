Chelsea defender Davide Zappacosta joined Italian side Genoa on a season-long loan on Saturday. Italy international Zappacosta has moved back to Serie A after his loan to Roma last season was interrupted by a knee ligament injury. He recovered from surgery in time to make six appearances in the Italian top-flight before the end of the season. The 28-year-old right-back, who joined Chelsea in 2017, has been a fringe figure with the Premier League club, making 34 starts and a further 18 substitute appearances. Zappacosta, who has won 13 Italy caps, joins a Genoa side that finished 17th in Serie A last season.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
