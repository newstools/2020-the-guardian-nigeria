Megan Thee Stallion and Tory Lanez Tory Lanez texted Megan Thee Stallion an apology hours after he allegedly shot at her according to a message seen by the media outlet, TMZ. Last month, Megan Thee Stallion publicly accused the Canadian rapper and singer of shooting her in the feet after an argument. She was shot twice in both feet. According to a text seen by TMZ, Lanez blamed the incident on alcohol. On July 12, about 15 hours after the shooting, Lanez texted Stallion, who at that time was hospitalized, asking for forgiveness. “I know u prolly never gone talk to me again, but I genuinely want u to know I’m sorry from the bottom of my heart,” he wrote. He added: “I was just too drunk.” Lanez, Megan, and another friend had spent the day partying in the Hollywood Hills when police responding to reports of shots fired pulled them over. When they instructed them to exit, Megan Thee Stallion had injuries on her feet. He continued in the text: “None the less sh*t should have never happened and I can’t change what did. I just feel horrible. Cuz I genuinely just got too drunk.” Lanez was arrested and charged with carrying a concealed weapon in his vehicle. The police said they found under the front passenger seat where he’d been sitting, according to TMZ. Megan did not call out Lanez until August 19 during an Instagram Live “You shot me,” she said, addressing Lanez in her video. “And you got your publicist and your people going to these blogs lying and sh*t. Stop lying. Why lie? I don’t understand.” TMZ reports that Lanez has not been arrested or charged for the shooting, however, the L.A. County D.A. is considering charging him with felony assault with a firearm.
