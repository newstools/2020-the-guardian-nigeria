After a six-year absence, Ibadan Football Association (IFA) is set to revive the Olubadan Cup with improved cash prize of N350, 000. The next edition of the competition is the 46th since its inception. IFA, which is the second oldest football body in Nigeria, will also organise a Super Eight competition, which will be used to determine the winner of the 2020 League. The Super Eight will also determine four teams that will join the standing 16 for IFA League 2021. A statement from the Olubadan Stadium office of the Association, signed by Folorunsho Oyelakin, said: “Since the 2020 IFA League could not hold due to the COVID-19 pandemic, IFA decided to cap the year with the twin soccer events. “Just as the last edition, the 2020 Olubadan Cup will be on a knock-out basis from start to finish with the eventual first to third place winners getting N200, 000; N100, 000 and N50, 000 respectively. This is the second highest cash rewards at stake for winners of the championship. “The highest cash prize was N600, 000 funded by legal luminary, Aare Afe Babalola in 2009. Then, the three best teams went home with N300, 000, N200, 000 and N100, 000 respectively.” He revealed that registration for the Olubadan Cup will start today and end on October 7, 2020. IFA revealed that it would hold a press conference tomorrow to unveil its programme for the rest of the year. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
