The International Air Transport Association (IATA), has urged Nigeria and other African countries to embrace harmonised safety protocols for better connectivity.
  
The clearing house for 290 airlines globally said the International Civil Aviation Organisation’s (ICAO) Take-Off guidance would aid safe operations across the continent, amid the COVID-19 crisis.
   
IATA said safely re-establishing the continent’s air connectivity was essential to re-building battered economies. IATA also urged African governments to take giant steps in connecting Africa by accelerating the implementation of the Single Africa Air Transport Market (SAATM), to further boost the post-COVID economic recovery.  Other African states like Ghana and Togo are more than 90 per cent, while The Gambia is at about 81 per cent. The implementation of global standards is critical in this crisis and essential to safely restore air connectivity as borders and economies re-open.
  
“This is a positive start, but we are far from restoring the economic catalyst that only aviation can provide. ICAO’s Take-off measures are the bedrock for ensuring safe operations and re-building passenger confidence. Africa’s governments need to make urgent implementation their top aviation priority,” said Albakri.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
