The Coordinator of the Peoples Progressives Alliance (PPA) in London, Anayo Obiakor, has defended business magnate Prince Arthur Eze for criticising the Anambra State Government. In an interview with The Guardian in Awka, yesterday,  Obiakor said the billionaire was right to ask Governor Willie Obiano to account for the council funds given to the state by the Federal Government. The deepening rift between Eze and Obiano widened after the state government suspended for one year the 12 traditional rulers who travelled to Abuja last month for a meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari. The monarchs allegedly sponsored by Eze hit the national capital, reportedly to submit a petition against Obiano to Buhari over the alleged mismanagement of council funds since he (governor) came to power.   However, they could not meet with the President. Obiakor said:  “There is nothing wrong for Arthur Eze to ask Obiano to account for the funds that accrued to councils in the state under his watch. “The government of the day,  paid individuals and organisations should not bring up diversionary measures to Arthur Eze’s quest for council fund accountability. “The suspension of the traditional rulers will neither solve the problem nor sweep the matter under the carpet. The traditional rulers have every right to ask for their five percent share, deducted from the federation account allocation  to  the 21 councils in the state.” He chided community leaders and religious for not commenting  on the alleged mismanagement of council funds by the state government, saying they were not helping the state. The political analyst urged the traditional rulers that were allegedly shortchanged by the state government to demand council elections in the domains. “Anambra State is one of the worst states regarding non-conduct of council polls,” Obiakor said.
