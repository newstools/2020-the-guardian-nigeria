 . NSE records best weekly performance in four months
Following a sharp drop in fixed income yields triggered by further monetary easing by the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), last week, Nigerian equities market recorded its best weekly performance in four months, crossing the 26,000 points for the first time since March 2020. The development caused the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) All-share index, and market capitalisation to appreciate by 2.92% to close the week at 26,319.34 and N13.755 trillion, respectively. All other indices also finished higher with the exception of the NSE ASeM Index, which closed flat. Last week, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Central Bank Nigeria (CBN), reduced the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR), from 12.5% to 11.5%. The decision continued to spur activities and triggered a rally in the stock market. Analysts said the expected third quarter (Q3) earnings reporting season in the midst of the rates crash, and the prevailing low stock valuation have revealed upside potential of companies listed on the stock market. They pointed out the negative returns on other investment windows propelled the flow of funds into equity assets, especially against the backdrop of the untamed inflationary pressures. Analysts at Investdata Consulting Limited, said investors and traders are currently positioning amid changing sentiments in the hope of improved liquidity and positive economic indices. “We expect profit taking as repositioning continues ahead of third quarter-end window dressing and corporate earnings season, despite the negative macroeconomic indices, given the further crash in money market rates, while inflation is at 13.22%, worsening the negative returns on many investment windows “Also, we see investors focusing on portfolio adjustment and rebalancing by targeting companies with strong potentials to grow their Q3 earnings and dividend on the strength of their earnings capacity as the year last quarter is at the corner.” Analysts at Vetiva Securities said: “With the influx of liquidity coming into the equities market on the back of the reduction of the MPR by the MPC during the week, investors reacted positively to the announcement, leading to a number of fundamentally sound stocks closing the week higher. “We expect the positive performance to filter into the coming week as both institutional and retail investors continue to channel their funds into attractive counters. However, given the rally witnessed this week, the possibility of profit taking cannot be overruled.” Also, Codros Limited said: “We expect the market might continue to benefit as domestic investors seek alpha-yielding opportunities in the face of increasingly negative real returns in the fixed income market. However, we advise investors to trade in only fundamentally justified stocks as the weak macro environment remains a significant headwind for listed companies.” A review of market activities last week, indicated that the equities market rebounded on Monday, occasioned by bargain-hunting in most blue-chip stocks, causing the All-Share Index (ASI), to advance by 0.31 per cent.
