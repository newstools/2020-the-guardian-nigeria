No government, however inept, fails to record some form of achievement. It takes real genius to succeed in spending four years actually doing nothing. What it fails to do, or what it does wrongly, deceitfully or prejudicially, is what concerns the citizenry – Wole Soyinka. The nurse’s confession was with much sorrow. She goes home every night thinking of the dreams they killed in the line of duty. The tiny forms of arms and limbs beneath the basin of blood converge to cause her nightmares every night. She started each day never to be a part of abortion routines again, but ends it in the procedure room. “It is the sameness of human failure, of inadequacy in the face of each day’s dull demands,” she said helplessly. For days, I kept recalling her narrative, guilt, helplessness, and started seeing her script played out in the social sphere of our country. I soon came to this conclusion: We do abortions too and kill dreams here. That is what we do; abortions.
  
Abortion is illegal and the nurse recognizes that. “But what do I do, when they keep coming; in need and desperation?’ she said. The nurse has seen all sorts. An 18-year-old fresher that is pregnant for the fourth time. A 48-year-old mother of six that cannot bear another pregnancy. An angry 56-year-old woman in a failed birth control episode. A 16-year-old orphan, uneducated, and victim of rape. A late thirty-something that only detected genotype incompatibility after pregnancy, and so on. “Each abortion is a measure of our failure to protect, to nourish our own. Each basin I empty is a promise – but a promise broken a long time ago.”  Things are so awkward that even as a scholar with the right qualifications, you need to know someone in the presidency, a serving Senator, House of Reps member, someone highly placed to be considered for employment in tertiary institutions. It no longer matters even if you emerged the best or the most qualified. That is not a country of our founding fathers or one we used to know while growing up. It is a mediocre system that prefers who you know and the quality of eye-service than the brains between the ears. It is not one that inspires hope for the young or the unborn.  It should therefore not surprise anyone that Tradermoni scheme beneficiaries are unable to repay the N10, 000 loans, as reported the other day. They are petty businesses that didn’t foresee that their benefactor would raise the bar midway and drain off the investment with wicked policies. Buhari/Osinbajo’s antidote for hardship is more hardships. More people are out of jobs than the one-million-jobs a year this government promised but never kept since 2015. Yet, beleaguered Nigerians need to be squeezed off their meagre earnings to build infrastructure and empower both the greed and kleptomaniac disposition of the political class? So, how come this government has in five years borrowed more than others?  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
