Kano State Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, yesterday, applauded the All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship candidate, Osagie Ize-Iyamu, for what he described as his impressive outing during the debate organised by Channels Television last Sunday. A statement issued in Benin City by his Chief Press Secretary, Abba Anwar, quoted Ganduje as saying, “What happened during the debate, organised by Channels Television and other stakeholders between Ize-Iyamu and his Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) counterpart, Godwin Obaseki, shows that, ours is an issue-based process. “In all the areas discussed during the debate, it appears to all that the APC is ready to take Edo State to higher levels. Our outlined programmes in the areas of security, education, health and others show that our party is determined to better the living condition of Edo people.” Ganduje, who is Chairman of APC Gubernatorial Election Council, described how Ize-Iyamu challenged governor Obaseki, saying that he (Ize-Iyamu) showed a thorough understanding of all the issues. “Looking at the trend and manner in which the debate went, it appears to all that APC is in top gear and determined to win the Saturday election,” he said. Ganduje, said judging from the debate between the APC candidate and Governor Obaseki, the party would emerge victorious, adding, “Edo State and its people will be saved from the clutches of underdevelopment and retardation.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
