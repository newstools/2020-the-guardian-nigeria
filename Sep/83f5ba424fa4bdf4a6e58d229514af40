Of these, there were three new positive tests,” the Premier League said in a statement. All players or club staff who have tested positive will self-isolate for a period of 10 days. Earlier on Monday, Manchester City confirmed that Riyad Mahrez and Aymeric Laporte had tested positive but were not displaying symptoms of the virus.
