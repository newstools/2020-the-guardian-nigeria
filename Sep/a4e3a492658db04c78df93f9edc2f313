Though his leadership is tenured, Revd. Fr. Akee Joachim has approached the task of leading Tiger Golf Club, Ojoo, Ibadan with all the zeal usually exhibited by owners that want to make their property one of the best in their vicinity. The new captain of the club located inside the Second Division of the Nigeria Army, Odogbo Barracks, Ojoo, has taken his assignment with such aplomb that members are beginning to congratulate themselves for choosing him as their captain. Revd. Fr. Joachim has highlighted membership drive, course maintenance, financial discipline and competitions as his four cardinal programmes towards improving the standard of the club.  “The quality of members usually determine the atmosphere of the club and so, we will review the criteria for the admittance of new members.”
 
On course maintenance, Fr. Joachim described the love of the game as what draws all golfers to the club, adding, “I have played on many courses across the globe and I want to add that exposure and experience to bear in the maintenance and management of our course. “I will ensure members enjoy the course during my tenure by putting in place necessary facilities to keep it in good shape. Training of our course staff will be a major priority of my administration in view of the sensitive equipment we use for maintenance.” Revd. FR. Joachim also revealed his plan to reach out and encourage new sponsors and corporate bodies in partnering the club to keep the course and club house busy all year round, adding that he would introduce novelty competitions to encourage mass participation of members and golfers from other clubs.
 
“We will encourage inter-club match plays and affiliation with other golf clubs, just as we shall also sustain and improve on our major annual tournaments,” the captain said. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
