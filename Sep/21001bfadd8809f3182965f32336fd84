Themed ‘Enabling Clearer Vision for a Cleaner Environment,’ the event addressed boosting morale among the agency’s staff for effective performance and increased awareness for environmental sustainability. Speaking on the essence of the partnership-driven initiative, General Manager, LASEPA, Dr Dolapo Fasawe, said: “As a public health professional, I observed through my encounter with the staff that as a result of failing vision, they often produced suboptimal results, which informed my major inspiration for the free eye care programme to further engage and inspire them for better performance.” Fasawe added that the environment plays vital roles in determining the good health and well-being of the people, hence the all-important need of advancing the physical, social and mental health of the agency’s staff. In addition to free eye checks, the benefiting staff received consultations, reading glasses and medicals at no cost. While thanking Kingstripes Care Foundation for the collaboration, Fasawe said the agency’s staff would continue to benefit from the yearly event.
