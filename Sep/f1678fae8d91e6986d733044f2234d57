Ebonyi State Governor David Umahi at the weekend insisted that he would play no part in choosing his successor. Umahi, who was re-elected for a second term last year, will finish his tenure in   2023. The governor said in a statement by his  Commissioner for Information and State Orientation,  Uchenna Orji, that he was at present focused on completing the projects started by his administration. He expressed his belief that the right person would succeed him. According to the statement,  Umahi stated these when he hosted prominent Ebonyi indigenes residing in Abuja. The governor, who praised those at the forum for supporting his administration, called for continued peace and unity in the state. He said helping to resolve the long-standing dispute between Ezza and Ezillo is one of his greatest achievements. Umahi promised that his government would complete the airport project before leaving office. The governor, who appealed to investors to help develop the state,  assured them their investments would be protected as he had enacted a  law to protect their businesses despite future government policies. Former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Senator Pius Anyim,  commended the governor for the interaction, calling for more of such meetings. The representative of Ebonyi Central in the Senate, Senator Obinna Ogba, also thanked Umahi for bringing Ebonyi people residents in Abuja together.
