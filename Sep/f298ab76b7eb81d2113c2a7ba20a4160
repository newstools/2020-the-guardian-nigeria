Students in exit classes returned to school in Anambra State yesterday after they were forced to stay at home for months due to COVID-19 threat. Investigations by The Guardian showed that every school enforced strict COVID-19 protocols. The Principal, Urban Girls’ Secondary School, Ekwulobia, Mrs Chioma Nwosu, said that about 80 per cent of her students returned to school and were ready for academic activities. “The students were visibly happy that schools resumed for studies because they were excited at the development. “I also mandated that students without face masks should not enter the school compound until they provide theirs,” she said. Nwosu added that she directed that there must be buckets of water, liquid soaps and hand sanitisers strategically placed in front of every classroom block in observance of coronavirus protocols. Two Junior Secondary School (JSS) students –Adaobi Isaac and Miss Mmesoma Ezeibe – said they were happy that schools had reopened. According to them, they were tired of staying at home. At the Monsignor Maduka Memorial Secondary School, Ekwulobia, a Senior Secondary School (SSS) student, Miss Chinenye Obiefuna, said she participated in the on-the-air lessons, but preferred being in a classroom setting. At National Secondary School, Awka, students were busy with their studies. Those who spoke to The Guardian said that they were happy to resume studies.
