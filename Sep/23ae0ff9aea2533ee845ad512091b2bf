In continuation of its COVID-19 palliative programme, the Defence and Police Officers’ Wives Association (DEPOWA) has donated foodstuffs and relief materials to Divine Hope Orphanage and Less Privileged Home in Kagini, Kubwa, in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). The DEPOWA COVID-19 palliative, the third in its series, was a gesture by the association to cushion the economic hardship encountered by vulnerable groups and persons, particularly, widows, orphans and the physically challenged. Speaking at the event, DEPOWA President, Mrs Omobolanle Olonisakin, said the gesture would address the essential and immediate needs of the children. She urged the management of the orphanage to ensure the items were judiciously utilised for the benefit of the children. The president, who was represented by the Vice President, Mrs Abies Oghomwen, disclosed that the palliative would be sustained. She expressed the association’s continuous commitment towards assisting humanity as part of its cardinal objectives. While appreciating DEPOWA, the proprietor of the orphanage, Mr. Chinedu Chibuzor, thanked the body for the gesture, adding that it would encourage and support the orphanage’s effort at grooming the children and catering for their needs. Items donated included mattresses, pillowcases, bed-sheets, bags of rice, beans, maize, noodles, vegetable oil, beverages, sanitary packs, among others. Over 1,300 persons, including families of serving military personnel, widows and orphans of fallen military personnel had benefited from the first and second phases of the palliative outreach in Abuja and its environs.
