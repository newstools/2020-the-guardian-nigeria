A former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria Obadiah Mailafia has received a third invitation from the Department of State Security. According to The Nation, the secret police requested Mailafia to appear in its office on Monday, September 14 by 11am. “I have once again (for the 3rd time) been ordered to appear before the DSS at their Jos HQ this coming Monday 14th September at 11.00 am,” he told The Nation on Friday. “This is in addition to our battle in court, as my lawyer appears before a Jos High Court on Friday, September 11, seeking a restraining order against the DIG Criminal Investigations Department (CID) who are also pursuing me,” he added. He added that his life was in danger because certain political forces were bent on silencing him. He said he was disgusted for being subjected to criminal investigation in Nigeria for speaking the truth having spent over 20 years teaching abroad with unblemished record. “I spent over 20 years of my working life abroad as a university teacher, banker and international civil servant with unblemished record. Mailafia questioned by the DSS over a radio interview where he alleged a Northern Governor was Boko Haram commander. He was invited twice to DSS and released unconditionally. Thereafter, the criminal investigation unit of the police asked him to appear for criminal investigation. Mailafia declined and approached the Jos High Court seeking a restraining order against the police. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
