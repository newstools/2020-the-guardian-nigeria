The government named target beneficiaries of the scheme include mechanics, taxi drivers, hairdressers, keke NAPEP riders, Okada riders, plumbers, electricians among others. It said the beneficiaries are to be drawn from 12 states, including Lagos, Bauchi, Kaduna, Kano, Plateau, Borno, Ekiti, Anambra, Abia, Kogi, Ondo, and the FCT respectively for this first phase of the scheme. The Minister of State for Industry, Trade and Investment, Ambassador Mariam Yalwaji Katagum, made this known in Abuja, while briefing journalists on the government’s preparation for the anniversary. Katagum, who is also the Chairperson, Steering Committee of the Scheme, disclosed that each beneficiary would be given a one-off payment of N30, 000. According to her, about 174,574 MSME operators have so far registered for the Scheme, with five states recording the highest.
