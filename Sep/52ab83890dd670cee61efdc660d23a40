The Nigerian Union of Journalists (NUJ, yesterday, restated its determination in ensuring that government does not tamper with freedom of information and expression of citizens, insisting that they were fundamental human rights. National President of NUJ, Chris Isiguzo, who spoke at the International Day for Universal Access to Information (IDUAI) 2020, said the union’s resolution necessitated the decision to stand against the anti-people, draconian hate speech bill, and social media bill at the National Assembly. “We stood against them, we are still standing against them and we will continue to do so because any law that decides to pigeonhole Nigerians, or stop us from free expression will be completely rejected,” he said. He stressed that the reason was not far fetched because the unique ingredients of responsible democracy remained the people’s right to freely express themselves.
