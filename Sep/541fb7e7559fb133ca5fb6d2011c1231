Anthony Joshua | The Drum Many Nigerians love the idea of a lavish burial ceremony when a parent passes. This long-standing trend has been a source of argument on social media as many have condemned lavish burials especially if the organiser did not take “proper care” of the deceased while alive. British-Nigerian boxing heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua has now also opined that throwing one’s parents lavish burials is an effort in futility if one did not give them befitting lives. Taking to Snapchat to express his thought, the dad of one wrote: “Dear children you can’t give your parents a befitting burial while you didn’t give them a befitting live. They can’t see your love after they are gone or see you true affection from the coffin. Give your mother or father a hug or a call and express your gratitude today. If you don’t have a good relationship with your mother or father this message is not for you.” Earlier this year, the boxer took centre stage on Commonwealth Day which was celebrated at the Westminster Abbey and attended by members of the British Royal Family. Joshua who was selected to speak on Commonwealth Day used the opportunity to celebrate his Nigerian heritage. He used his speech to canvass for unity,  noting that togetherness is ”a beautiful thing”. “A thing to be celebrated and cherished, and a great source of peace and stability. “I feel opportunity should be there for the taking along with hard work, dedication, and perseverance, regardless of one’s background. “It takes a village to raise a child. And in the same vein, it takes a whole community to act and stand together to tackle some of the challenges we are confronted with today. To round off his speech, Joshua summed his identity as a Briton and a Nigerian: “So here’s to fish and chips, egusi soup and pounded yam. “To the UK and Nigeria, and the children of the Commonwealth.”
