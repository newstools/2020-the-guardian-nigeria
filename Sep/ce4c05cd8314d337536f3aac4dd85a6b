In an international webinar marking this year’s ceremony, the firm emerged as the nation’s top security risk management company in a keenly contested selection process. According to the OSPAs organizers, the winners were selected by an esteemed panel of industry figures who judged entries using the same criteria, which is applied across the world. Each winner demonstrated that they have performed at an exceptional level within the security sector. Reacting, the Group Managing Director, Halogen Group, Mr Wale Olaoye, described the award as a vindication of the company’s commitment to global best practices, uncompromising commitment to excellence and its focused investment in technology and capacity building.
