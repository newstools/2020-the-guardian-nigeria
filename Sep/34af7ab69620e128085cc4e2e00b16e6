Heaps of refuse in Idiaraba area of Lagos Mushin, Idi Araba and environs in Lagos are plagued with the double problems of overfilled drainages and heaps of refuse waiting to be evacuated. At the smallest drop of the rain, the streets are littered with household waste materials, plastics, sachet water nylons and bottles, mixed with arid smell from refuse heaps. From Mushin, Lawanson, Ojuelegba through Garibu Musa to Idiaraba, the nauseating sights are the same. Residents say the drainage channels have been turned into dumpsites, which have gone unchallenged for the past six years. According to shop owners in the area, the negligence of PSP operators and the Lagos State Waste Management Authority (LAWMA) in prompt evacuation of refuse has encouraged the continued reckless disposal of waste by the roadsides. Some residents of Garibu Musa in Idiaraba said they were afraid of an outbreak of an epidemic in the area if the present situation is not addressed. Mohammed Ruffai, a shop owner in Garibu Musa market, said: “The situation has been very bad and we have been struggling with the stench for a very long time. The government officials were here some time ago to work. They evacuated dirt from the waterway, but left it unpacked till date. Even the refuse brought out from the canal was left to litter the roadside. We plead with the state and local government to help us evacuate the dirt and enforce strict observance of the environmental laws.” Eucharia Blessing said: “Despite the awareness going on about coronavirus and the need to keep a personal hygiene, everybody is trying his or her possible best to keep away from germs and make the environment safe, but now our streets are all littered with waste. We want them to please come in and pack our wastes regularly.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
