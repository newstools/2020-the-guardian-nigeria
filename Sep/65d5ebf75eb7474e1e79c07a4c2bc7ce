West vowed not to release new music until he is free from his contract with Sony and Universal. “I’m not putting no more music out till I’m done with my contract with Sony and Universal. On God … in Jesus’ name … come and get me,” he tweeted. In a reference to Moses, the biblical prophet and leader who led the Israelites out of Egypt, West promised to fight for all musicians to get ownership of their masters. “I need to see everybody’s contracts at Universal and Sony. I’m not gonna watch my people be enslaved. I’m putting my life on the line for my people. The music industry and the NBA are modern-day slave ships I’m the new Moses.” On Wednesday, he added: “The artist deserve to own our masters … artist are starving without tours … Ima go get our masters … for all artist … pray for me” “In the streaming world master ownership is everything… that is the bulk of the income … in COVID artist need our masters … it’s more important than ever before.” West also shared the screenshots of the contract he signed with Universal in 2011, minutes after he tweeted: “THIS MOMENT IS GOING TO CHANGE THE MUSIC INDUSTRY FOR GOOD … I FEEL SO HUMBLED AND BLESSED THAT GOD HAS PUT ME IN A STRONG ENOUGH POSITION TO DO THIS … EVERYONE KEEP PRAYING … ITS WORKING … I AM ON MY KNEES THIS MORNING”
