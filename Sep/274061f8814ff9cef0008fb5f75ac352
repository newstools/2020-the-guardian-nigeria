Six banks in Ghana have initiated services to allow the public pay for goods and services through the universal Ghana Quick Response (Gh QR) code.
   
The banks include three from Nigeria, which are Ecobank, Zenith Bank, and Fidelity Bank. Others, including GCB Bank, Bank of Africa, and Agriculture Development Bank are Ghana-based.
   
According to a statement, the remaining banks are still in the process to enable them begin the rollout.
   
With the QR code, customers only needed to scan the codes displayed at various shops and other outlets with their smartphones to make payment.  “Once you find the QR Code displayed, you just have to scan and you pay or dial the USSD code and pay, it is that convenient. Gh QR is universal so anyone can use any of them, regardless of your bank,” Hesse stressed.
    
A wide range of businesses including taxi drivers, small shops, super markets, pharmacies, chop bars, restaurants as well as major service providers can all use QR codes to accept payments, he explained.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
