The National Industrial Court (NIC) has put to an end controversies on jurisdictional scope between workers in the printing and publishing sector. 
 
The controversy on jurisdictional scope is between Association Pulp Paper and Paper Products, Printing and Publishing Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (PPAPPPAPSSAN) and National Union of Printing, Publishing and Paper Products Workers (NUPPPPROW). PPAPPPAPSSAN argued that every effort of the union to settle the over two decades of controversies out of court proved abortive. 
 
It said the confusion was capitalised on by employers in the industry to choose which of the two unions to operate in the company rather than having the two simultaneously as provided in labour laws. It said this was in spite of several clarifications by the Federal Ministry of Labour and Employment on the matter.  PPAPPPAPSSAN said it became necessary given the controversy it has generated in the industry especially in government newspapers and government press in the 36 states of the federation and Abuja.
