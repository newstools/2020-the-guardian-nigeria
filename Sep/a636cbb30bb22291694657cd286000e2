They made the pledge at the signing of the peace deal held at  Oba Akenzua Cultural Centre, Benin. The peace deal was brokered by chairman of the National Peace Committee and former Head General Abdulsalami Abubakar (rtd) and the Bishop of the Sokoto Diocese of the Catholic Church, Bishop Mathew Kukah. Security is a major concern ahead of Saturday’s poll, with fears of clashes between rival supporters as witnessed during campaigns. Among the personalities at the event were Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Professor Mahmood Yakubu, Representative of the Inspector-General of Police (IGP), DIG Adeleye Oyebade, and representatives of the Benin Monarch. Bishop Kukah warned that the signing of the peace accord shouldn’t be seen as a “mere ceremony.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
