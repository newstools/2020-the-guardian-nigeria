The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) gubernatorial candidate in the last general election in Kano State, Abba Kabir Yusuf has accused Governor Abdullah Umar Ganduje of violating rule of law and due process on alleged sales of public property. Besides, Abba has petitioned the Chief Justice of Nigeria, (CJN), Ibrahim Tanko Muhammad and Nigeria Judicial Council (NJC), requesting their urgent intervention on what he considered an abuse of power and breach of rules of law by Ganduje. In a petition filed by his counsel Bashir Yusuf Mohammad and addressed to the attorney general and commissioner for Justice, Kano state, the Yusuf claimed that the state government is already tampering with the public property which are already a subject of litigation. Yusuf had dragged the state government before the state high court challenging the legality and validity of the state government to sale or diversion of former Daula hotel and multi-layer storey Shahuci parking space. In the civil suits, which came up in 27th August 2020, the PDP stalwart asked the court to declare the alleged sales of the public property as null and void. He argued that Governor Gandujeâ€™s tampering with the property amount to undue interference in a court process, an action he claimed contradict the law. While demanding an immediate stay of action, Yusuf urged the attorney general to advise the state government appropriately. He warned that any further tampering on the sales of the property, while the case is still subject to court dispensation, will amount to disrespect to rule of law. Attorney general M. A. Lawan refuses to respond on the matter.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
