Kano Pillars have not been able to resume regular training at the Sani Abacha Stadium, Kano, as the pitch has been converted to an isolation centre for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Although Kano State government has designed the facility to Private Sector Coalition against COVID-19, led by Alhaji Aliko Dangote Foundation, the 500 beds stretch treatment facility is still under construction. Malikawa disclosed that Bauchi State Commissioner for Youths and Sports, Adamu Manu, had conveyed the authorisation to management of the club at the new secretariat along UDB Road. He assured Kano Pillars’ fans of peaceful atmosphere at Tafawa Balewa Stadium as guaranteed by Bauchi State Government to support their darling club. “I wish to confirm that Kano Pillars have adopted Bauchi Stadium for the 2020/2021 CAF. We received the approval from Bauchi State Government yesterday through the commissioner for sports at our new secretariat in Bauchi. The commissioner has gladly confirmed the approval of Governor Bala Mohammad and we are very much glad about that. “I can assure our teeming fans and supporters that the Tafawa Balewa Stadium is convenient enough to accommodate them and there is peaceful atmosphere as guaranteed by the state government.” “The Bauchi government has pledged to render all necessary support to Pillars during the campaign to ensure we come out in flying colours,” Malikawa said.
