A Pan-Yoruba socio-cultural organisation, Afenifere, has described the latest invitation for memoranda by the Senate for constitution review as a ritual every four years without tangible progress, insisting that restructuring is the only way forward. The group noted that it would be sad if the country were taken through another motion without movement in the midst of its constitution disorder. Afenifere, at a virtual meeting presided over by its leader, Chief Reuben Fasoranti, recommended the reports of the 2014 National Conference and other positions on restructuring as a basis of a meaning new constitutional order for Nigeria. The group also described the Water Resources Bill as dangerous, saying it seeks to convert waterways to Rural Grazing Area (RUGA) facilities for the Federal Government. Besides, the group has described the increase in prices of petroleum products and electricity tariffs as insensitive against a people being ravaged by a national pandemic without adequate support from the government. It said: “To ask Nigerians to pay more for these facilities is wickedness and inhumane. We call on the people to use all constitutional and peaceful means to resist and reject the hike. “Also, we reject the gaffe by the Federal Government that the Yoruba states security initiative Amotekun will function under the Inspector-General of Police (IGP). We fully back our governors that being a product of law by federating units, the outfit should be independent and not be muzzled under the failure of single police that necessitated it in the first place. Seeking to take over Amotekun negates the truthfulness of the government that it has commenced restructuring.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
