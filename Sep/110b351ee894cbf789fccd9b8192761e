Nigeria Police on Sunday said it has begun searching for a policeman who was caught smoking shisha in uniform. “The Nigeria Police Force has commenced investigations into the viral video showing a man wearing what appears to be a Nigeria Police “uniform” smoking shisha,” the police tweeted. The video was published on social media platforms on Saturday with an unidentified in a police uniform smoking at the back of a house. While the time, location and identity of the person is yet unknown, the police said it is investigating the incident. The investigation, according to the police, “will amongst other things seek to forensically establish the authenticity of the video, the true identity of the man in the uniform – whether he is, in fact, a policeman, an impostor or an actor in a movie scene. “However, while not being prejudicial to the ongoing investigations, it is necessary to state that the character exhibited by the man in the uniform is not a true reflection of who we are as a regimented law enforcement agency – our training, discipline, norms and tradition.” The force urged members of the public with useful information to assist police investigations via the following; pressforabuja@police.gov.ng, or private messages across social media platforms.
