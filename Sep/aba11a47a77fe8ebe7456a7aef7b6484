The world must “oppose politicization and stigmatization” over Covid-19, Xi said in the pre-recorded address, urging world leaders to embrace the “concept of a big family… and avoid falling into the trap of a clash of civilizations.” The US and China are eyeballing each other over a raft of issues: the origins of the coronavirus, trade and tech dominance, security and disputed seas. The US has called China out over its ambitions to control the strategically pivotal South China Sea as well as for its bid to crush democracy movements in Hong Kong and Taiwan. But Xi reassured world leaders his country had no desire for “hegemony, expansion or sphere of influence.” “China has no intention to enter a Cold War with any country,” he said, insisting Beijing is instead a bulwark of international systems such as the World Trade Organization and a willing partner in the face of diplomatic spats. “We insist on dialogue to bridge differences and negotiation to resolve disputes,” he added.
