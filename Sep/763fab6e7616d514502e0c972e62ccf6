 PHOTO: ARSENAL.COM  The 28-year-old Argentine, who has signed a four-year deal, helped Arsenal to FA Cup victory last season and Community Shield glory last month but faced playing second fiddle to Bernd Leno. Villa boss Dean Smith said: “We are really pleased with the signing of our new goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez. “We know how highly Arsenal rated him and we watched his outstanding performances last season in a trophy-winning top side. “We moved for Emi when we saw the opportunity, as it is rare to be able to buy a top-class goalkeeper who hasn’t yet reached their peak age and who can therefore be a key player for our club for the long term.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
