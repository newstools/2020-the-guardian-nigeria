Nigerian Association of Resident Doctors (NARD) has called off the nationwide strike it embarked on September 7, 2020, over non-implementation of residency funding, COVID-19 allowance, hazard allowance as well as the outstanding salary shortfall of 2014, 2015 and 2016. Publicity Secretary of the association, Dr. Stanley Egbogu, told The Guardian yesterday that the suspension followed the meeting between NARD and the Federal government on Wednesday where the latter agreed to begin payment of June COVID-19 inducement and medical residency allowance. Also, NARD President, Dr. Aliyu Sokonda, stated: “Following our meeting yesterday with the government, we had a National Executive Council meeting and resolved to suspend our strike to give government time to address our demands. So the strike is suspended for two weeks.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
