 Peters Adeyemi  Let us talk about the current disagreement between the Federal Government and the Joint Action Committee of NASU and SSANU. What are the issues?	
Basically, I think our responsibility has thrown us into this crisis. We want to show to the world that we in NASU and SSANU are responsible trade unions and to support the Federal Government’s measure to instil probity and accountability in the system.
   
There was a time when there was shortfall in personnel emoluments where the government was not able to fully fund personnel emolument in the universities, and the idea was mooted that if we had keyed into IPPIS, this problem of shortfall in personnel emolument where universities were paying in 60%, 70% salaries of workers would not have been there.  What is the level of interaction between the unions and ministries of education and labour at finding solutions to the challenge?	
For the Minister of Education, there are issues that have been outstanding and some of these issues include our earned allowance and a few others. So, when he was reappointed both NASU and SSANU wrote to congratulate him and used the opportunity to seek an audience with him, with a view to discussing a whole lot of issues affecting the sector.  We did this last year and we are yet to receive a response from him. 
   
In fairness to the Minister of Labour and Employment, once or twice he and his team in the Ministry tried to organise a virtual meeting, but we refused on the ground that the issues are straightforward and clear.
