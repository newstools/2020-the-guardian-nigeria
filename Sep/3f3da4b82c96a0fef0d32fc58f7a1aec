We’re ready for peace, says Miyetti Allah Again, armed bandits, yesterday attacked Adara community in Kajuru Council of Kaduna State, killing three natives and taking seven hostage. This was amid efforts by the state government to promote peace among the natives and the Fulani in the southern part of Kaduna. Adara Development Association (ADA) has, however, condemned the invasion of the community by the armed men suspected to be Fulani herders. A statement signed by the President of ADA, Awemi Maisamari, read in part: “Today, September 6, 2020 at 2a.m., Adara community in Buda Ward of Kajuru Council came under another deadly attack from suspected Fulani militia. The premeditated and unprovoked attack claimed the lives of Rev. Alubara Audu, Adamu Tata and Ishaku Peter.” He also listed those that were kidnapped in the area to include Sani Peter and Esther Peter. Maisamari added: “About the same time, the terrorists abducted five people from neighbouring Kemara Rimi community of Buda Ward namely Ojo Aminu, Danfulani Makaranta, Namiji Gwamna, Ali Musa and Grace Mathew. “These callous and barbaric attacks sometimes abate, but never really stop in Adara community.” According to Adara leaders, with the continuation of such hostilities by Fulani herders, even when various peace moves are being initiated, “it becomes clearer that the purported dialogue is serving as a diversion to allow the attackers continue their activities. We are left wondering whether it is worthwhile engaging in such peace talks if this continues.” Insisting that Governor Nasir el-Rufai’s demand for details of occupied villages in southern Kaduna had since been met, the community leaders added: “Any further failure to adequately address these issues will be a confirmation that government is only interested in reeling out rhetoric.”The Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Mohammed Jalige, did not respond to inquiries on the incident. MEANWHILE, the Kaduna State Chapter of Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN) has commended the federal and state governments’ effort to restore peace in southern Kaduna, expressing readiness to make peace with aggrieved communities. MACBAN made this known in a communiqué issued at the end of a peace summit in Kafanchan yesterday.While promising to expose all trouble-makers and criminals in the area and make them face the law, the cattle breeders called for the establishment of the community-based security committee, with membership from all ethnic groups in the area. In the communiqué signed by the Chairman, Hassan Tugga; Southern Kaduna Zonal Chairman; Abdulhamid Musa; Zonal Secretary, Shuaibu Usman; and Director, Media and Publicity, Ibrahim Zango, the association urged governments to compensate those who had lost cows and other valuables to clashes in the area. Security operatives and other government officials attended the peace summit. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
