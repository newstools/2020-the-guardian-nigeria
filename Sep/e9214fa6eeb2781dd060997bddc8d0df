Our only threats are the police, tax force and LASTMA officials who are ready to swoop on any bus, stopping at the bus stop to pick or drop passengers. Just last week, the situation led to serious crisis and riots at Abule-Egba when the task force people killed one of our members.”
 
However, Kazeem Jimoh, a legal practitioner who rides daily on the road, urged residents to look at the bright sides of the initiative. “Before COVID-19, I observed that students, workers and traders faced difficulties while commuting on the road. The BRT scheme is helping to address this now, reduce travel time and keep people healthy in the state. Also, it is just a matter of time before owners of private vehicles will get to park those vehicles and take public transport. This is what we should be looking at,” he said.
 
On addressing the gridlock, Jimoh offered: “I have seen traffic officials doing their best to manage the situation at Iyana-Ipaja, Ikeja-Along, Airport and PWD. However, they have to be more strategic about managing traffic, particularly during peak periods.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
