Suspected bandits have killed five farmers at Yanteba village in Malumfashi Local Government Area of Katsina State. The farmers were said to have been killed in the early hours of Friday morning at about 3:00 am. The bandits stormed the village on a reprisal attack after three of their colleagues were killed by community members. The incident is coming a week after three farmers were killed by bandits in Dandume council area. A spokesperson for the police command in the state, SP Gambo Isah confirmed the incident. Gambo said the bandits “stormed Yanteba village at about 3:00 am on Thursday and started shooting their guns which led to the death of the farmers. “The bandits came to the village on a reprisal attack because their three brothers were attacked two days ago. “The youths of Yanteba village saw three herders passing through their village and they gathered and attacked them which led to the death of one person and two others sustained injuries. “Police officer from Malumfashi Division rushed to the village and rescued those that did not die. “Two days after the attack on the Fulani youth, the bandits came for a revenge mission where they killed five people.” He, however, called on the citizens of the state to stop taking laws into their hands by arbitrarily attacking herdsmen. Isah said whenever rural dwellers come across the bandits, they should inform security agents and avoid confronting them. He called members of the public to provide information about the movements and whereabouts of bandits to the security agents for action.
