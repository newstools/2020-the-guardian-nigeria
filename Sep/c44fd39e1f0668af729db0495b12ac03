Agro Renewal Movement International (ARMI) Limited, in collaboration with Agro Empire Estate, has implemented an agro-allied and processing project in Ogun State to transform and boost the sector.
  
According to the Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, ARMI, Mustafa Moshood Adedapo, the project, which sits on 500 acres of farmland, would provide farmers, technicians and other stakeholders in the agricultural sector the opportunity to invest in plantain, livestock and other crops, plant and animal breeding, processing, storage and packaging, as well as artificial dams for irrigation, among others.  “Food security is not just making sure there is enough to eat in just one place, we want to make sure that the system works and the connection to logistics works, that access to the market works and that our farmers are empowered and making enough money,” he added.
