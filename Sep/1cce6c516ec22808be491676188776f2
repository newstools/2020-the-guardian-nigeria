Eight members of a dreaded cult group, Black Axe, also known as Aiye, have been arrested by operatives of the Ogun State Police Command while mourning one of their members who died recently.
 
The spokesman of the command, Abimbola Oyeyemi, said the cult members were nabbed on September 24.
 
Oyeyemi said the cultists were arrested following a report lodged at Ogijo Police Station where a 16-year-old boy, Onome Iduru, was rushed to after he was shot in the stomach by the cultists, who were in procession in honour of their departed colleague.
 
The cultists, after shooting the victim, dispossessed him of his phone and also went ahead to unleash terror on the community.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
