The Groningen-based company said its priority was to establish contact with the kidnappers, Radings said, describing the situation as worrisome. Following the attack, the 4,800-tonne ship and 16 other crew who were unharmed, arrived safely in Lagos, where the vessel was escorted to its berth by the Nigerian navy. The incident took place in a stretch of the Gulf of Guinea that has a notorious reputation for piracy. According to the International Maritime Bureau (IMB), 77 seafarers worldwide were taken hostage or kidnapped for ransom in the first half of 2020. The Gulf of Guinea accounted for 90 percent of abductions. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
