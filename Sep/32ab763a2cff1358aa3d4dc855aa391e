A Hawker 4000 luxury aircraft in the Nigerian Presidential Air Fleet (PAF), has been put up for auction, and it may cost as much as N8 billion ($20 million) for interested buyers.
  
The Guardian yesterday learnt that the relatively new aircraft has been underutilised, and now put up for sale as part of cost-cutting measures.
  
The Federal Government (FG), four years ago, put two of its 10 airplanes up for sale. The cutback measure was not unconnected with the estimated use of N5 billion on maintaining the PAF in 15 months.  
  
In an advertorial published last Wednesday, the government invited buyers to the Hawker 4000 aircraft with registration number 5N-FGX/: RC 066. The business-size jet entered into service in December 2011. It has capacity for nine passengers and three crew members.
