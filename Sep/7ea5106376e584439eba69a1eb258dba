Sources on the set said the cast and crew had been sent home after receiving a memo that one of the team was struck by the virus. Robert Pattinson stars as Bruce Wayne (the character identified as Batman). Earlier in March, Pattinson had to stay back in the UK, along with other cast members, when filming was originally suspended in March following the outbreak of the pandemic. “The Batman” has approximately three months of filming left and hopes to be done filming by the end of the year as it is expected to be released to the cinemas in October next year.
