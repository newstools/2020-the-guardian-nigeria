Saddened by the rot in the country’s education system, Kings College Old Boys Association (KCOBA) will this weekend engage government and stakeholders in a teleconference to chart path on how to revamp the sector during and after the pandemic.
 
The conference, which will also commemorate the 111th annual founder’s day on September 19, will have the Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo and Deputy Secretary-General, United Nations, Amina Muhammed lead the dialogue on fixing the challenges that have bedevilled the education system.
 
According to the Kingsweek Committee Chairman, Pastor Ituah Ighodalo, the teleconference would feature keynote lecture themed: ‘Education, the Way Forward’ and panel discussions on alternative funding models (PPP), technology, new ways of learning and digital divide, such as access to internet and devices to develop a more efficient educational system.
 
He listed the panelists to include the Minister of State for Education, Chukwuemeka Nwajuiba; Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) President, Olumide Apkpata; National Security Adviser, Babagana Monguno; former Emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi; President, St. Gregory College Old Boys Association, Justice Adeniyi Adetokunbo Ademola (rtd); former Chief Technology Officer, Microsoft, Hakeem Adeniji-Adele and Lagos Commissioner for Health, Prof. Akin Abayomi, among others.
 
Ighodalo, who would be moderating the session, said the theme of the lecture is apt as the country’s education system is gradually losing its value in the world, adding that no nation could afford to neglect educating its populace.	According to him, the country’s education system needs to be transformed to regain losses during and after the pandemic.
