The Federal Housing Authority (FHA) has begun the assessment of housing schemes in Abuja. The newly inaugurated management assured citizens that low-cost housing units would be realisable, and expressed Federal Government’s commitment to deploy adequate funds to hasten the process.
 
Speaking while inspecting housing projects in Abuja, the Managing Director, Senator Gbenga Ashafa, said the on the spot assessment of facilities was to equip the new management with facts on its projects. Ashafa said,  “this tour is to give us first hand information about the activities of the Authority because some of the issues that may arise will be part of the problems we may be required to attend to. “It is therefore good that we have inspected the projects on ground, so that we will be in a better position to address them as they come, having seen things physically.”
 
He explained that most of the issues on site would form the bulk of what will come to their desks for attention. Ashafa called on Nigerians to form cooperative societies to hasten access to mortgage packages. Similarly, the FHA boss called on Nigerians to access mortgage through registered organisations. Also, the Managing Director, Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria (FMBN) Ahmed Dangiwa, an architect, urged private developers to tap into the government’s ease of doing business and funding options available in bank.
