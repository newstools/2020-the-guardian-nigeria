The toddler was seen smiling and waving at her mother during Williams’ third-round win against Sloane Stephens inside Arthur Ashe Stadium on Saturday. “She loves when I practice on this court because she can sit and watch,” Williams said after beating Greece’s Maria Sakkari in the last 16 on Arthur Ashe. “She’s three now. I’m like, ‘I gotta put my career aside and get her a racquet in her hand. “Seriously, that’s what I told my husband yesterday. I’m like, ‘We got to get a racquet in her hand,” Williams added.
