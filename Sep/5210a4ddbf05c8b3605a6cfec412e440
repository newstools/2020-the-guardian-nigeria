Congress voted last week to open impeachment proceedings against Vizcarra for “moral incapacity” over accusations he incited aides to lie to anti-graft investigators. Viscarra’s government had sought the court injunction on the grounds that Congress was not competent to rule on the president’s moral capacity. However Ledesma said the seven-member court “has decided to admit the competency claim to proceedings” but pointed out that ruling would take several weeks. Ledesma said that meanwhile, “in light of the declarations of political leaders, the risk of vacancy (of the office of president) has been weakened and there is no manifest urgency.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
