The French Container Transportation and Shipping Company, CMA CGM has announced the suspension of the application of the peak season surcharge on ships calling in Nigeria. The suspension is expected to take effect from  October 1, 2020 to commemorate the nation’s day of independence. The move is said to be in line with that of the Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) that had earlier suspended application of the surcharge from September 1, 2020 as a result of protests by Shippers’ Council and Stakeholders. According to the Head, Public Relations of the Council, Rakiya Zubairu, the suspension of the peak season surcharge was contained in a letter sent to the Executive Secretary/Chief Exevutive Officer  of the Nigerian Shippers’ Council, Mr Hassan Bello, earlier today from the Head Office of CMA CGM in Marseilles France.
