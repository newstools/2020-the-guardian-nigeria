In its determination to boost mechanised farming, the Delta State government has inaugurated 20 tractors. Governor Ifeanyi Okowa disclosed that the tractors were to encourage citizens to go back to farming as a sustainable means of livelihood. Okowa, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Olisa Ifeajika, explained that the equipment would be available to every farmer to boost farm mechainisation, reduce drudgery and increase productivity, adding that the essence was to ensure subsidized farm equipment services. According to the governor, “10 of the tractors will go to the tractor agencies of the state government under the Ministry of Agriculture and 10 will be given out to the private sector at subsidised rates. “Those in whose custody the tractors would be must be readily available to provide the necessary services to other farmers, who would be in need of them at an agreed price with the ministry,” he added. Earlier, the Commissioner for Agriculture, Mr Julius Egbedi, who commended the governor for supporting different agricultural programmes, said the state-assisted mechanisation programme had provided farmers in the state with machines to facilitate farmland preparation and reduce the task of tilling the soil manually.
