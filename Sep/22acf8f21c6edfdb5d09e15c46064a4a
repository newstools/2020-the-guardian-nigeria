Strong signals that the number of women in the National Assembly would increase emerged yesterday when a female lecturer, Prof. Nora Dadu’ut, clinched the ticket of ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in Plateau State.
 
A staff of the Department of French Studies, University of Jos, Dadu’ut defeated five other aspirants to pick the party’s ticket for the October 31 Plateau South Senatorial District by-election.
 
The seat became vacant last February when the last occupant, Senator Ignatius Longjan, died after representing the zone for just eight months. Plateau South Senatorial District is home constituency of many prominent politicians, including Governor Simon Lalong, Minister of Women Affairs and former deputy governor, Dame Pauline Tallen, former governor and senator, Jonah Jang, and former senator, Gen. Jerry Useni (rtd).
 
Lalong, while congratulating Dadu’ut on her victory after a keenly contested primary in Shendam, expressed optimism that the party would retain the senate seat. The governor, who is also Chairman of Northern States’ Governors Forum (NSGF), reminded other contestants that with the primary over, it is time to come together and rally round the candidate to ensure that APC retains the seat in the Red Chambers. Earlier before casting his ballot at the primary, Lalong expressed appreciation to party faithful for their peaceful disposition and transparent conduct, which he said is a display of democratic maturity.
