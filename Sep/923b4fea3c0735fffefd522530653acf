• Former NPFL top scorer dreams Eagles call up
Former Super Eagles defender, Bright Omokaro, has urged Gernot Rohr to give all, the strikers available for selection equal opportunity to stake their claims for the top hitman’s role. He said giving every eligible player chance to vie for the position would give Rohr the chance to choose the best for the Eagles. Omokaro specifically mentioned former Nigerian Professional Football League (NPFL) top striker, Anthony Okpotu, who recently won the top scorer’s award for his Tunisian club, US Monastir, as a player qualified to compete for the Eagles role. Omokaro said the ex Lobi Stars of Makurdi striker’s exploits in the Tunisian league has revealed that the depth of talent in Nigeria, adding that there are other players who deserve a look in having proved their worth in the NPFL and other leagues. “Winning the top scorer award in Tunisia and also being named the best foreign player in the league shows that Okpoku has come of age. I think he deserves Super Eagles’ call up. “Competition is vital in the national team. If he is allowed to fight for shirt with Victor Osimhen and others, it will bring out the best in the strikers and the winner takes it all. “When you watch Ronaldo and Messi in competition, you see they work hard to be at their best at all times. This is why our players in the national team need to be opened to competition to bring out the best.” Meanwhile, Okpotu has expressed happiness over his top scorer’s award, saying that achieving the feat was not easy due to the calibre of players in the Tunisian league. “It was not easy for me in Tunisia because most of the players in the league are in the Tunisian national team. “Because of this feat, I have received several offers from Africa, Asia and Europe, especially Germany. I am taking my time to make my next move. I am also open to Super Eagles invitation,” he said.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
