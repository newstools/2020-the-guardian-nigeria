The Chartered Institute of Taxation of Nigeria (CITN) has canvassed the knowledge, skills, and expertise of practitioners and other stakeholders for a successful tax practice.
 
The Institute noted that aside from the need for a technical grasp of taxation, which is its core competence as tax professionals; there was also the need to acquire other important skills germane to having a thriving practice.  As a professional Institute, CITN’s primary concern is on the need for professionalism and integrity in the conduct of tax practitioners. These are key to enhancing the level of respect that would be accorded the profession and the Institute,” she said.
