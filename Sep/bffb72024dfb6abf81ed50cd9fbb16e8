Petitions IGP over ‘harassment’ of party members
A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Zamfara State, Mr. Aminu Jaji, has alleged that illegal mining activities still go on in the state against laid down rules. Jaji, who was Chairman, House of Representatives Committee on Security and Intelligence in the 8th Assembly, told reporters in Abuja that “those who indulge in the illegal activities enjoy police protection.” He said the recent visit by Governor Bello Mattawale to President Muhammadu Buhari in the Presidential Villa to showcase gold samples from the state spoke volume of the illegal mining activities. “We are all aware that President Buhari banned all illegal mining activities in Zamfara and some other states due to insecurity in the areas. But I don’t know why in some places in Zamfara, illegal mining is still going on; some of the miners are even given protection by the police. “So we don’t know what is going on. To my greatest surprise, last month, the governor went to the President with some gold and other precious stones. Where does this man get them? I even blame those who secured audience for him with the President when they know that the President had banned all mining activities in Zamfara,” he said. The APC governorship aspirant in the 2019 poll called on the on the Inspector General of Police (IGP), Mohammed Adamu, to wade into the issue. “We are having by-election on October 31, and most of them are saying they don’t want the Commissioner of Police in the state to be removed or transferred to another place. This is because they believe that the CP is going to do a dirty job for them. “APC is the majority in Zamfara, but because we want to accommodate our people and have peace in our state, there had been intimidation and harassment of APC members by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) government,” he alleged.
