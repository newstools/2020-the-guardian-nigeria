Fayose had in a statement on Wednesday said that though Oyo State governor remains the leader of the party in the South-West being the only governor but should not abuse the position by meddling unduly in the internal affairs of the state chapters. He said: “Nobody is contesting leadership with Makinde. Ayo Fayose is not contesting leadership with anybody, including Makinde. But being the leader of the party doesn’t also mean he will be in control of PDP in all the state chapters.” But Olujimi, who spoke yesterday in Omuo-Ekiti in Ekiti East Local Council of the state while distributing empowerment materials to her constituents as part of the dividends of democracy, urged Makinde to ignore the alleged statement made by Fayose on the leadership of the Oyo State governor. Olujimi said that Makinde remains the indisputable leader of the South-West zone, who is free to visit Ekiti at will. She said: “I thank all of you for adopting Governor Seyi Makinde as the leader of the party in the South-West. That was what we did when Governor Ayodele Fayose was the sole governor in the zone. “Former Governor Fayose is a leader of the PDP and one of the many of the party leaders that we have in the South-West. He is not the only leader and former governor, there are many others. “So, Governor Makinde was adopted because he is a decent, understanding and knowledgeable person. The South-West National Assembly caucus had adopted him. I heard Fayose said the caretaker in the zone has not been allowed to function, why should he say that. Because he too had strangulated the caretaker committee we have in Ekiti State. “What has Makinde done? We will welcome him in Ekiti anytime. He should even come now so that we can celebrate him. Fayose’s comment was just an empty threat. “We say unequivocally that Governor Seyi Makinde is the leader of the zone. Why should party allow Fayose to conduct the congresses without following due process?” We will resist a man who contributed to the failure of our party in Ekiti and the zone. We are resolute to rescue the party.” Olujimi has, however, described as ill-timed the recent increase in the pump price of petrol by the Federal Government, urging Buhari to reverse the action in the interest of the masses. She said: “The timing was very wrong. Government must do things with human face. The timing was wrong and undesirable to the generality of the people.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
