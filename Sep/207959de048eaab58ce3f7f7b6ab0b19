Super Falcons Captain and Barcelona star, Asisat Oshoala, at the weekend unveiled a new logo for her girl-child foundation. The logo, designed by the sports giant, Nike, was inspired by the ex Liverpool striker’s goal of assisting the girl-child to attain her potential. Oshoala’s initials A, O, and football in one image designed on it. The Super Falcons’ forward said she decided to design the logo due to her outstanding love for girls to grow in soccer and also pursue their education without stress, adding that her foundation would soon extend the gesture to the African girl-child. “More things are coming up very soon for the African girl-child. We are unveiling new plans and strategies to make sure the African girl-child will have access to play football and go to school. “As the reigning African women footballer of the year, these are my duties I want to accomplish. We all need to put hands together to help the girl-child through education and sports,” Oshoala said. Oshoala, who is currently a NIKE ambassador, set up the foundation in 2015 to help the less privileged girl-child through education and sports.
