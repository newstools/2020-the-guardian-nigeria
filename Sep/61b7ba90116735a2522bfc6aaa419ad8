As part of an effort to support the project for the Protection of Child Victims of Violations known as (PAPEV), the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), has donated kits and sanitary materials to victims in Senegal. ECOWAS in partnership with the Regional Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and the Italian Agency for Development Cooperation has proceeded to deliver a large donation of kits and sanitary materials to the children whose their rights were violated. An envelope of 9,655000 CFA Francs was mobilized to acquire equipment consisting of hygiene and maintenance products (bleach, soap, hydroalcoholic gel), sleeping materials (mattresses, sheets, mosquito net, mats), and dignity kits (travel bags, toothbrush, clothes, etc.) for the children welcomed in the reception facilities. According to them, this support would make it possible to support the family reintegration of nearly 200 children as well as the care of hundreds of children received in protection structures. The PAPEV is an initiative of the Regional Office for West Africa of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), implemented with the support of ECOWAS, through its Centre operational in charge of Gender and financial support from the Italian Agency for Development Cooperation. This project is singularly distinguished by the adoption of a sub-regional harmonized and integrated approach around initiatives aimed at the exploitation and abuse of children, by bringing together at least six countries of the West African sub-region, namely, Guinea, The Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Senegal, Mali, and Niger.
