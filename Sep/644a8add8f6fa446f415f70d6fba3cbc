French sports daily L’Equipe reported the players could be Argentinian duo Angel Di Maria and Leandro Paredes, who spent their holidays together in Ibiza. PSG are set to start their Ligue 1 title defence at Lens on September 10. League rules stipulate team training sessions must be cancelled if a club has four positive tests, with match postponements possible. In recent weeks, several French top-flight clubs have reported positive tests, including Lyon, Marseille, Rennes, Nantes and Montpellier. Marseille’s game against Saint-Etienne on August 21, which was set to be the season opener, was postponed. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
