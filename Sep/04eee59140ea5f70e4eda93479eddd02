• Advocates say, ‘No food security without constitutional backing’ As prices of food items skyrocket due to production, storage, processing, and marketing challenges, lawmakers and policymakers have been called upon to make the right to food a human right in the constitution, without which there can be no food security and agribusiness development in Nigeria.  The fulcrum of the bill requires amending the constitution in Chapter 2 (Directive Principles of State Policy, wherein not justiciable), and also amending the Constitution in Chapter 4 (Fundamental Human rights, wherein justiciable). By moving the food security provision from chapter two to chapter four, citizens can better engage the government over failure to make food available and affordable by not providing requisites such as irrigation facilities, rural road networks, market, and other rural infrastructure, thereby influencing policy authorities to create an enabling environment and the productivity and security of the farm population (crop and livestock farmers alike); these being the responsibility of the government and connected to food production and availability in all parts of the country.
 
They propose that Mr President be mandated to produce and review on yearly basis an implementation strategy as a schedule to the bill, and to deliver an annual Food Situation Address to the National Assembly in accountability for the huge resources appropriated for the purpose, and in recognition of food security as the bedrock of national security.
 
The bill, it is argued, is geared towards the improvement of the policy environment for food security and agribusiness in terms of policy responsibility, accountability, transparency, and due process on the part of the government.  It is also argued that the bill would give a voice and a vote for the people in food security governance of the country, thereby ensuring their full participation in the policy process beyond their present token involvement.  An industrial biochemist and student-researcher at the University of Ibadan, Mrs Moji Karigidi, said such a development would help to hold the government responsible and create an enabling environment for food production, value addition, and employment opportunities. President, All Farmers’ Association of Nigeria (AFAN), Mr Ibrahim Kabir, however, said the association would state his position on the bill when it is presented for a public hearing or when called upon by relevant authorities to make inputs.
