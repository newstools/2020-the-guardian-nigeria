Musk’s increase in wealth was propelled by Tesla’s (TSLA) wild 12% stock gain that happened Monday after Tesla’s 5-1 stock split which now makes the Tesla founder and CEO of the third-richest person in the world. The world’s top five billionaires (in order) are; Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, and Bernard Arnault, the CEO of LVMH in France. Musk is also the founder of several other companies including SpaceX, The Boring Company, Hyperloop, and OpenAI.
Tesla’s stock has already soared about 500% in 2020, and the company is now worth about $475 billion. Musk’s pay package, which was approved by Tesla shareholders in 2018, doesn’t pay him any salary or cash bonuses. Instead, the CEO gets paid in millions of stock options, worth billions of dollars. He has received two multi-billion-dollar payouts as the company hit certain profit and stock price thresholds, and he is due to receive another soon. Musk owns more than 18% of the company’s shares, more than three times the next-largest stockholder. So as Tesla’s stock boomed, Musk’s net worth exploded by nearly $90 billion this year, catapulting him through the middle of the pack to the top three. In January 2020, Musk’s net worth was about $32 billion, with half of that wealth composed of Tesla shares, according to Forbes and Bloomberg estimates at the time.
