Havertz jetted to London, reportedly for his Chelsea medical, after being on the bench for Thursday’s 1-1 draw against Spain in Stuttgart. On Monday, Leverkusen head coach Peter Bosz confirmed they expected to lose the attacking midfielder. Leverkusen sports director Rudi Voeller said they are “grateful” to Loew that “Kai can now clarify things, with our support, on site in London”. After scoring 46 goals in 150 competitive games for Leverkusen, Havertz is set to join his Germany team-mate Timo Werner, who signed for Chelsea in June from Bundesliga side RB Leipzig for 53 million euros. If the transfer goes through, Havertz will eclipse Werner as Germany’s most expensive footballer. Loew said Havertz was “torn” between Germany duty and completing the transfer. “He absolutely wants to take this step,” added Loew, who acknowledged “the importance and scale of the move”.
