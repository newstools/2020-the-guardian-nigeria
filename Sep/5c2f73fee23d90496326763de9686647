No fewer than five persons have lost their lives to flood occasioned by torrential rainfalls in some communities in Warji Local Government area of Bauchi State. Governor Bala Mohammed, who made this known in one of the affected communities in Dagu village yesterday, said the government was seriously disturbed by the loss of lives and property to the disaster. About 300 households, 2,000 animals, and numerous farmlands were also affected by the flood. He warned residents of the affected communities to desist from erecting structures on waterways and drains to avoid being submerged by flood and consequent loss of lives. Mohammed said the government had provided emergency relief materials, including 100 bags each of maize and millet as well as clothing materials and mats.He added: “We would provide additional relief after proper assessment of the extent of damage.’’ He said his administration would soon begin the construction of spacious waterways and culverts in the affected communities to prevent the re-occurrence of the incident. Director-General of the state Environmental Protection Agency, (BASEPA), Mr Lurwanu Kabir, said the government had directed the agency to tour the 21 local government areas to assess the possible threats to the environments. “The tour will enable us to take proactive measures against such eventualities,” he said.
