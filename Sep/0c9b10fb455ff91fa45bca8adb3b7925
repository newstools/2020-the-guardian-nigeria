The Chairman, Code of Conduct Bureau (CCB), Mohammed Isah, yesterday said the level of compliance with the declaration of assets by public office holders in the country was not encouraging. Isah, who disclosed this at a two-day workshop on compliance with asset declaration and code of conduct organised for senior officers of the Defence Headquarters in Abuja, noted that the attitude is not unconnected with fear of unknown. He explained that it was more to the advantage of a public officer to declare his assets than to decline. According to Isah, the bureau strongly believes that when top public functionaries are well aware of and abide by the codes of conduct, the need for application of punitive measures would be minimised, if not eliminated, thereby reducing the resources expended on prosecution of cases. He said that the CCB had the mandate to establish and maintain a high standard of morality in the conduct of government business and to ensure highest standard of public morality and accountability. The Chief of Defence Staff, General Abayomi Gabriel Olonisakin, advised officers and men of the armed forces to comply with the constitutional provisions on assets declaration. According to him, as members of the armed forces, strict compliance with the provisions of the code of conduct is an opportunity to express a transparent stewardship in day-to-day activities. The CDS also stressed the need for every officer who holds a position of responsibility to be accountable. “You are also aware that accountability is one of the cornerstones in the fight against corruption which is one of Mr. President’s three-point agenda. “This seminar is important, especially for you senior officers, who, not only draw funds from government’s coffer, but are also responsible for the resources at your disposal.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
