Finland-based Coach, Victor Uzoho, has pointed at irregular appearances for club matches, non-exposure to international friendlies, and poor training as reasons Nigerian goalkeepers don’t produce their best forms in matches. The coach, who argued that Nigeria is blessed with good goalkeepers, said talent alone is not enough to make them as good as their counterparts in advanced countries. Speaking on a live radio programme from his base in Finland yesterday, Uzoho, who was recently appointed as a goalkeeper trainer for the Finnish Women Premier League side, Ticarona Palloseura FC, said good height, reflexes, ability to read a match, and communication skills, among others, are some of the qualities required of a sound goalkeeper. “The four goalkeepers that we have in the national team have been doing well. But one thing that is certain is that you judge a goalkeeper’s current form on his performance. This may be seen in how many games he is exposed to his club and country. When he is not doing this, he drops in form. Nigeria has so many good goalkeepers that should be encouraged to get to their best ability. “A good goalkeeper sees every aspect of the game on the field of play, he communicates effectively with the defenders for the defence to be well arranged. He definitely has to be in control of his area to ensure that no vacuum is seen. He must also show good agility, reflexes, and a good height to complement his reach,” he added.
