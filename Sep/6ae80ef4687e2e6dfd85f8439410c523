Yet, he delights in mischief – Babatunde Lawal. Once upon a time in a pristine African society, life was absurd at its best. Human life was largely devoid of meaning. Few succeeded with difficulties; the majority did not and didn’t know why. Many laboured but in vain. They gathered and watched things scattered for the cycle to begin again. The wise fail and fools prosper. The confusion (rudurudu) was far-reaching. Birds tweeted not like birds. Mouse squeaked in strange tones. Babies were not crying like humans. Dead trunks stood while saplings and trees in their prime fell. The villagers fasted and prayed to the gods. Rituals became a routine at road shrines and labyrinths. Almost everything they tried came to naught. Life was foul as almost everything polukumusu or withered without cause.
