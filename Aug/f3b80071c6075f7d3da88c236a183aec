The upgraded X-Whistle, accessible via, https://bit.ly/X-Whistle, boasts an improved user interface and easier navigation to enhance user experience. Some of the new features include a single repository for complaints, tips and referrals; and the ability to generate detailed and varied reports with analytics for proper tracking.
   
Speaking on the development, the Chief Executive Officer, NSE, Oscar N. Onyema, said: “This upgrade affirms our commitment to upholding market integrity, protecting investors and building a world-class capital market that is fully digitised.
 
“The X-Whistle has, therefore, been enhanced to ensure that all stakeholders are better able to sound the alarm on market violations in a quick, easy and seamless manner. We believe that the updates we have made to the X-Whistle will enhance market integrity and encourage accountability, while improving the experience of stakeholders in our market.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
