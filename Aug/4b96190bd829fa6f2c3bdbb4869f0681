Demand for undervalued high capital stocks, and anticipations of dividends payment by some quoted companies propelled five consecutive days of rally at the equities sector of the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), causing investors’ fortunes to rise, and the NSE All-share index and market capitalisation to appreciate by 1.41 per cent to close the week at 25,041.89 and N13.063 trillion, respectively. Similarly, all other indices finished higher with the exception of NSE Insurance Index, which depreciated by 0.28 per cent, while the NSE ASeM closed flat. Analysts at the weekend, expressed missed feelings on the sustainability of the bulls’ run due to inconsistent government policies, which have continued to dampen confidence.
According to them, this is likely to support volatility with the earnings reporting season gradually coming to end. For instance, the Chief Research Office of Investdata Consulting Limited, Ambrose Omordion, said: “The market again seems to have discounted the policy somersaults and lack of economic direction, as the government and its economic managers continue to wobble on policy formulations and statements that reveal a clear lack of coordination and vision among the different facets of policymaking. “One of the major drivers of inflation in the country today is the pump price of fuel, which in the last four months have been adjusted up and down before the latest price of N150 per litre of premium motor spirit, the highest in the history of Nigeria.” He continued: “It is painful that the current administration has failed to fix the nation’s oil refineries in Warri, Port-Harcourt, and Kaduna, which could have helped stabilise the price of fuel, rather than spending billions of scarce foreign exchange on importation of the prime product, resulting in imported inflation. “The removal of fuel subsidy according to the government was to stem the spate of high-level corruption and achieve single exchange rate and expansion of tax, but they are yet to give a direction and indicate where we are going as nation, due to the lack of focus and coordination to chart a new course in this economic reset.” He therefore advised investors to trade low priced stocks with serious caution to avoid being trapped. Also, analysts at Cordros capital, said: “Our view continues to favour cautious trading as risks remain on the horizon due to a combination of the increasing number of COVID-19 cases in Nigeria and weak economic conditions. Thus, we continue to advise investors to seek trading opportunities in only fundamentally justified stocks.” A review of the market performance last week revealed renewed bargain-hunting in most blue-chip stocks, especially Flour Mills and GlaxoSmithkline (GSK) Consumer Nigeria, the equities market commenced trading for the week on a positive note on Monday, as the All Share Index (ASI) appreciated by 0.29 per cent.
