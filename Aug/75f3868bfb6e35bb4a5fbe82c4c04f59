Since 2019 that the CoronaVirus (COVID-19) broke out from China, the world has learned many things about the pandemic. The disease has not changed, but scientific understanding is evolving dramatically. The first scientifically documented case of COVID-19 was from the United States in February 2020. It was after, that early warnings from U.S. Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that a very serious public health threat loomed. Then, health officials had only a rough idea of how the novel virus spread, who the disease affect most; and how best to combat transmission and provide treatment. Public messaging on the disease was at times conflicting and confusing, including the early advice declaring masks unnecessary. Now, scientists have a firm handle on how the virus spreads and what should be done to get the pandemic under control. Here are the nine things we know about COVID-19 now. The virus is also airborne. Early advice emphasized hand-washing, disinfecting surfaces, and sneezing into your elbow. It was then assumed the coronavirus spread mostly through handshakes, contact with infected surfaces and through close contact with infected people within six feet. Now, after months of scientific discussion and study, the experts agree: The virus can become airborne-within tiny, suspended droplets called aerosols. They can infect people beyond six feet, in poorly ventilated indoor spaces where the aerosols are trapped and build up. After six months of mounting evidence, the World Health Organization has agreed with scientists on this point. The risk outdoors is lower but not zero. What this means is that COVID-19 is still spreading, we can only avoid large crowds, observe physical distancing, wear masks inside and outside and continue vigilant hand-washing. Then, health officials held firm to the notion that the only recognizable symptoms of COVID-19 were fever, cough and shortness of breath. Now, the science of how to stop or slow the pandemic has been settled for months; it settled that every health expert now recommends face masks. Face masks are crucial to the control of the pandemic. Beyond masks, experts advise, prevent large indoor gatherings at non essential gatherings like bars; provide widespread testing with quicker results, paired with contact tracing, mandate physical distancing in public places; direct all these in coordinated fashion from the federal level. “We truly have great knowledge of how to control the virus,” says Yonatan Grad, assistant professor of immunology and infectious diseases at Chan School of Public Health, Harvard University.  Dozens of vaccines are in various stages of testing by different companies, research groups in many nations. Optimism was recently boosted when three separate groups- in China, at Oxford University UK and in the United States announced successful early trials, each generating an immune response to this novel virus and appearing to be safe. With each company able to ramp up production of its own vaccine separately, that would mean more total doses would be available sooner. For effectiveness, a vaccine needs to be just 50 percent effective to make it to the market. The other big question is when? Expecting a vaccine being delivered to the public by March 2021 isn’t out of the question.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
