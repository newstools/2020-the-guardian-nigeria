Members of the Golden Dames Club of Ikorodu has donated an acre of land at Oloye Estate, Eruwen, Ikorodu, to the community to erect a public secondary school. At the handover of deed of gift on the land, president of the club, Mrs Oluwagbemiga Temidayo Benson, said: “We observed that the closest secondary school is about 10km away. In line with our club’s objective of service to humanity, we decided to gift the land to build a school in the community.” She disclosed that a secondary school in the estate would reduce dangers children are exposed to while enduring travels from their homes to far distant locations.  “We enjoin all stakeholders to team up to ensure that the public secondary school is built,” she added. Similarly, chairman of Oloye Estate, Mr Adesegun Dosumu, said there was an infrastructural gap to fill, which required people of goodwill and exemplary generosity as demonstrated by members of the club. “We are eternally grateful. This is the first step the communities and stakeholders would strategise on how to erect the structure and we hope that the government will respond quickly,” he said. Chairman, Ikorodu North Local Council Development Area (LCDA), Adeola Adebisi Banjo, commended members of the club for the initiative and also announced that the street where the school is located would be changed to Golden Dames Avenue.
