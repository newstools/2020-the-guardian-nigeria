In its trademark tradition of celebrating Edo Indigenes, fast growing social media platform, @edopride, has inducted the first civilian governor of defunct Bendel State, the late Prof. Ambrose Alli, into the prestigious Hall Of Edo-Pride. According to the promoter of the Edo-Pride platform, Mr. Kazeem Bello-Osagie, “the late Prof. Ambrose Alli was a peacemaker, an Edo icon, highly revered by the Edo people, especially for the legacy he left behind in the educational sector, for the then Bendel State, where he served as a one time, civilian governor”. He added that the Hall of Edo Pride was introduced to say a big thank you to our heroes, both living and dead. Bello-Osagie said Nigerians at home and in Diaspora can connect with Edouard Pride on instagram through its handle @edopride while those on twitter can do likewise through the handle @edopride1. “The Hall of Edo-Pride is for Edo indigenes and residents of Edo State, regardless of their state of origin, who have excelled in their chosen fields, impacting the Edo people’s lives, building and leaving behind lasting legacies,” he said, adding that the prerequisites for selection for induction, will be strictly on merit for those who have lived a life of service. Bello-Osagie added that other categories introduced by the Edo-Pride since inception, which has been well received, included Star of the diaspora, Star banker of the month, and Stunner of the week.
