To cater for the well-being of entertainers, an online crowd-funding platform, quickraiz.com, has partnered with the Actors Guild of Nigeria (AGN) to raise N50 million for ailing veteran actors. Signed on July 24, 2020, the agreement targets the amount for the first period of three months. Launched in 2018, Quickraiz is an online fundraising platform that allows individuals and organisations to expand their target audience to raise funds for their medical, educational and other needs. Speaking on the partnership, the MD/CEO of Ativo Nigeria Limited, owners of Quickraiz, Bayo Adeokun, said the objective is to assist AGN members who can’t afford medical bills raise funds. Adeokun said: “In recent times, we have seen many old actors and actresses having health issues, which they are unable to finance their medical bills and with the advent of COVID-19, their conditions get worsened by the day. “As a passionate group which cares about the welfare of its members, the executives of the Actors Guild of Nigeria took it upon themselves to assist the ailing actors that couldn’t pay their medical bills by partnering with us as a professional crowd-funding platform in Nigeria to flag off a N50 million fund to cater for their members both home and abroad.” Some popular actors having serious challenges include Ify Onwuemene, Bruno Iwuoha, Ifeanyi Ezeokeke, Tunde Alabi and Tina Nwachukwu. The AGN representative, Emeka Rollas Ejezie, said the MoU with Quickraiz would help ease the stress of the association running round for funds to help ailing actors. He said: “The fund caters for our members who are currently on sickbed in different hospitals across the country.
