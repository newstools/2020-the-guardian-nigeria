Cardi B Fans Launch Petition To Remove Kylie Jenner From WAP Video Kylie Jenner’s sultry appearance in the new music video from rap queens Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion has not gone down well with some fans. A petition has been launched to remove the Keeping Up With the Kardashian star from the WAP video which has racked up more than 45,000 signatures from disgruntled viewers with the numbers rapidly rising. On the release of the eagerly anticipated WAP video yesterday, fans were shocked to see 23-year-old Kylie saunter into shot wearing a revealing leopard print bodysuit. “The video was perfect until we saw K and I wanted to throw my phone,” read the petition to remove the star. Another tweeted: I was happily enjoying my daily cup of brown women until that culture stealing colonizer showed up and made me spill. Thank you. Kylie was one of five surprise appearances in the eagerly-anticipated music video for Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion. Since the furore over the lip kit mogul’s cameo, Cardi has since taken to Twitter to respond to the backlash. While she didn’t mention Kylie directly, Cardi said it was the aim of the video to ‘include different woman from different races and backgrounds.’ She wrote: I wanna say thank you to every woman that was apart of my video! The fact that you made time in your schedules means alot to me! It was so important to me to include different women, that are different races and come from different backgrounds but are so powerful and influential. The WAP video also had appearances from Normani, Mulatto, Sukihana, and Rubi Rose. Kylie is yet to speak on the controversy but is clearly proud of her work, sharing several snaps from behind the scenes of the shoot.
