 Makinde  The state’s Commissioner for Information, Culture and Tourism, Dr. Wasiu Olatubosun, disclosed this after the weekly virtual State Executive Council meeting. He said that the gesture was in line with the policy of the present administration to cater for all without prejudice and to give the workforce reasons to be satisfied to boost proficiency. “Ninety-seven civil servants dismissed in 2012 were recalled the moment this administration got into the office. The executive council, today, approved their notational promotion and payment of gratuity to the concerned ones among them. “This is in furtherance of the present administration’s drive to give cause for the working population to be happy for the job they do. It is also a testament to the fact that this is a government with a large heart that caters to the welfare of all,” he said. Besides, Olatubosun said that the executive council had approved a contract for the completion of sections 1 and 2 of the 12.5 kilometres dualisation of Challenge-Odo-Ona Elewe-Apata Road in Ibadan. He said the contractor, Messrs Kopek Construction Nigeria Limited, had agreed to repair all defective portions on Section 1 of the road and to embark on the completion of Section 2. “In consideration of displacement of Oyo State residents in this particular area, Oyo State government has deliberately channelled Section 2 to pass the CBN route so as to reduce the number of residents displaced by the construction. “The road, when completed, will significantly reduce traffic along Challenge-Apata axis of Ibadan metropolis; and delivery period is 12 months,” he said.
