He observed that the affiliation would also advance the African Union Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance (ACDEG), African Union Agenda 2063, the United Nations Agenda 2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The DG submitted that the challenges facing the continent required innovative thinking. Among the problems, he mentioned the insurgency in the Sahel impacting parts of Nigeria and a number of other countries in the region; political tensions, often related to elections; disputes over trade and regional protocols and significant climate changes affecting the largely agrarian economies of the area.
 
Galadima admitted that the world was going through a period that tasks the creative energy, innovative spirit and imagination of institutions such as NIPSS.
 
The partnership, according to him,  “calls for our deepest instinct as Nigeria’s leading research and strategic human resource training centre to shine the path and serve as a beacon of hope not just for Nigeria alone, but also for Africa amid the despair and challenges of our present situation.”
 
Also present at the event were chairman of Dantiye Centre, Emeritus Prof. Munzali Jibril and his CGPSI counterpart, Dr. Jonathan Sandy, who was represented by Dr. Tony Karbo.
 
They both expressed confidence that the agreement would open a new frontier in collaborative problem-solving on the continent.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
