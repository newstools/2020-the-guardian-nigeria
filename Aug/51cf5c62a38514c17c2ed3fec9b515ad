 Jeremiah Okorodudu  Okorodudu, a member of Nigeria’s contingent to Los Angeles ’84 Olympic Games, told The Guardian yesterday that he was indeed grateful to the sports minister and his staff, as well as the ex-boxers for the support they rendered to him in his moment of difficulty. The former boxer, who rose to prominence as one of Nigeria’s most celebrated pugilists in the 1980s, said in a message to The Guardian through his wife, Mrs. Nike Okorodudu: “Thank you very much for all that you have done for me. May God reward you abundantly. The hospital bill has been taken care of. “Mary Onyali and some other officials in the sports ministry sent money to me. I also thank the ex boxers who sent money. We are really grateful,” she stated. The wife revealed that officials of the sports ministry had assured Okorodudu of payment of his contract salaries, which runs into several months. “They have assured him that they are working on it (the salaries). My appeal to the sports minister is to renew his contract when he fully recovers. It is an appeal,” she stated. It will be recalled that the former boxer survived a major operation in a Lagos hospital after battling with ailment for about two months.
