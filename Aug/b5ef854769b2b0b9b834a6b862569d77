New Special Adviser on Sports to President Muhammadu Buhari, Daniel Amokachi, has lamented the sorry state of Nigerian sports, saying the sector has been ‘so much underdeveloped’ in recent times. He also pledged to listen and work with such advice that would move the sports sector forward. Speaking on a radio programme yesterday monitored in Lagos, Amokachi said his role, as special adviser on sports to the president is to seek possible ways of revamping the sector. The ex Super Eagles star said it was unfortunate that sports, which in the past gave the country global reckoning through laurels won by Nigerians in different games, has not grown at par with other countries. Regretting that Nigeria lacked the requisite facilities to develop the numerous talents littered across the country, Amokachi said the challenge is now how to discover talents from the grassroots and give them internationally-recognised training that will make the best of their talents. He noted that his call to service as adviser on sports to the Federal Government would give him opportunity to proffer solutions and map out modalities that would take Nigerian sports back to where it belongs. He also explained that various aspects of sports development has to be examined to ensure the county gets a well-structured road map to improve the standard of different sporting activities. “We should realise that Nigerian Sports is dead.  We have to come together to revive it. I am open to discussions and advice from stakeholders in sports and other Nigerians. We have to move sports forward. Stakeholders have to put things in proper perspective and advise the government appropriately.” Expressing his gratitude to the Federal Government for his appointment, Amokachi said, “I am delighted that the president is ready to work with credible advice given to him.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
