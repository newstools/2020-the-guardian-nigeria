The National President, Association of Senior Staff of Banks, Insurance and other Financial Institutions (ASSBIFI), Oyinkan Olasanoye, has urged the government, to, as a matter of urgency, reconstitute the National Labour Advisory Council (NLAC), which has been moribund for over a decade. 
 
She said until the NLAC is reconstituted, the government and employers would continue to deny workers their right to participate in decisions affecting the interest of workers.  “We need more capacity building to equip us to organise, and negotiate in a complex environment, especially as presented under this COVID-19.
 
“Employers most especially those in the Organized Private Sector will seize this as an opportunity to pursue anti-union and unions busting agenda, such as provided in Section 45 of the amended Banks and other Financial Institutions (BOFI) Act 2004, where the President is empowered to proscribe any union in the banking sector whose activities he suspected to be against the economic interest of the nation,” she said.
 
She mentioned some on the challenges facing the trade unions movement in Nigeria to include poor enforcement of the labour laws, lack of political will to sufficiently review the obsolete labour laws, dearth of experienced and committed union leaders, government unilateral decisions on sensitive national issues affecting workers and lack of respect for Collective Bargaining Agreements (CBAs).
