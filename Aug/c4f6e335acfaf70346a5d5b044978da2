Ed Sheeran To Mark Baby’s Birth With A Special Tattoo Singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran is reportedly planning to mark his baby’s birth with a special tattoo tribute. The Shape of You singer is reportedly expecting his first child with his wife Cherry Seaborn. However, earlier this year, Ed revealed that he has a special plan in place for any children he has in future according to report by The Mirror. Known for his extensive tattoo collection, including his trademark tattoo sleeves, Ed is said to be planning on using his body ink to mark the birth of his kids. Ed Sheeran already has a circular design on his back that he will fill in with his children’s palms as they are born. According to the Daily Mail: Ed comes from a large Catholic family and he wants to have a house full of kids. He has had five intertwined circles put on his back that look a bit like the Olympic rings. He wants to put a tattoo of a palm print into each circle. It wouldn’t be the first time that Ed has marked special occasions and memories with a tattoo. He got a tattoo of the word “Red” after he joined friend Taylor Swift on the 2013 tour of her album of the same name, which proved transformative for Ed’s career. It has been reported that Cherry Seaborn is in the final stage of her pregnancy with Ed’s first child and they are over the moon. They’re very excited but have decided to keep things very low. British born Cherry, 28, met Ed Sheeran, 29, at Thomas Mills High School in Framlingham, Suffolk, where the singer is believed to have had a crush on his classmate. The pair finished their secondary education there and Cherry then attended Duke University, which is located in Durham, North Carolina, in America. In 2016, after months of dealing with a long-distance relationship with Ed, it was revealed that she had moved back to the UK from the US to be with him.
