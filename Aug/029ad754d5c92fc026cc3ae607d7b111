Catholic Bishops of the Owerri Ecclesiastical Province the other day called upon their fellow citizens to defend themselves against bandits in every guise in view of “serious doubts on the willingness and capability of Nigeria’s  security outfits  to rise up to their constitutional responsibility.”  In a communique issued on this score, the clerics urged people to, “Rise up in prayer to God in vigilance and in legitimate self-defence, for the rights to life, to our homes, to our lands that is God-given.”
 
Coming from such high quarters of the religious community in the land, this is worrisome. It is a damning indictment of primarily the Federal Government: that highly placed and influential Nigerians are speaking out in this manner at this time. But it is not difficult to understand the frustration that has propelled this sentiment. Simply put, the three tiers of constituted authority that are, by law, granted the powers and the resources to secure the lives, property and welfare of the citizens have shown themselves incapable of doing so. Indeed, it is the direct failure of the Federal Government, which controls the security forces to fulfill this primary obligation that the Bishops had to specifically call out the Imo, Abia, and other state governors to protect their people and their lands.  Besides useful suggestions from other well-meaning groups and persons, the Northeast governor are reported to have offered Buhari pieces of advice that include addressing the root cause of insurgency, empowering the police with “state of the art equipment and armoured personnel carriers … with a view to bridging the manpower gap observable in the Nigerian army.” They are the leaders on the frontline, they should know. But it must be said too that Buhari is a military general and must bring his knowledge, skill and experience to bear on the clear and present security threat to Nigeria on his watch. Nigerians are therefore waiting impatiently for a ‘‘change’’ to that ‘‘next level’’ of better security and welfare.
