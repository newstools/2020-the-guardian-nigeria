The Commissioner said information reaching him indicated that some schools had been collecting unauthorised fees, under “project fees”, among others, from students in exit classes. Daramola maintained that collection of such fees contravened the Executive Order 001 of October, 2018 signed by Governor Kayode Fayemi, warning that anyone caught collecting or reported to have collected money without returning it would face sanction. Similarly, Daramola has directed JSS3 Students in Christ’ School and Christ Girls School in Ado-Ekiti and some private schools that registered for the Basic Education Certificate Examination in the state to resume on August 17, 2020 in preparation for the examination, which commences August 24.
