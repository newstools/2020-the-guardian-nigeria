A court hearing for a US teenager accused of masterminding last month’s Twitter hack was interrupted Wednesday with rap music and porn. The hearing which was held via Zoom was to discuss reducing bail terms set for the 17-year-old Tampa resident arrested last Friday over the hack last month of the accounts of major US celebrities.

Judge Working From Home Appears Half-Naked During Live-Streamed Court Hearing Investigators view the youth — AFP has chosen not to release his name because he is a minor — as the brains behind the mid-July cyberattack that rocked Twitter. Hackers accessed dozens of Twitter accounts of people such as Barack Obama, Joe Biden and Elon Musk, after gaining access to the system with an attack that tricked a handful of employees into giving up their credentials. The hack affected at least 130 accounts, with tweets posted by the usurpers duping people into sending $100,000 in Bitcoin, supposedly in exchange for double the amount sent. Bail for the 17-year-old was set for $725,000 and in the hearing, his lawyers were seeking to reduce it. After the judge suspended the hearing, and eventually resumed it, hackers went at it again — with interruptions
that disguised their user names as organizations such as CNN and BBC. In the end, judge Nash ruled against reducing the youth’s bail. He was arrested along with two others, aged 19 and 22, one of whom lives in Britain, and was charged with cyber fraud.
