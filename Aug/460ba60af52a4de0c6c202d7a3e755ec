The National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW), in partnership with Humanity Nigeria, made up of young professional volunteers from diverse backgrounds, have strengthened ties to lead Nigeria to an environmental world record campaign with the highest number of plastic bottle wastes.
 
Achieving the world record and five million plastic bottle wastes removed in every part of Nigeria, the group said the motive was also to ensure a clean and safe environment.
 
Chairman, NURTW, Lagos State, Musiliu Akinsanya, stressed the need for everyone to rise up to the challenge towards ensuring a clean and safe environment.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
