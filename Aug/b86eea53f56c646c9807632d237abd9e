When you decide to wear florals, you have to keep one thing in mind – balance. Keep accessories at a minimum to keep the look polished rather than a flower bush. Chioma Ikokwu | Image: Fashion Style Nigeria Scale It To Flatter
The larger the prints, the greater surface area impression it gives while the smaller the print, the smaller the frame appears. Choose florals with flowers that are no larger than your hand span; think anything between 3-5 in per flower. Mercy Aigbe | Image: MPNB Stick To One Print
Mixing prints when a floral is involved should be left for only the adventurous and seasoned fashionistas. If you want to be bold, add an edgy piece like a leather jacket, to your floral, but don’t add another print that competes. Ebuka Obi Uchendu floral pattern suit Florals Are Not Seasonal
Just because you can’t grow flowers in your garden year-round, does not mean you can’t incorporate them in your wardrobe. Florals are a year-round print. The key is, like with any print, to choose the styles and colours that are season-appropriate.
