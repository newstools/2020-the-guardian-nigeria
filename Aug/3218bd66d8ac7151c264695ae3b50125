 Lagos. Photo/TRAVELSVENUE  The programme, an advocacy approach, would address more of truck/tanker driver education, basic training on road traffic rules, safety measures and precautions, the negative effect of overloading, and speed limitation during the ember months. In line with the directives of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State, the Service vowed to restore sanity to Lagos roads. Director, VIS, Akin-George Fashola, said the marching orders of the Governor would check unwholesome activities of trucks; tankers, trailers and rickety vehicles such as Danfo, buses, and others. Fashola also warned sellers of intoxicants such as drugs and liquor in truck/trailer parks in the state to desist from such acts, as the Service was determined to put an end to drug and alcohol-related road accidents. He warned the drivers to desist from patronizing the ‘paraga’ sellers, to prevent them from losing focus and enable them to concentrate while on the road. He explained that starting off the sensitization programme early is to create awareness, and put the drivers in the right frame of mind; which in effect would result in zero level traffic mishaps during the ember months. The Service, according to the Director, would emphasize drivers’ education, vehicle maintenance culture, safety measures, effects of fatigue/stress on drivers, and the need to be alert while driving. “This message would gradually cover all road users in the state before the December 2020/January 2021 festive period.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
