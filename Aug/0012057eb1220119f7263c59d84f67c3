“For the whole universe is interconnected.
If something is distorted, the other things connected with it suffer”
– Walda Heywat.
“A community without honour is not better than a gang of thieves”
– Yoruba maxim. Olori stared at Kabiyesi in utter surprise. She had seen the king half-naked more than a dozen times; none was in daylight, full glare view of the most revered king. She couldn’t tell how long she had stood drown in thoughts. The roar of “gba (take)!” from the naked Alaafin startled her. She took the bathing sponge from his outstretched hand and began to scrub his back in rhythmic vertical motion. Gentle friction of the new sponge created tingling sounds that filled the bathtub. Kabiyesi was enjoying the early evening shower. But the small back and the entire slim frame continued to gnaw Olori’s mind. It betrays the larger than life regal status known of his majesty when seated on the throne. “What a small construction”, she heard in her head. She was close to laughter now.  “why did you ask, Olori?” “I was just wondering why Olowo-orimi is most dreaded,” she dropped the clanger, “when you are not more than this (in size)!” His mouth fell like a curtain and could not close it.
