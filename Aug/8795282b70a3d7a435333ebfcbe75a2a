Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State has berated the All Progressives Congress (APC) for “continuously giving excuses for their failure to solve pressing national problems facing the country.” Wike said the APC had in 2015 promised Nigerians that it would solve most of the national challenges, but had, five years after, failed woefully to meet the expectation of the citizenry. The governor denounced the APC poor performance in governance when Rivers State executive of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) visited him at the Government House, Port Harcourt yesterday. He said Nigerians were hoping that the PDP would return to power because the APC had failed Nigeria. “You have promised and you have failed. There is nothing to try you for again. Nigerians have realised that it is better they stay with the PDP that has the interest of Nigeria at heart than a party that gives excuses everyday. “You know there are problems in Nigeria and you made promises, asking Nigerians to vote for you, and for five years, nothing has changed,” Wike lamented He advised Rivers people not to allow themselves to be hoodwinked by APC political appointees from Rivers State who have nothing to offer them. “There is nothing the APC can say to Rivers people today as the reason they should be voted for. Whether it is the Federal Government or their political appointees, they have nothing to tell us. “The money they have approved for us as refund has not been given to us. But I am not worried. I will continue to work. We have something we can show to Rivers people,” he said. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
