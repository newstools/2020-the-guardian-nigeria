A recent directive by the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) to landlords and property agents to charge 6% stamp duty on all tenancy and lease agreements has been criticised by many as grossly insensitive and irresponsible by many stakeholders including the Trade Union Congress and other labour groups. The FIRS directive articulated the various stamp duty types and their rates including appraisement or valuation of property (1.5%), certificate of occupancy, partnership (N1,000 flat rate), gift of land (1.5%), legal mortgage (0.375%), legal mortgage (up stamping) (0.375%) and deed of conveyance or transfer on sale of property (1.5%). Others include memorandum of understanding (related to land, sales, joint venture, surrender, subdivision agreements (1.5%), power of attorney (irrevocable/land related) (1.5%) and sales agreement (1.5%). 
 
Doubtless, bringing up these taxes at this time is really insensitive on the part of government. While the taxes listed above are impactful on the generality of Nigerians, the one with the most impact on the ordinary Nigerian is the 6% stamp duty on tenancy and lease agreements. From the directive, the burden of payment is on the impoverished beneficiary of the tenancy or lease agreement while the responsibility of collection and remittance falls on the landlord.  In fact, some daring and impoverished tenants are ready to slug it out with their landlords as regards the payment of rent.  What then would the situation be like when stamp duty charges are added to the normal rents? It’s a case of “adding salt to injury.” The times are really hard for the ordinary Nigerian and this government needs to come to terms with reality. Does the Federal Government want to reduce the population through killer taxation? Do they know the number of tenants who can’t renew rents all over the country at the moment? Government should note that an average worker or small business has to contend on a regular basis with choking multiple taxation on the households and the business sector. The government should fix the economy and make it productive.  A rentier state has no business taxing the citizens already reduced to abject poverty status. All told, government should unleash productivity and provide jobs before exploiting the tax routes.   To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
