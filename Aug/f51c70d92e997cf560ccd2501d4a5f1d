Getting the perfect type of denim pant or your body type goes a long way to determine how good you will look in a pair of jeans. In fact, the less fit it has on you, the less flattering they will be. Knowing your body type and the best denim cut to buy is a point you cannot overlook because if the truth be told, you must have noticed by now that some of the denim pants you own don’t do your body shape the proper justice as they should. With that in mind, we have put together the best type of jeans that would go well with your body type. Hourglass shape
If you have an hourglass shape, a classic boot cut denim pant is just the thing for you. It will keep you slim in all the right places but still show off your beautiful curves. Pear Shape
If you are pear-shaped (slim on the top and wide in the lower portion), keep a balance by going for a tapered cut pant, this will give your waist and hip a trim look and balance your figure out. Plus-sized
Make sure you go for dark-rinsed denim with a straight-cut leg (maybe a little form-fitting) or trouser cut pants. These types of cuts have a slimming effect on your body shape. Slim
When you are tall, you can absolutely rock a straight cut denim pant or go retro with a little flare in it. You have the height to carry it off. Petite
For petite girls, a slim-cut pair of denim, cute boot-cut, or sexy cropped skinnies would look terrific on your smaller frame. The rise of a pair of jeans is also very important when picking the right pair of jeans for you. If you want to show off your curvy hips, low-rise jeans are a great option. Just make sure they fit snugly at your hips to avoid the dreaded waist-gap problem. Athletic body types can also rock a mean low rise. Because you may not have the curve in your hips, the jeans may hang a little lower so make sure to choose a fitted style with stretch. Mid rise is the most figure friendly rise out there; comfortable for all body types, and a bit of a secret weapon for everyone who wants a little more structure around the midsection. Mid-rise jeans are also really compatible with just about any top length, which makes them a great go-to all around. High rise fit is often viewed as “retro” but the truth is, it’s a classic and thletic body types with smaller waists would love this fit. Hourglass shapes on the slender side look fantastic in high-rise jeans with stretch. This is a perfect style for cropped tops and tuck-ins.
