Nigeria’s golden girl, Georgia Oboh, has described her performance at her debut Ladies Scottish Open as sign of better days ahead, saying her drive and greens in regulation have greatly improved. Oboh shot a 73 one over par in the one-day 2020 Pro Tour event characterised by showers at the Willow Valley Golf club, Brighthouse, West Yorkshire in the United Kingdom (UK). The Pro Tour is designed for male and female budding professionals based in the North of England. It was Oboh’s third event on the Tour; in the first, her scores was 77 at the event at Worsley Park, Manchester, which held in July and the second event score was 76 at Moor Allerton in Leeds. Her current score of 73 at midweek saw the Nigerian teenage star in a top 20 finish in a tie for 18th position. Speaking on her performance, Oboh said, “I can see improvements in my game, especially my drive and my greens in regulation has greatly improved. I struggled a little bit with my putting even though my stats are looking okay, I know it could have been better. “This is no doubt a confidence boost for me just before my next event at the Czech Ladies Open next week,” she assured. Looking ahead to more competitions on the Ladies Tour, Oboh said, “I thank God for keeping me healthy as I return to full time golf on the Ladies European Tour after lockdown.” She is billed to join a world class Ladies European Tour field next week at the Czech Ladies Open in Beroun Golf club near Prague in the Czech Republic.
