Fayose, Oni Unite, Vow To Take Ekiti
The crisis rocking Ekiti State Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), yesterday, further deepened, as two factional State Working Committees (SWC) emerged from two parallel congresses, held in different locations in Ado Ekiti. While former Commissioner for Environment, Bisi Kolawole emerged as Chairman from group loyal to former Governors Ayodele Fayose and Segun Oni, a former member of the House of Representatives, Hon Kehinde Odebunmi was elected Chairman from the splinter body loyal to Senator Biodun Olujimi. Fayose and Olujimi had been embroiled in crisis, with the duo flexing muscles over the control of the state party’s structures. However, after several years of political rivalry, Fayose and Oni used the congress to reunite with understanding to work hard to ensure victory for PDP in the state 2022 governorship poll. Fayose warned party members against indiscipline and disloyalty common among politicians, saying: “PDP was robbed in 2018, but 2022 is another day. Let us continue to be loyal. You could all see. There is no crack in Ekiti PDP. I would have been surprised if Engr Segun Oni had not been here today.” Also speaking, Oni appealed to party members to eschew internal wrangling, promising he would work with Fayose and other like minds to get rid of APC. Oni, addressing the crowd, said he felt elated to return to PDP to realign with those he had worked with in the past and trusted, when it comes to party politics. Speaking at the parallel congress held at Lotus Hotel, Ado Ekiti, Odebunmi, who was backed by Olujimi, former Deputy Governor, Sikiru Lawal and others, said the task of repositioning Ekiti PDP has begun with his emergence. Odebunmi lambasted Fayose for trying to forcefully take over the party’s structures in flagrant violation of the existing statute and extant laws guiding PDP.
