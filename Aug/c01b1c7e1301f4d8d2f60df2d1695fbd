Bishop Stephen Mamza, Chairman, Christians Association Nigeria (CAN), Adamawa Chapter, has tested positive for COVID-19. Mamza, who is a member of Adamawa State COVID-19 Committee, confirmed the development in a statement on Sunday in Yola. The Bishop said that the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), had confirmed his positive status. He said: “Today (Sunday), the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), confirmed to me that I am COVID-19 positive and I have to go into total isolation. “One lesson that I want people to appreciate and understand is that everybody has to make himself available for testing if need be.” The Cleric noted that testing positive for the virus was not a death sentence,  urging people to pray for him and all who tested positive. He urged the general public to take COVID-19 protocols seriously in order to help stop the spread of the pandemic.
Mamza said in compliance with COVID-19 protocols he had gone into self-isolation and already started treatment.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
