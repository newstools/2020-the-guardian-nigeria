Shatta Wale and Jackie Ghanaian musician Shatta Wale has slammed a Metro TV presenter for negative comments about his feature with international music star Beyoncé. Shatta Wale who was one of the African artistes that Beyonce featured on her “Lion King” The Gift” album recently featured on the music video for the song, Already. A video that surfaced online sees the Metro TV presenter identified as Jackie discussing the collaboration between the Ghanaian dancehall act and the American singer with her co-host. In the video, Jackie is heard saying “but she (Beyonce) didn’t even choose well.” The video appears to have been recorded months back when the album was first released because the presenters also talked about Beyonce not being interested in featuring Shatta Wale in a video. In his reaction to the comments, Shatta Wale blasted the presenters as “fools” and blamed pride as the reason why Ghanaian media doesn’t go far. Shatta Wale and Beyonce Shatta Wale wrote: “See fools in Ghana, no wonder our media don’t go anywhere, always talking with so much pride of foolishness.” He added: “A woman like you can say sh*t about your own fellow woman, I blame your makeup foolish girl!! Illiterate”. Watch the video below for more.  Shortly after the release of The Lion King: The Gift album, Shatta Wale basked in the glory of his feature on the album. The dancehall artiste while speaking during an interview has compared his voice on the track, “Already” to that of multiple Grammy award-winning songstress, Celine Dion. According to him, his feature on the track has not only presented him with the opportunity for more international projects but he has also been receiving commendations about his voice. On having a silky voice like Celine Dion, Shatta Wale said: “A lot of producers around the world have contacted me with most saying that they like my voice. It was after that I listened to my voice well and I realized that I sound like Celine Dion.”
