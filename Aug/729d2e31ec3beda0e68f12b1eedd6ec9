 Lawrence Achudume  The blood of Jesus that was shed on the cross has seven significances. The blood is for the deliverance and healing of humanity. The entire salvation agenda was centered on the blood. Every spot where the blood was shed won a major victory for the man that believes. Spots where the blood of Jesus was shed:
  • The head – So your head can be blessed forever
  • The hand – so you can prosper, have economic power (Galatians 3:13-14)
  • His feet – Dominion over the devil (Luke 10:19; Hebrews 2:14-15)
  • His side was pierced – cleansed sin. If that problem has a name, it has a boss. He heals because He is God.
But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you. Romans 8: 11.
  We lost our power to say yes to good, Apostle Paul pointed a clear picture of this confusion.
  For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do. Romans 7:19.
  In Gethsemane, Jesus faced same battle, either to follow His will or God’s will, but unlike Adam and Eve, He surrendered to the will of the father and recovered our lost will power. And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt. Matthew 26:39
  • By His stripes He won our health (Isaiah 53:5).
  • The whipping with stripes – 39 stripes (39 groups of diseases in the world) Deuteronomy 25:3.
  • Crown of thorns – our honour, prosperity: 2 Corinthians 8:9, Genesis 3:17-19, Matthew 27:29. Humanity was cursed to poverty by Adam sweat on the forehead, the blood from His head canceled it. Luke 6:38, John 19:2.
  • His pierced hand – our dominion on touch:  Genesis 1:28. All authority was given to Adam and Eve. It was in their hands till they fell and humanity lost that dominion. Deuteronomy 28:8,12; Genesis 43:12, Genesis 3: 17-19.
  • His pierced feet – Our dominion over places we step or walk to: Deuteronomy 11:24, Genesis 3:14-15, Colossians 2:15. When His feet were nailed, He shed His blood to redeem us from slavery and satanic dominance. Hebrews 22:14-18, Luke 10:18-19, Joshua 24:25, Romans 16:20.
  • His pierced heart – won back our joy. John 19: 33-34. He became our broken heart to restore our joy. Luke 4:18. Zechariah 12:10; 13:1, Hebrews 12:14. He won our deliverance from inner hurts and iniquities by His bruises: He was wounded on the outside for our sins; had inner bruises to free us from iniquity and inner hurts (Isaiah 53:5).
  If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed. John 8:36 The blood and Passover
Pharaoh pronounced his own death
  And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to thyself, see my face no more; for in that day thou seest my face thou shalt die. And Moses said, Thou hast spoken well, I will see thy face again no more. Exodus 10:28 -29
  When people hardened their hearts against the word or are disobedient to the word – they might be used as an example of God’s wrath – Exodus 11:9.
