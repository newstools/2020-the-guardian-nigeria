The EP, which comprises six songs, is a product of two years of tweaking and experimentation across languages and forms. It is catalysed by rhythmic drum-heavy pattern of puritan Fuji music. The urban spirit is reflected in the team of collaborators that the music icon assembles including producer, Mystro, and singers, Teni and Toby Grey. Awade is the projectâ€™s first single.  Fuji the Sound EP will arrive on August 21.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
