• Considers strategies for affordability, transportation
The Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, has said a significant network of additional gas pipelines remains a priority for the government as it thinks of strategies to make gas available and affordable for power generation and transportation.
   
According to him, substituting traditional white products with gas will cushion the effects of deregulation, foster human capital development through new investments, and create enormous job opportunities for Nigerians.  He said the Department is focusing on four strategic areas to reposition the industry, which include cost control and management, strategic partnerships, vertical integration and diversification and portfolio rationalization, and operational resilience.
     
Delivering her keynote, the President, SPE, Shauna Noonan, said energy transition has been misunderstood in many parts of the world, saying that there is a young generation that believes that there is no future for oil and gas.  The Chairman, SPE, Joe Nwakwue, said the oil and gas industry is facing significant headwinds from a push for environmentally cleaner fuels to producing cheaper oil and gas products.
   
He said the challenging scenario presents great opportunities, saying that how the industry addresses the challenge is fundamental to its survival and sustainability. “At the core of SPE is our continuous emphasis on capacity development and this is reflected in the training and short courses being offered at this virtual summit,” he said.
