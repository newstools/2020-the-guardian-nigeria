Nasarawa State High Court sitting in Akwanga has voided the removal of the former Secretary to Nasarawa State Government, Mr. Ahmed Aliyu Tijani on the ground of human rights violation. The Nasarawa State House of Assembly had directed Governor Abdullahi Sule to relieve the erstwhile SSG of his appointment for allegedly not able to account for N284.5m school projects fund, when he was the state Commissioner of Education. The governor complied with the directive, and appointed Aliyu Mohammed Ubandoma as the new SSG. Justice Mustapha Ramat voided the recommendation by the Assembly, as the action of the state assembly was illegal. This was even as the court also voided the recommendation by the State Assembly that the former SSG should refund over N200m. Justice Ramat, who based his judgment on fair hearing, ruled that Ahmed Aliyu Tijani was not given fair hearing by members of the Nasarawa State House Assembly, hence violating his fundamental human rights, when it decided on the allegations against the former SSG. Reacting to the judgment, counsel to the plaintiff, Shikamma Kassam Sheltu, said the most important thing was that the court has voided SSG’s removal, as well as the payment of over N200m into the state government’s coffers.
