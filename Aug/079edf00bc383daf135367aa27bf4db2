Swiss Town Covered In Chocolate After Malfunction At Lindt Factory A Swiss town was left covered in fragments of chocolate after a malfunction at a Lindt factory according to a report by The Daily Mail. Residents were taken aback when it started snowing particles of fine cocoa powder after the ventilation system at a chocolate factory malfunctioned. The nibs which are fragments of crushed cocoa beans make up the basis of chocolate. Combined with strong winds on Friday morning, the powder spread around the immediate vicinity of the factory, leaving a fine cocoa dusting. The Lindt & Sprungli company later confirmed that there was a minor defect in the cooling ventilation for a line for roasted ‘cocoa nibs’ in its factory in Olten, between Zurich and Basel. The company says one car was lightly coated, and that it has offered to pay for any cleaning needed, but hasn’t yet been taken up on the offer. Factory production was able to continue as normal and the company says the particles were completely harmless to people or the environment. However, things are back to normal as the faulty cooling ventilation has been fixed. Lindt and Sprungli, more commonly known simply as Lindt, is a Swiss chocolatier and confectionery company founded in 1845 and known for its chocolate truffles and chocolate bars, among other sweets. Lindt has opened over 410 chocolate cafés and shops all over the world. The cafés’ menu mostly focuses on chocolate and desserts. Lindt chocolate cafés also sell handmade chocolates, macaroons, cakes, and ice cream.
