The 62-year-old actress took to her Instagram page to share her sister’s hospital room; a solitary room with a large yellow tube being fed into it. According to Stone, her sister Kelly who already had lupus, an autoimmune disease that causes inflammation to the joints, skins and other organs, was now suffering from coronavirus. This she blames on non-mask wearers. “My sister Kelly, who already has lupus, now has COVID-19. This is her hospital room. One of you Non-Mask wearers did this. She does not have an immune system. The only place she went was the pharmacy,” she said in the Instagram post. “There is no testing in her county unless you are symptomatic, & then it’s 5 day wait for results. Can YOU FACE THIS ROOM ALONE? Wear a mask! For yourself and others. Please” Kelly also took to her own Instagram page to share a video from her hospital bed, lying in the dark, ‘begging’ her followers ‘to know that this is real’. “I am gasping… for every breath! Please do this for the people that you love: stand behind more tests, more masks. Demand everyone wear masks. You never, ever want to feel like this. I promise you!” She said in the clip, uploaded in the early hours of Sunday morning. Becoming tearful she added: “I only have love. My heart is breaking for people who can’t breathe!” Two days before her hospital admission, Kelly shared a snap of herself with her husband, captioning it: “This is us. March 13. Drove to our paradise in Montana. We thought covid wouldn’t and couldn’t find us. No shopping, no parties, barely saw a human. Now fighting for a breath. You don’t want covid.”
