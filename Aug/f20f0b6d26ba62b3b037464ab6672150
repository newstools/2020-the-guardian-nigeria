 Students writing WAEC Exam<br />  The state’s Commissioner for Education, Dr. Aliyu Tilde, in a statement, said a whistleblower has called attention of the ministry to the irregularities. According to him, “some of the irregularities include substituting the name of students who passed mock examination with the names of ineligible students that failed it.” Tilde said the list that was released by WAEC contained candidates who were not bonafide students of the schools they claimed. “This padding will not be tolerated,” he said. The Commissioner informed school principals that only two categories of students would be allowed to sit for WAEC in the state. He  said: “Those  who passed the mock test and their names have appeared in the list sent to the school by the ministry and bonafide students of a school who failed the mock test but have paid for WAEC registration through their school.” He urged principals to compile list of students affected by the irregularities, especially those who passed the mock exams but their names did not appear on the regional Exam body’s list. Tilde aasured that the ministry would carry out comprehensive audit of SSCE candidates who sat for the two examinations in every school after each examination is over. “Whoever is found to have committed any infraction will have himself to blame,” he said.
