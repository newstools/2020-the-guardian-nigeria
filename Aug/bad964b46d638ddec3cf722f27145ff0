With gold trading at over $1,946 per ounce and still rising, it’s a good time for Nigeria to pursue wealth creation and diversify its economy by creatively exploiting its natural and human resources.
 
Gold prices have not only rebounded in the international market amid global recession that has made investors wary of currencies, but also have for decades defied predictions of free fall like oil and other commodity prices.
 
But a gold processing centre that would end the export of raw gold out of the country is yet to debut to fully harness the potential in this high-risk, high-rewarding industry.  The Guardian gathered that another firm is billed to start production in Osun State next year, creating 400 direct and 1,000 indirect jobs in the process.
 
The prospects in the gold industry and how it could further be developed to great benefit to the country, raises questions on the absence of a refinery.  “Where is the money for the government to invest in gold refineries when there are other issues? Let the private sector be encouraged to look at it. If we have one or two success stories, I assure you Nigerians are fantastic at looking at good opportunities; they just need to see one or two people succeed, and before you know it, they will go into it.”
 
Okunlola expressed optimism that if the government could support and encourage the private sector, such ventures would boost the economy and place Nigeria on the path of development.  The General Secretary, NMGS, Dr. Akinade Olatunji, added that there are several globally acceptable gold refining techniques and the process is open to global scrutiny.
 
“There are also global certifications usually assigned to gold refineries. These certifications are only given after stringent vetting by the certification bodies. These are international bodies, which do not compromise on the specified standards. For Nigeria gold refinery to be acceptable globally, it must meet all the rigour of global certifications.
 
“Success begets more success. If the current refineries being promoted become successful, more will follow. All the government needs do is to ensure that the policies put in place are sustained and pursued to a conclusive end.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
