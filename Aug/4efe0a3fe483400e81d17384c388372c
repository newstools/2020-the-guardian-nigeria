Although the Senate last month, expressed its readiness to work with the executive arm in reviving the Ajaokuta Steel Company (ASC) project, the Federal Government has said that global travel restriction occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic, was preventing the technical experts from Russia from coming over to conduct an audit of the steel plant.
  
The Minister of Mines and Steel Development, Olamilekan Adegbite, while taking stock of activities in the last one year, however noted that the technical audit of the plant would be done as soon as the flight restriction was over.He said: “I am hopeful that Ajaokuta will come on stream before the end of President Buhari’s tenure, and when that happens it is poised to create thousands of jobs.”
  
Recall that Senate Leader, Yahaya Abdullahi, had led the Senate team on an oversight visit to Ajaokuta Steel Mill, and the Itakpe National Iron Ore Mining Company (NIOMCO), after the President rejected a bill passed by the Senate seeking $1billionn from the Excess Crude Account to fund the completion of the Complex.  Furthermore, the Minister projected that a slew of industries would spring up across the gold value chain. “Numerous industries will spring off when our gold economy becomes full-fledged. Some of them would include equipment leasing and repairs, logistics and transport as gold requires a specialized means of transport, security, insurance, aggregators, and so on. These would ultimately create tens of thousands of jobs. Indeed, the government of President Buhari is all about job creation.”
   
Adegbite also said that Nigeria, for the first time, had mined, processed and refined gold under the Presidential Artisanal Gold Mining Development Initiative (PAGMI), for use as part of Nigeria’s external reserves, adding that the first batch of the artisanal-mined gold bars, to be purchased by the Central Bank, was unveiled at a presentation ceremony to President Buhari on July 16, 2020.
  
“PAGMI will result in the creation of thousands of new mining and formalized jobs, leading to poverty alleviation for many households. Under the scheme, artisanal and small-scale gold miners will earn more from higher productivity, better recovery rates through mechanization of operations, and better access to reliable geological information,” he said.
 
Furthermore, Adegbite disclosed that the Ministry had initiated a process that would lead to local capacity development in the production of barite, and had employed a consultant saddled to develop a roadmap for the sector.
