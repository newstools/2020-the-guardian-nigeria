As the country braces up for hard times due to adverse effects of the pandemic on the economy, some 60 persons have emerged millionaires in the ongoing Dangote Cement Bag of Goodies Promo Season 2. This was disclosed at the weekend by the companyâ€™s Director of Marketing, Mrs Funmi Sanni, who said the promo was deliberately designed to serve as cushion against the negative effects and impact of COVID-19 on businesses and families, adding that more winners would emerge in the coming weeks. She said of the 60 winners, 35 have been presented with their symbolic cheques during which their accounts were credited with a million naira each at the presentation ceremonies held in several cities across the nation, while the remaining ones are to receive the prizes this week. According to her, no palliative could be better than the prize money won by customers during this pandemic. Sanni, who was speaking at one of the prize presentation ceremonies in Kano, said the promotion was to encourage the customers to continue patronising the product, which according to her, is the best in the country. She said the company had been making efforts to satisfy its customers, and that apart from the premium quality of the product, the firm had also introduced several customer-driven promotional offers to keep their relationship intact. She explained that a customer could only win the N1 million cash prize on collection of the scratch cards that each carries letter D, A, N, G, O, T and E to make up the name DANGOTE. Other prizes to be won in the promotion ending November 5 include motorbikes, tricycles, TV sets, and recharge cards. Chief Commercial Officer, Dangote Group, Mr Rabiu Umar, said Dangote Cement would award a total of N1 billion to 1,000 to winners across the country.
