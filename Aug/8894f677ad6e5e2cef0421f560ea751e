According to BSA, to capitalize on the economic and cybersecurity benefits of 5G, governments, should among others, harness software innovation; secure the 5G ecosystem; harden the cloud; manage supply chain risk, and build smart, effective 5G governance.  The body noted that effective supply chain risk management practices limit vulnerabilities and make it easier to protect networks.
    
It added that governments should adopt risk management approaches to supply chain security, advance policy interoperability, ensure transparent and fair supply chain policies, promote government-industry collaboration to strengthen security, and drive innovation and competition across the supply chain.
  
The software body explained that strong security controls and technical measures rely on effective 5G governance. But to establish mechanisms for responsible governance of 5G networks and supporting technologies, it noted that governments should adopt open standards with built-in security, cultivate trustworthy open-source cloud architectures, and establish flexible and coordinated governance mechanisms.
  
BSA is optimistic that by implementing these recommendations, policymakers can harness the security advantages of 5G technologies while addressing emerging security challenges. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
