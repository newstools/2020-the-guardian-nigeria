Former Nigerian boxer and member of the country’s contingent to Los Angeles ’84 Olympic Games, Jeremiah Okorodudu, was ‘hurriedly’ discharged from the hospital yesterday amid complaints of shortage of funds. Okorodudu has been battling for survival after undergoing a major operation in a Lagos hospital. The Guardian learnt that the former boxer, who rose to prominence as one of Nigeria’s most celebrated pugilists in the 1980s, was yet to recover fully before he was allegedly discharged from the private hospital where he was admitted in Ikorodu, Lagos, due to his inability to meet the increasing medical bills.	 Okorodudu had a major operation on Monday evening after more than two months of battling with the ailment. A member of his family confirmed in a chat with The Guardian yesterday that Okorodudu was discharged from the hospital even though the boxer still required more days to continue with his medical treatment. “He has to leave the hospital this morning (yesterday) because the bill is increasing. As we speak, Okorodudu is home, but he is in severe pains. He needs to continue with his treatment but there is nothing we can do. “We have spent all our money. Some ex-boxers actually spent a little money as part of the deposit before the operation was done on Monday. Okorodudu is still in a dangerous condition now, and he needs to go back to the hospital to continue with his treatment. We are appealing to every well meaning Nigerians to come to his rescue,” the family member pleaded. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
