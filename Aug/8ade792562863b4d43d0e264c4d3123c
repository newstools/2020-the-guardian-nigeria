To enhance the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) market development initiative, the Nigerian Capital Market Institute (NCMI), has unveiled plans to deepen stakeholders’ education.
   
The Managing Director, Ismaila Ville, while speaking after the successful accreditation of the Institute in Abuja, said the NCMI is the educational and training arm of the markets regulator, the SEC.
   
Ville, who said the accreditation would be beneficial to the Institute and to the capital market community at large, also said it had previously been identified by the Chartered Institute for Securities & Investment  (CISI), as an accredited training (ATP) provider of global certification to operators in Nigeria.
