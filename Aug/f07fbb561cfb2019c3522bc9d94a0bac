President Muhammadu Buhari has rejoiced with Nigerian born Kaycee Madu, appointed Minister of Justice and Solicitor General for the Government of Alberta, in Canada. Madu makes history as the first African born provincial Minister in Canadian history and is also the Provincial Secretary and Keeper of the Great Seal of the Province of Alberta. President Buhari in a statement signed by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, Thursday, described the honour as “landmark and historic,” saying it once again pedestals people of Nigerian descent as go-getters, who distinguish themselves in different walks of life. The President said as the first Black Justice Minister and Solicitor-General in Canada, Madu has written himself into history books, and urged Nigerians, both at home and abroad, to remain good ambassadors of their country.
