 It’s all about the “Hot Girl Summer” as rappers Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion have unveiled the music video to Cardi’s latest song “WAP.” The Grammy award-winning Cardi B teamed up with rap’s current It girl Megan Thee Stallion for this new song that is already trending on social media. The song is Cardi B’s first as a lead artist since 2019’s “Press” and Megan’s first musical outing since her altercation with recently deported rapper Tory Lanez where she was shot multiple times. The multi-coloured music video sees the rap divas exploring a whimsical mansion and has appearances from beauty entrepreneur Kylie Jenner and singer Normani. Before the video dropped, Megan and Cardi hosted a joint, virtual pregame where both seemed to be truly excited for the release of the video. Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion “WAP” is a twerk-ready song and prior to its release, Cardi B warned that the music video is a censored version of the song. She said: “I just want to let y’all know, I wanna give y’all the heads up, the music video is going to be the censored version of the song, because the song is so nasty that YouTube was like, ‘Hold on, wait a minute, someone might be too Goddamn nasty,” She encouraged fans to listen to the full “nasty” version on streaming services.
