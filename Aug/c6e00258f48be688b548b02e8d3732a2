The family said the well had been used for years but after it dried out, they decided to fill it in so it was not dangerous and that their son had been tasked with the job. Firemen said that when they arrived, they realised he was stuck tight and needed to tie a rope around him as well as a rescue belt in order to pull him free. The man, who sat calmly wedged in the hole with his arms folded, was then lifted free with no obvious injuries apart from some abrasions on his skin.
