The Iyaloja General, Folashade Tinubu-Ojo, has called on the Lagos State government to review the trading-hour regulation imposed on markets as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Speaking when she visited the Ikosi Isheri Fruit Market being reconstructed by the Ikosi-Isheri Local Council Development Area, Tinubu-Ojo said one of the measures put in place by the state to contain the spread of the pandemic was the restriction of trading hours to limit the influx of customers to the market. This, she said, no doubt had an effect on the volume of sales, thereby affecting the income of the traders. She therefore demanded that if alternate days are maintained, traders should be allowed to operate fully per day from 9:00a.m. to 6:00p.m. instead of closing at 3:00p.m. She appealed to the government to consider full operation of the markets just as the restraints on religious activities have been relaxed. On the market remodeling, she said few months back, the market was demolished and the authority explained that it was in line with the pursuit of the smart city agenda of the state government.
She noted that though the traders initially kicked against the decision, an agreement was reached with the management to the effect that their interests would be protected, coupled with the benefit of the remodeling of the environment. The market developer and Managing Director, Total Value Integrated Limited, Chris Onyekachi, said concerted efforts were being taken to ensure the project is delivered timely.
