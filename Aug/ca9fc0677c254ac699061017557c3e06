The 2020/21 English football season will get underway this weekend with the Community Shield battle between Liverpool and Arsenal heralding many big games across Europe. League champions, Liverpool, will take on FA Cup winners, Arsenal, in the 2020 FA Community Shield. Nigerians can watch it live on StarTimes’ World Football Channel on Saturday at 4:30 p.m. The match is expected to serve as a test event to welcome a restricted number of supporters into Wembley as part of plans for supporters to make a socially distanced return to sports venues more widely from October 1. The increased safety measures from the British government in late July may mean fans will not be able to attend.
Arsenal have won seven of the nine times they stood in the final since 1998, while Liverpool – who have made less frequent trips to the final in recent times – won nine of 12 finals since 1982.   However, three of those wins were shared as the FA only introduced extra time and penalties after 1991. The match will be immediately followed by an international break from September 2 to 10 with Germany facing Spain, Sweden against France and titleholder Portugal versus Croatia, among others, in the Euro Nations League, which will also air on StarTimes. And then La Liga Santander starts September 12. “Football has been at the core of StarTimes’ sports content strategy and this rich offering highlights our commitment to providing the best football experience to our users at the most affordable rate in the market.
