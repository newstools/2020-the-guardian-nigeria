Edo State Government has flayed rumour of purported clash between Governor Godwin Obaseki and his deputy, Rt. Hon. Comrade Philip Shaibu. In a statement, the Special Adviser to the Governor on Media and Communication Strategy, Mr. Crusoe Osagie said the falsehood could only have emanated from members of the All Progressives Congress (APC), who have no substance in their campaign and are only adept at spinning the rumour mill and concocting alternative facts to massage the egos of their paymasters, who cannot run an issue-based campaign, but rely primarily on tale-telling and propaganda. 
 
He said: “The lie that there was a clash between the governor and his deputy should be dismissed in its entirety. Whatever incident they allude to, only exists in the imagination of the purveyors.
 
“There was, indeed, a meeting with key stakeholders of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), which ended with everyone in high spirit. There was a spirit of cordiality and everyone shared their ideas and inputs on how to deliver the party in the September 19 governorship election.”Osagie advised the public to disregard the falsehood and any other such tales in the days ahead, as the election draws near.
  
He urged Edo people to ensure they are not kept away from government, by voting en-masse for Obaseki and his Deputy, Shaibu, in the September 19 governorship election. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
