Enugu Rangers’ General Manager, Davidson Owumi, has revealed that the Flying Antelopes are ready to battle for the top honours when the 2020/21 season kicks off next month. Rangers, who won the title for the first time in 30 years in the 2016 season, according to Owumi, have acquired every material necessary for the task ahead. In interview published by Rangers Media, Owumi said the club would retain majority of players that featured for the club last season, adding, “I am glad with the way we are going about our preparations for the fast-approaching football season. “Our coaching crew is at work and will soon come up with a list of players retained and those that will bid us bye for the season. For management, it is our belief that only a handful of quality legs will be sourced to fill noticed lapses in the team.” Owumi revealed that the coaches, led by former Super Eagles Assistant Coach, Salisu Yusuf, would soon release the list of players selected to fight Rangers’ battles the coming season, adding that the target is to beat the fourth position they got when the 2019/20 season was abruptly halted. Recall that Rangers ended the regular season on fourth position with 37 points from 24 matches but they were pushed down a spot lower by the Point Per Game system used to select teams to represent the country in next season’ continental club competitions.
