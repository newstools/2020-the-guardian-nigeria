About 10, 000 Small and Medium scale Enterprises (SMEs) are to benefit from a new MTN initiative to ameliorate the pangs of the coronavirus pandemic on businesses and the economy.
   
Tagged, The Revv Programme, MTN said the initiative is in line with the Federal Government’s digital economy drive, as espoused in the National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy (NDEPS), which is closely linked to empowering SMEs as an avenue for economic diversification.
   
The telecommunications firm said the programme, among others, seeks to address major macro level issues specifically in the areas of re-igniting the economy and driving digital inclusion for SMEs.  Also commenting, the Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment Otunba Adeniyi Adebayo, drew a nexus between his Ministry’s efforts in developing the MSME space and MTN’s The Revv Programme. This aims to “focus mainly on MSMEs and address the foundational digital needs as well as other skills such businesses need to develop; these include access to information, infrastructure, funding and new markets.”
   
Moolman, while thanking the ministers for their support, said the initiative seeks to provide support to SMEs as they continue to lead Nigeria’s growth.
   
“We believe that at this time when many businesses are at their most vulnerable and with a rapidly changing business environment, it is important that alongside the Federal Government, other businesses strongly position themselves to support SMEs as a foundation to the growth of  a stronger economy going into 2021 and beyond. “MTN has always spearheaded programmes to uplift small and medium businesses in Nigeria. The Revv Programme is our way of standing with SMEs in their journey to rise through these challenging times. We are positive this will assist them with the digital skill sets necessary to continue to thrive,” Moolman said.
