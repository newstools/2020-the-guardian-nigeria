The Edo All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship candidate, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu has pledged to repair Governor Godwin Obaseki’s damaged relations with the state royal fathers.
 
He also promised to partner with Edo traditional rulers to secure the lives of Edo people, particularly in the rural areas.
 
“We are going to repair the relationship between the state government and the traditional rulers, as well as other community-based leadership, closest to the people,” he stated. While condemning Obaseki’s poor relations with Edo royal fathers, Ize-Iyamu hailed their rural vigilante efforts, pledging to enter into partnership with them to secure the people, as soon as he took power. “The disdain and neglect the present administration has shown the traditional institution in the state is ill-advised.  They should be supported and partnered with,” he said.
 
He stressed that there was a link between partnering with Edo traditional rulers and boosting rural security, particularly to gather intelligence and prevent crime. In the post-September 19 Edo government to come, Ize-Iyamu said security was a serious goal, for which he would lead every segment of the state to work for, and in unity achieve.
