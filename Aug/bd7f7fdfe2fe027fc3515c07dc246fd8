• Urges Prayers For National Security
Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, yesterday, granted prerogative of mercy to 43 inmates of Kano Correctional Service in the spirit of Eid-Kabir Sallah celebration. Ganduje made similar benevolence gesture to 295 inmates in the month of May to commemorate Eid el-fitir Sallah festival while urging the ex-convicts to exhibit positive character and good virtues. In his Sallah message signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Abba Anwar, Ganduje charged the inmates and the entire Muslims to be law abiding and sustain prayers for security, peace and growth of the nation. He also advised residents to observe all health protocols against COVID-19 pandemic. “When we release people, we release them without taking into consideration their religious background, ethnicity, age or sex differences. We believe humanity as a whole should always be assisted. “Those on release are advised to be and remain people with sound character. Mrs. Jennifer Okafor is an example of those released from this and similar correctional centres. She is now holding on tight to her new job with the State Traffic Agency, KAROTA. This shows that we are achieving something. “It is extremely important for people to pray much harder for national development and the security of our state and the country in general. We must continue observing all the protocols as enunciated by health workers. This way, we can overcome the pandemic,” he said. Comptroller of Kano Correctional Centres, Magaji Ahmed Abdullahi,commended the governor for the gesture. Those released were given N5, 000 each as transport fare to their various destinations.
