• Buhari tasked on credible exercise
• Muslim group denies endorsing any candidate as Oshiomhole’s ex-aide backs gov The All Progressives Congress (APC) has charged its rival Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to canvass for votes based on issues and shun threats, as the September 19,2020 gubernatorial election in Edo State draws nearer. It claimed that the camp of Governor Godwin Obaseki was panicking “following the massive and widespread support given by the Edo electorate to the APC governorship candidate, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu.” In a statement by its Deputy National Publicity Secretary, Yekini Nabena, the ruling party at the federal level alleged that the Edo chief executive was working with his Rivers counterpart and head of the party’s campaign council, Nyesom Wike to “threaten violence, spin puerile conspiracies on the role of ‘federal might’ while using his so-called ‘Obaseki Boys’ and state apparatus under his control to harass the House of Assembly and APC members in the state.” APC assured the people that President Muhammadu Buhari would not the military to influence the outcome of the forthcoming poll. In the meantime, the Obaseki Field Marshal Campaign Group (OFM) has cautioned the Nigerian leader against militarising the contest, just as it appealed to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and relevant security agencies to ensure the election is free and fair. During a media briefing in Lagos, its convener, Don Olusegun Ugbo, said the occasion provides the President another opportunity to act his avowed impartial posture. Pledging their full support for the governor on account of his “sterling performance”, the group implored the players and stakeholders to allow Edo people make their choice for the continued development of the state. However, the Edo State Council of Islamic Affairs (EDSCIA), yesterday, denied endorsing any of the contestants. Addressing reporters in Benin City, its chairman, Abdulazeez Nosakhare Igbinidu, maintained that the body was apolitical. “We condemned in its entirety the purported endorsement of a particular politician using EDSCIA or any other name, as they do not have such right to speak on behalf of Edo Muslims. “EDSCIA, headed by Alhaji Igbinidu, is the only body that has the power to speak on behalf of the Muslim community in Edo State,” he clarified. Also yesterday, a former aide of Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, Andrew Momodu, made a N5 million pledge to Obaseki campaign. He announced the donation on behalf of Anwan Progressives Union (APU) at Ward 8 in Anwan community of Etsako West council of the state where three APC leaders defected to PDP. Addressing party members and supporters from both Anwan and Idegun, the governor promised to reciprocate the gesture by prioritising healthcare, education and agriculture in his second term if re-elected.
