A report the other day revealed how Nigeria, Africa’s richest and most populous nation missed out on the ongoing COVID-19 vaccine trials and race to end the pandemic. This is coming at a time the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19, is getting laid back on scientific research and development aspects of the medical emergency. However, it is not a time to overlook or give up on indigenous solutions. But by extension, deepening clinical and pharmaceutical capacities ahead of the feisty competition and pharmaceutical politics that await a cure remains germane, in this connection. 
 
Globally, the race for coronavirus vaccine is nearing a fever pitch. Besides the urgency to flatten the curve, save lives and arrest the devastating economic effects of the pandemic, the political motivation is most dominant among the active countries. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has received 166 potential vaccines out of which 19 are being tested on humans in clinical studies. Russia has taken everyone by surprise with its SARS-CoV-2 virus vaccine, already named Sputnik-V. Just after two months, the vaccine has scaled phase three hurdle and President Putin plans a roll out for January 1, 2021. The process is still raising curiosities in medical circles. In other countries, it takes as much as five to 10 years to get a vaccine ready.  But the numbers are not adding up in Nigeria and that may explain the lack of patronage. Despite our demographic advantage, Nigeria has one of the least numbers of COVID-19 tests, which makes our low incidences a suspect. Nigeria with 200 million people has tested fewer than one million cases to have over 46, 000 positive cases and 950 deaths. South Africa has less than 60 million people, but has conducted 3.2 million tests, with 563,000 positives and 10, 000-plus deaths. Egypt comes next to South Africa on the high prevalence scale, with 95,442 positive cases and over 5, 000 deaths.  Worst is the mutual distrust between government’s legislations, programmes and the people. The controversial Infectious Disease Control Bill episode at the National Assembly (NASS) was a bad advertisement for the country. The global community could glean from the legislative blunder and attendant meltdown that the most populous black nation has no collectively agreed infectious disease control laws, coupled with public phobia for emerging innovations. More so, the Nigerian public space is awash with diverse unscientific claims that linked coronavirus vaccines to human monitoring chips and signs of the apocalypse. Many, including the educated elite, still link 5G to the pandemic or dismiss the problem as a ruse. Such dizzying climate of confusion has never been productive to genuine scientific research and trails. 
 
The impediments are indeed enormous, but there is still no better time for the state actors to pay more attention to scientific core arms of the pandemic and less on the mundane fallouts of the problems itself. The Presidential Task Force has wasted too much free airtime talking about the problems than solutions. It is a known fact that Nigeria is yet to reach the peak of the pandemic as Boss Mustapha reiterated the other day. What he did not mention is knowledge-based efforts to prevent the worst and grim threshold of thousand-plus deaths. The truth is that most Nigerians are getting bored with routine pedestrian matters that are offshoots of the coronavirus. They want to hear new things that inspire hope like Nigeria contributing to the 1,439 recognised studies in the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) database. Nigerians want some feedback that our funded local researches are yielding fruits, promising in disease control and can save us from death. They want to hear the good news that Nigeria is leading the rest of the continent in the way of a sustainable solution to the existential crisis.
