 [FILES] Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun. Photo: twitter/dabiodunmfr  The two contenders, Chief Aremu Bamboye, a popular music promoter, and Chief Mukaila Atanda Akinwande are from the Parakoyi Council of Chiefs. Findings revealed that it was the turn of the Ogbonis, not Olorogun, or any other family to produce the new Oluwo, but because Ogbonis could not present a candidate; the mantle fell on the Parakoyis. It was revealed that the Odofin, the town’s substantive leader, handed over the selection process to Oluwo Agbein, Chief Femi Babalola, who picked and installed the Olori Aje, Bamgboye, being the head of the Parakoyi Council Of Chiefs, as the new Oluwo, after due consultation with the Alake of Egbaland. Further findings revealed that trouble started, when Odofin realised that his preferred candidate was not chosen, which necessitated moving his candidate to the Alake palace. Odofin, in his submission, according to a release, stated that in line with the Alake’s directives after the demise of the previous Oluwo, a new Oluwo should be chosen through the approved traditional system.
