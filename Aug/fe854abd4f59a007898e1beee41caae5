To many people across the world, football is a way of life. It is the only thing that makes existence meaningful. Football or soccer, as some in North America call it, is regarded as the king of sports, which draws millions of fans to stadiums and billions to television sets. Its pull is such that the developed world has built a massive economy around it, with thousands of youths leveraging their talents to escape poverty.
 
In some developed countries, the football economy contributes massively to the national GDP, such that the game and its properties are treated with reverence and always pampered to continue to yield fruits. Apart from the material wealth it gives to nations, talented players and officials, football has also been employed as a diplomatic tool, which plays vital roles in building good images for countries. Football has also been deployed by countries and international bodies to settle conflicts and to also build relationships.
 
There are numerous examples of the deployment of football to resolve internal strife, as is shown in the resolution of the Cote d’Ivoire civil war, where members of the Ivoirian national team, led by Didier Drogba, used their popularity to get the warring parties in the country’s crisis to sheathe their swords and settle the issues through the ballot box.  BUT the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) says there is no cause for alarm. Recently, the League Management Company, which runs the Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL), announced that it would test all the players, coaches and every other official that would be involved in the league’s restart for COVID-19, when the 2020/2021 competition kicks off. The LMC said the decision was part of the resolutions reached at its recent NFF board meeting held via videoconference.	 
  
The LMC said the pre-match tests would be done with the support of the Federal Ministry of Health and the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). The league body earlier announced that the competition would kick-off next month, but that date may not hold unless the Federal Government lifts its ban on sporting activities before the projected date. On August 6, 2020, the LMC reminded the NPFL clubs of the decision to begin the 2020/2021 season either by the end of September or in October and end it in May 2021 subject to the approval of government, health and other regulatory authorities. It advised the clubs on the need to comply with the club licensing regulations, adding, “there will be enhanced, robust and comprehensive implementation of these regulations, as well as other NPFL participation conditions, as enshrined in the NPFL rule book and other extant applicable documents.” It advised license applicants to use the intervening period to carry out all the necessary measures, including “upgrade of stadium facilities and familiarisation with other criteria as provided in the club licensing regulations to ensure they are fully compliant.” The body said it would carry out spot checks on all license applicants periodically to ensure full and sustained compliance by all participating clubs. At the weekend, LMC’s Chief Operating Officer, Salihu Abubakar, reiterated that the body was still waiting for directives from the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19, adding, “The September date announced for kick-off is to put the clubs on alert in case the PTF eases the lockdown on sports.
  
“There is no specified date announced by LMC for the kick-off of the NPFL. We are not giving guidelines on health measures to combat the COVID-19 pandemic yet. All we are waiting is for government to give the nod for sports to commence. As soon as the pronouncement is made officially, LMC will now act on the guidelines given by the government. The guidelines will be channelled to various clubs to put in place before the league kicks off.”
  
Even with the cautious mode adopted by the LMC, stakeholders believe that it would be asking for too much if the organisers of the league are expected to adopt the measures used by European nations in restarting their competitions. The argument is that Nigerian clubs do not have the basic medical requirements specified by the LMC for matches to hold in the country.
  
As shown by the death of Nasarawa United’s defender, Chineme Martins, during a 2019/2020 league game against Katsina United, most of the clubs don’t have functional ambulances, trained medical personnel and first aid kits in their home stadiums. Sports analyst, Sabinus Ikewuaku believes it would be foolhardy for Nigeria to try to emulate the advanced countries when its health facilities are not as developed as these countries.  “As a sportsman and coach in the NPFL, I want the league back,” he said. “I am always in touch with my players, encouraging them to be patient, and that the league will soon resume. But we must consider that the government’s aim is to fight COVID-19 and see it out of the country. Testing of footballers is not its priority now. It will not be easy for clubs to test players for COVID-19 without help from government. So on that premise, the resumption of the league next month is not feasible. COVID-19 has to go out of the country first for the league to kick off.” HOWEVER, Nigerian Rugby Football Federation’s (NRFF) national team doctor, Dr. Adebukola Bojuwoye, has a contrary view. Bojuwoye, who has also worked with some of the national football teams, believes the league can return in September/October if the safety guidelines are followed by the clubs and league organisers.
 
“It is possible for the NPFL to kick off at the announced date, because the players cannot keep staying at home because it will affect their physical abilities,” he said. “If such safety measures like quality healthcare facilities, including COVID-19 kits are provided, the league is good to start.
 
“But if there are no facilities for thorough checks of players and officials’ status; if the clubs cannot observe the anti-coronavirus protocols, as provided by the government, then it will not be possible for the league to start. The LMC should look for how to provide standard COVID-19 test kits for all the clubs before the kick off date.” While some stakeholders have expressed doubts about the feasibility of the September date, secretary of the Club Owners Association of Nigeria, Alloy Chukwuemeka, said everything needed for the commencement of the league is already in place. Chukwuemeka, who believes the country has the capacity to ensure players and officials’ lives are not endangered when the league kicks off, said the clubs were only waiting for the federal government’s approval for the competition to commence.
  
“Yes, the league’s resumption date has been tentatively fixed for September/October and the clubs are ready,” he stated. “Once government lifts the restrictions on sporting activities, the league will start. The clubs’ owners are already making plans to ensure top health facilities are on ground to test players and also ensure the football pitches are adequate for standard league games.
 
“This COVID-19 pandemic has given the clubs’ owners more insight on how to lift the standard of teams and ensure players and officials’ security. We are adopting a system that will ensure that the standard in Enyimba FC is replicated in Kano Pillars and other clubs in Nigeria.
  
“There is a bright future for the NPFL, and as I told you, the COVID-19 issues have given the association insight on how to transform the league. The September/October resumption schedule was picked to allow government time to work out the solution to the pandemic. Once the lockdown is lifted, the NPFL will kick off.”
 
Also assuring that his team is ready for the 2020/2021 season’s kick-off, Enugu Rangers’ General Manager, Davidson Owumi, said the ‘Flying Antelopes’ have acquired every material necessary for the task ahead.
  
Owumi said the club’s “coaching crew is at work and will soon come up with a list of players retained and those that will bid us bye for the season. For management, it is our belief that only a handful of quality legs will be sourced to fill noticed lapses in the team.” He revealed that the coaches, led by former Super Eagles Assistant Coach, Salisu Yusuf, would soon release the list of players selected to fight Rangers’ battles in the coming season, adding that the target is to beat the fourth position they got when the 2019/20 season was abruptly halted.
  
At the weekend, the Federal Government announced that it had lifted its ban on non-contact outdoor sports, while also approving the use of recreational parks for physical exercises under strict supervision. National Coordinator of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19, Dr. Sani Aliyu, said in Abuja on Thursday that the Federal Government had decided to ease the restriction on outdoor non-contact sports but stressed that recreational parks are not to be used for social interaction purposes.
