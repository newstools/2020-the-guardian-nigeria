During the music video, the couple embrace on the shoreline as Teigen cradles her growing baby bump.  The music video was directed by Nabil Elderkin, who first introduced Legend to Teigen 14 years ago on the set of his video for “Stereo”. Legend met model Chrissy Teigen in 2006 when Elderkin introduced the two during her appearance in the music video for his song “Stereo”. They became engaged in December 2011 and were married on September 14, 2013, in Como, Italy. The 2013 song “All of Me” was written and is dedicated to her; the music video was reportedly displayed at their wedding.
