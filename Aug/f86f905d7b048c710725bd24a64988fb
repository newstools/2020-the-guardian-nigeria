Just days after testing positive for coronavirus, Lagos State health commissioner Akin Abayomi has recovered from the virus. “It is with gratitude to God that I announce the recovery and subsequent negative test for COVID-19 of the Honorable Commissioner for Health, Professor Akin Abayomi,” Lagos information commissioner Gbenga Omotoso tweeted on Monday. “Following the mandatory isolation, the Commissioner retook a COVID-19 PCR test which returned negative yesterday evening.” Abayomi joins the list of many Nigerian public officers that have recovered from the virus, although a few others, including Abba Kyari, former chief of staff to President Muhammadu Buhari and Abiola Ajimobi, a former governor of Oyo State, have died from the virus complications. The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control on Sunday night announced 138 new cases of COVID-19, bringing the nation’s confirmed cases to 53,865.
