Pentecostal bishops decry Kaduna attacks
Northern Christian Eldersâ€™ Forum, Plateau State chapter, has called on the Federal Government to end the wanton destruction of lives and property in parts of the country. After its congress in Jos yesterday, the forum expressed concern over insecurity in the country, particularly the killings in southern Kaduna. Describing the killings as unacceptable, the Christian elders commended the Federal Government for its efforts in stemming the tide, advising it to handle the Kaduna case as it was doing the terrorism in the North East and banditry in the North West. Chairman of the forum, Chief John Mankilik, sued for unity of purpose among communities in the country. Similarly, the Pentecostal Bishops Forum of the 19 Northern states has decried the attacks by bandits and terrorists, especially on the defenceless people of southern Kaduna and innocent Nigerians. It demanded immediate arrest and prosecution of the perpetrators and their sponsors. The bishops urged the Federal Government to equally address crises in other troubled regions of the country, stressing that failure to act now might compel people to resort to self help and reprisals, which would snowball into a conflagration of monumental proportion. Briefing journalists yesterday in Abuja, Chairman of the Forum, Archbishop John Daniel, lamented that the situation in Kaduna had assumed a dangerous dimension of ethnic cleansing. He alleged that the audacity of the recent attacks and the inactions of security agencies suggested a wicked collaboration, double standard and sabotage in certain quarters.
