The protests had been called by opposition politician Jacob Ngarivhume, head of a small party called Transform Zimbabwe, against alleged state corruption and the country’s slumping economy. Police banned the protests and government described them as an “insurrection”. Amnesty International has condemned what it calls the “witch-hunt and repression of peaceful dissent.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
