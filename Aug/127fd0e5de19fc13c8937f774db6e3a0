Nigeria President Muhammadu Buhari has sacked Charles Quarker Dokubo as the coordinator of the Amnesty Programme. “Prof. Dokubo has been directed to hand over all official matters to the most senior officer of the Programme,” a presidential spokesman Garba Shehu said in a statement. “This followed the President’s approval of the disengagement of Prof. Charles Quarker Dokubo from Office as the Coordinator, Amnesty Programme with immediate effect.” Buhari had suspended Dokubo in February over allegations of financial misconduct and mismanagement in the Amnesty Programme. The presidency explained that the National Security Adviser (NSA) had set up a Caretaker Committee to look into the activities of the programme, on the directive of President Buhari. “Part of the Committee’s task is to ensure that allocated resources are properly utilized in consonance with government’s objective of alleviating problems in the Niger Delta region, and stamping out corruption in the Amnesty Programme. “Consequently, the NSA recommended to Mr President that the Coordinator of the Amnesty Programme, Professor Charles Quaker Dokubo be suspended, a recommendation that has been approved and which takes immediate effect. “The President has also directed that the Caretaker Committee set up to review the programme should oversee the running of the programme henceforth, with a view to ensuring that government objectives are achieved.” Dokubo had succeeded Paul Boroh, who was also removed by the president in 2018, following allegations of corruption. Consequently, Buhari appointed Dikio (rtd) as Interim Administrator of the Amnesty Programme with effect from August 21, 2020. “President Buhari appreciated the services of Prof. Dokubo to the Federal Republic of Nigeria and wished him the best in his future endeavours,” Shehu said.
