Nigerians football and martial arts fans are in for a thrilling weekend, which offers them the best of football in the Europa League final, as well as battles in the cage of One Championship martial arts. In the Europa League final, Inter Milan will face Sevilla tomorrow at the RheinEnergie Stadium in Cologne by 8.00 p.m., while the martial art event organised by One Championship, tagged ‘No Surrender III’, will hold by 1.30 p.m. Both events will be broadcast to Nigerian audience by pay television outfit, StarTimes. No Surrender III concludes an epic month of non-stop martial arts action in Bangkok with six incredible matchups featuring more of the world’s best martial artists. Later tomorrow evening, football will take the centre seat as Inter Milan battle Sevilla for the king of Europa football 2019/20. No club has won the competition more times than Sevilla (five times). What makes Sevilla’s success even more remarkable is the fact that tomorrow will mark the fifth time since 2014 that they have made it through to the championship match. The La Liga club came from a goal down to qualify for the final with a 2-1 victory against Manchester United, while Inter Milan trounced Shakhtar Donetsk 5-0 in their semi-final, in a match in which the result though betrays the possession – most of which the Ukrainian club had throughout.
