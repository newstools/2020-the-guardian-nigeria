The safe reopening of schools “today is our top priority”, he said. One of the first countries in Europe to be struck by coronavirus, Italy shuttered schools on March 5 and since then learning has been very limited. Ten days ago the government published new protocols to deal with renewed outbreaks of coronavirus which has killed almost 35,500 people so far, according to official statistics. The protocols include the immediate quarantine of those who were in “close contact” with a pupil or teacher who tests positive for Covid-19. Face masks are mandatory for all children over the age of six when they move around the schools except for gym class, eating in canteens and answering a teacher. Italy has also dropped off 2.4 million individual desks and will daily hand out millions of face masks and as well as 170,000 litres of disinfectant gel every week. But uncertainty remains ahead of school’s reopening. Several regions including Puglia and Calabria in the south have postponed reopening until September 24 and others are considering doing the same. President Sergio Mattarella on Monday urged Italy to “effectively face its responsibilities in this difficult time, saying schools were a “decisive resource”.
