When a video surfaced on the internet of Peter Okoye, a member of the defunct Psquare, saying that Psquare was back, not a few people were excited. In the video, he took responsibility for the issues that have happened. “We have resolved our issues and we seek for your forgiveness. I will take full responsibility for everything that has happened… We look forward to the future with excitement and renewed energy,” he said in part. Jude Okoye Responds To Cynthia Morgan And May D’s Allegations Recall that the duo and twins, Peter and Paul, split in 2017 following rumours that Peter no longer wanted Jude, their brother to be involved in their affairs. Jude until that time was their manager. A year before the split, a disagreement ensued after Peter claimed that one party of the group received more input of songs in their joint albums. In fact, Jude confirmed that Paul wanted him out of the group in an Instagram Live in May of this year, and added that “there is nothing humanly possible for me to do to bring Psquare back.” Paul, on the other hand, remained remotely silent on the issue. So when the video surfaced today, it sparked a light in the heart of fans. Peter and Paul them be one no be two. Meaning that when they separated they were giving us half half lol Looking forward to what they create especially now that African music has really evolved — Shaykeh (@Shaykssss) August 17, 2020 <img class="aligncenter wp-image-1202538 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WhatsApp-Image-2020-08-17-at-8.30.05-PM-337x598.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="2274" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WhatsApp-Image-2020-08-17-at-8.30.05-PM-337x598.jpeg 337w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WhatsApp-Image-2020-08-17-at-8.30.05-PM-314x557.jpeg 314w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WhatsApp-Image-2020-08-17-at-8.30.05-PM-135x240.jpeg 135w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WhatsApp-Image-2020-08-17-at-8.30.05-PM-270x480.jpeg 270w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WhatsApp-Image-2020-08-17-at-8.30.05-PM-338x600.jpeg 338w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WhatsApp-Image-2020-08-17-at-8.30.05-PM.jpeg 608w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> From all indications, this might as well signal the end of the sparks fly fans have had.
