Conference of Speakers of State Legislatures in Nigeria has condemned the recent siege on Edo State House of Assembly by men suspected to be loyal to Governor Godwin Obaseki.
 
In a statement, yesterday, Conference Chairman and Speaker, Lagos State House of Assembly, Mr. Mudashiru Obasa, said removing roofs of the hallowed Assembly was an injury to Nigeria’s democracy and must be condemned by well-meaning Nigerians. He described the brazen manner suspected political thugs took over the Assembly as sheer recklessness. It said Obaseki’s action was autocratic and dictatorial.  “The Conference wonders how the idea of renovating the Assembly suddenly came up, just weeks to the governorship election in the state, and in such manner of creating a mockery of the electioneering process and democracy. “Why is the government just realising the need to renovate the complex at the twilight of the administration? “What happens to the building, if the governor does not return? What happens if the next administration does not take that direction?” 
 
The conference further questioned the role played by the Edo State Commissioner of Police in the entire drama. They accused the Police Commissioner of allowing himself to be used as a tool to perpetrate an attack on democracy.
