Effects include increased cancer risk, cellular stress, increase in harmful free radicals, genetic damages, structural and functional changes of the reproductive system, learning and memory deficits, neurological disorders, and negative impacts on general well-being in humans. Damage goes well beyond the human race, as there is growing evidence of harmful effects to both plant and animal life. Indeed, scientists engaged in the study of biological and health effects of EMF have raised fresh alarm. Based on their peer-reviewed, published research, the scientists said they have serious concerns regarding the ubiquitous and increasing exposure to EMF generated by electric and wireless devices. These include–but are not limited to–radiofrequency radiation (RFR) emitting devices, such as cellular and cordless phones and their base stations, Wi-Fi, broadcast antennas, smart meters, and baby monitors, as well as electric devices and infra-structure used in the delivery of electricity that generate extremely-low frequency electromagnetic field (ELF EMF). The scientists led by the Director, EMFscientist.org, at info@EMFscientist.org, Elizabeth Kelley, said these findings justify their appeal to the United Nations (UN) and, all member States in the world, to encourage the World Health Organisation (WHO) to exert strong leadership in fostering the development of more protective EMF guidelines, encouraging precautionary measures, and educating the public about health risks, particularly risk to children and fetal development. They said by not taking action, the WHO is failing to fulfill its role as the preeminent international public health agency. The scientists said the various agencies setting safety standards have failed to impose sufficient guidelines to protect the general public, particularly children who are more vulnerable to the effects of EMF. To address the situation, scientists have developed radioactive shield against EMF. The product is an effective multi-protection against harmful EMF induced cancers, virus attacks and other diseases; and it is aimed at helping to improve human life expectancy, sustaining individual’s health, income and economic values of the nations in this modern day of EMF (Radiation/radio frequencies) exposure and emission technologies The product is a two-micro-Siemens EMF shield designed and manufactured by Chonik Electronics Limited, a biotechnology company in Lagos, Nigeria, which is now soliciting financial support from the government and other stake- holders for full commercialisation of the product. Managing Director of the company, Mr. Nwakor Uche Joseph, said the company was spurred into action by the International Agency For Research on Cancer (IARC/WHO) reports on “Radio Frequencies and cancers” and other health issues. Nwakor said the shield is sensitive to electromagnetic radiation environments. He added: “It is also sensitive to the European, American and Asian countries’ electromagnetic fields, radiation detector and anti- radiation efficacy tester. Scientifically, the shield helps human body to withstand the automatic response tests, which further confirms the efficacy of the shield. It is manufactured in consideration of the SAR Values of various mobile cell phones and other electrical/electronic gadgets from American, Asian and European countries. It also considers the perfection and imperfection capacities, alkaline base and temperature regulatory mechanisms of other radiation shields, and also human body mass/ weights in different environments and locations. “It is certified by Lagos State Environmental and Product Protection Agency (LASEPA) and standard organisation of Nigeria.” Comparing the 5G Technologies and Chonik Radioactive Shield, a consultant engineer working with the company, Okafor Julius, said that the 5G is the latest telecom technology just ahead of 4G. “The 5G technology in itself does not carry any cancer virus or any other virus for that matter, but it may come with a very high frequency, shortwave length, high speed and dangerous rays (EMF radiation/ radio frequencies) which has gradual or instant negative effects in human body. It may destroy the body tissues and cells and even the Deoxy ribonucleic Acid (DNA)/genetic material, five times more than the 4G, 3G or what we are used to thus reducing human immunity,” he said. Okafor added: “This allows all manner of sickness, virus and diseases to penetrate human body and cause cancer, weakness, genetic changes and other undesirable hereditary effects.
But with Radioactive Shield, you are 100 per cent protected from any kind of radiation be it from 5G, 4G, 3G, GSM phones, microwave ovens, telecom masts name it. “It is an extractive and composite product from Natural Mineral Resources such has lead, copper, sodium/calcium, potassium and cadmium in their liquid forms. It operates at the energy level of two micro-Siemens using the simple physics principle of electromagnetic permeability. Lead is a radiation emission-fighting agent, which is also present in lead apron worn by radiologist during X-rays in medical examination in hospitals against X-rays radiation. “Radioactive Shield enables human being to relate, interact and stay safe in radioactivity environment. It has a life span of two years. It is self-energising and simple to use. It is important that every household, private sectors and government establishments acquire this product and stay safe.” Meanwhile, the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) established in 1998 the “Guidelines For Limiting Exposure To Time-Varying Electric, Magnetic, and Electromagnetic Fields (up to 300 GHz)”. The WHO and numerous countries around the world accept these guidelines. The WHO is calling for all nations to adopt the ICNIRP guidelines to encourage international harmonization of standards. In 2009, the ICNIRP released a statement saying that it was reaffirming its 1998 guidelines, as in their opinion, the scientific literature published since that time “has provided no evidence of any adverse effects below the basic restrictions and does not necessitate an immediate revision of its guidance on limiting exposure to high frequency electromagnetic fields. ICNIRP continues to the present day to make these assertions, in spite of growing scientific evidence to the contrary. It is our opinion that, because the ICNIRP guidelines do not cover long-term exposure and low-intensity effects, they are insufficient to protect public health. The WHO adopted the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classification of extremely low frequency electromagnetic field (ELF EMF) in 2002 and radiofrequency radiation (RFR) in 2011. This classification states that EMF is a possible human carcinogen (Group 2B). Despite both IARC findings, the WHO continues to maintain that there is insufficient evidence to justify lowering these quantitative exposure limits. The scientists said since there is controversy about a rationale for setting standards to avoid adverse health effects, they recommend that the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) convene and fund an independent multidisciplinary committee to explore the pros and cons of alternatives to current practices that could substantially lower human exposures to RF and ELF fields. The deliberations of this group should be conducted in a transparent and impartial way. Although it is essential that industry be involved and cooperate in this process, industry should not be allowed to bias its processes or conclusions. This group should provide their analysis to the UN and the WHO to guide precautionary action. The scientists collectively request that: children and pregnant women be protected; guidelines and regulatory standards be strengthened; manufacturers be encouraged to develop safer technology; utilities responsible for the generation, transmission, distribution, and monitoring of electricity maintain adequate power quality and ensure proper electrical wiring to minimize harmful ground current; the public be fully informed about the potential health risks from electromagnetic energy and taught harm reduction strategies; medical professionals be educated about the biological effects of electromagnetic energy and be provided training on treatment of patients with electromagnetic sensitivity; governments fund training and research on electromagnetic fields and health that is independent of industry and mandate industry cooperation with researchers; media disclose experts’ financial relationships with industry when citing their opinions regarding health and safety aspects of EMF-emitting technologies; and white-zones (radiation-free areas) be established. Signatories to these demands include scientists from: Armenia, Australia, Austria, Bahrain, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Croatia, Egypt, Estonia, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Iceland, India, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Israel, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Kazakhstan, New Zealand, Nigeria, Oman, Poland, Romania, Russian Federation, Serbia, Slovak Republic, South Korea (Republic of Korea), Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan (Republic of China), Turkey, Ukraine, United Kingdom (UK), and United States of America (USA).
