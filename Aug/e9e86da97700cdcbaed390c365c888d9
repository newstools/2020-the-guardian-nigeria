Kastina State Governor Aminu Masari has identified lack of cooperation from communities affected by banditry as a major setback in the war against insecurity challenge in the state. According to the governor, as long as locals shield suspected bandits or refuse to divulge information about them to security agencies, the end to the problem may still be far-fetched. He was speaking over the weekend while hosting the Chief of Air Staff (CAS), Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar, and the air component of Operation Hadarin Daji stationed in the state, to Sallah lunch. Attacks in frontline councils by bandits in recent months have halted socio-economic activities in many of the affected communities. More than 150 people have reportedly lost their lives and hundreds of others injured during such attacks this year alone. But the governor said, “a successful war against banditry is a product of local communities providing information” on bandits’ hide-outs, identity as well as their informants. Said he: “Without the cooperation of local communities with credible information, it will be difficult to win the war against bandits. “Local communities are aware of the hide-outs and identities of the bandits, but are not ready to provide credible information to security agents.” Masari, however, warned residents against sheltering or shielding suspected bandits, as those found culpable would be made to face the law. He assured them that the state government would, within available resources, continue to assist the military to ensure that peace returned to the state. Earlier, the CAS had said that the Federal Government would soon commence construction of an aircraft hangar in the state. He added that the construction of the hangar would add value to the serviceability of aircraft operating in the North West geopolitical zone.
