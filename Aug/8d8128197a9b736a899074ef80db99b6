Jovita Nsoh, Regional CTO, Strategy & Innovation, Microsoft  Members of the Regulatory Affairs Committee act in their personal capacity and gather decades of experience within the public and private sector, with a strong legal expertise of African and global energy markets.  Given increasing competition for investment and challenging market conditions, the right to adopt market-driven policies and promote an enabling business environment across Africa is greater than ever. Acting as the link between the public and private sector, the African Energy Chamber strongly believes that a recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic will require a stronger emphasis on market-driven policies, investors-friendly environments and regulations that embrace digitization so African markets can compete for capital and technology globally.  “African markets must stay competitive and must do better at attracting investment and respecting the sanctity of contracts,” declared Nj Ayuk, Executive Chairman at the African Energy Chamber. “From adopting progressive local content legislation to implementing better fiscal regimes, African energy markets must seize the opportunity offered by the global pandemic to review their existing frameworks, keep what is working and amend what is slowing down the pace of investment in the continent,” he added.
