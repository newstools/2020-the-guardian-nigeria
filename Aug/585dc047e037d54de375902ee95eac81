Rumour That Annabelle’s Real Life Doll Escaped Its Museum Debunked Contrary to recent rumours, the real-life Annabelle doll has not escaped from The Warren’s Occult Museum in Connecticut. Featured in The Conjuring universe, this demonic plaything remains inside her glass case, previously owned by the late paranormal investigators, Ed and Lorraine Warren. Their son-in-law Tony Spera shared the news in a YouTube video on Friday after Annabelle’s Wikipedia page was edited to suggest she’d somehow broken out of the museum. He said: I’m here to tell you something. I don’t know if you want to hear this or not, but Annabelle did not escape,” he explained from inside the now-defunct museum. Annabelle’s alive, well, I shouldn’t say alive, Annabelle’s here, in all her infamous glory. She never left the museum. Remember, I have high-tech security here. If she had left the museum I’d instantly know if something happened or somebody broke in. I have good alarm systems here and the police are very good to respond. They respond within a couple of minutes, maybe, if that. So you know, here she is. Let’s put the rumours to rest, guys. I appreciate all the concern. I’d be concerned if Annabelle really did leave because she’s nothing to play with. Pointing the camera at the genuine Annabelle doll, Tony joked: “Annabelle’s here. She didn’t go anywhere. She didn’t take a trip. She didn’t fly first class and she didn’t go out to visit her boyfriend.” Annabelle is a 2014 American supernatural horror film directed by John R. Leonetti, written by Gary Dauberman and produced by Peter Safran and James Wan. It is a prequel to 2013’s The Conjuring and the second installment in The Conjuring Universe franchise. The film was inspired by a story of a doll named Annabelle told by Ed and Lorraine Warren.
