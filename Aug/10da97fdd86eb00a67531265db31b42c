The OGPF is an anti corruption, transparency body championing openness in governance around the world. The Registrar-General, Garba Abubakar, who disclosed this in an exclusive interview with The Guardian, said the grant, which drawdown has begun, will be channelled towards the upgrade of the CAC information processes, to achieve an end-to-end operation to cut down on delays and human interface. Abubakar declared that the development comes on the back of the August 31, 2020, deadline for zero physical applications or customers in all of its offices across the country. He said: “It is a multi-donor fund of the Open Government Partnership Forum. But the World Bank is administering it on behalf of OGPF. “We are now trying to leverage on technology to sanitize the system. We have gone ahead to acquire laptops for staff, so that some middle level as well as senior level officers can work from their comfort zones; and moving forward, we are coming up with the use of technology so that our customers do not have to come here, while companies can do their transactions from anywhere. “They can have their own unique account to file in their applications so much so that they don’t have to come here. This is the way the world is operating; you don’t see customers around any CAC anywhere in the world. Already, we have something in place, but not adequate enough and we have covered our 50 percent requirement. We are working hard to have a very robust solution that will allow us to render services to our numerous customers electronically so that anybody can deal with us from everywhere. “The technology we are trying to deploy is a registry solution. It has to be customized; the difference between us in CAC and other organisations is that we are the only one that transacts this kind of service, so any application we are deploying must be the one that is customized. “We have gotten approvals from the World Bank already to fund a development customer registry in Nigeria, so the World Bank has earmarked some funds for this, and we hope to soon move on to the procurement stage and that aspect of the new law is being taken care of by the World Bank,” Abubakar further disclosed.
