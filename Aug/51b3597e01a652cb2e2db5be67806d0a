Following the attack on Borno State Governor Babagana Zulum, the Shehu of Borno, Alhaji Abubakar el-Kanemi, has declared the state unsafe. Boko Haram terrorists attacked Zulum, the state’s chief security officer, and his security details last Thursday on their way to Baga town to assess the security situation in the Lake Chad Basin. The governor’s convoy had previously been attacked early this year while he was returning from Konduga, 40 kilometres east of Maiduguri, to distribute food to returning displaced persons and inspect a 500-unit housing project for the returnees. “Borno State is no longer safe,” the monarch said at the weekend during his traditional Sallah greetings to the governor at his Maiduguri official residence. “Your Excellency, we are not happy about what happened in Baga the other time. It is very unfortunate and a great pity to expose people’s lives to Boko Haram terrorists,” he declared. “If the convoy of the chief security officer of the state would be attacked, then I swear that nobody is safe, because he is the number one citizen of the state.” He feared that the security situation in the state got worse since the emergence of Boko Haram in 2009. Despite the attacks, he urged everyone to look up to God and seek his protection. On the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) that has claimed many lives and spread to Maiduguri Metropolitan Council (MMC) Biu, Jere, Dikwa and Gwoza, he called on the citizens to continue adhere to the safety protocols of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and other experts. The monarch also spoke on environmental degradation and deforestation in the state, which he warned would lead to disaster if authorities fail to act. On his part, Zulum thanked the Shehu for the visit and assured him of government’s readiness to address the issues he raised.
