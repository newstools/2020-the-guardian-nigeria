It would be recalled that the Deputy Governor and his wife, Abieyuwa, underwent COVID-19 test after they showed slight symptoms of the virus and were confirmed positive. According to Ajakaiye, this means the Deputy Governor is free of the virus and would be back to his desk. “The government thanks members of the public for their support and prayers, and the medical team for their hard work. “The government equally wishes all of our remaining patients, including the wife of the Deputy Governor, safe recovery like the Deputy Governor,” he said.
