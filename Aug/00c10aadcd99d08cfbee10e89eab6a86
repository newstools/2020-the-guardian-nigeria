Barely 24 hours after Air Peace sacked 75 pilots, Bristow Helicopters yesterday fell in line, terminating the contract of over 100 pilots and engineers in its operations.
  
Some of the affected workers, in collaboration with the National Association of Aircraft Pilots and Engineers (NAAPE), had on Monday embarked on indefinite strike, picketing the airline office in Lagos over welfare issues and alleged infractions.
  
Apparently displeased with the actions, the management fired the majority of the staffers including some expatriates, with an offer of three-month salary as redundancy compensation.  Bristow added that the decision had not been made lightly, but having considered the state of the business and the very serious constraints caused by the spread of the COVID-19 disease and the downturn in the oil and gas market. “The company must now take this painful, but decisive step to ensure the continuity of its business and delivery of essential services to its clients.” 
   
In compliance with the relevant labour and local content laws and also best practices; the company engaged the leadership of NAAPE to negotiate a fair and equitable redundancy compensation for the affected individuals. 
  
“In compliance with the terms of employment, the affected individuals will be paid three months’ salary, excluding applicable deductions, following their exit from the company.  The redundancy packages will be paid to them as soon as an agreement has been reached with NAAPE,” the state read in part.
