The Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC) has denied receiving funds from a terrorist organisation in or outside Nigeria. The group director, Prof. Ishaq Akintola, in a statement on Tuesday, said reports linking it to Islamic State for West Africa Province (ISWAP) is illogical, adding that it never had any contact with any terrorist group. Akintola said the group had always condemned every act of terror whether it happened within or outside Nigeria, saying “the motto of MURIC is ‘dialogue, not violence”. “Our attention has been drawn to a rumour making the rounds in mainstream and social media circles that MURIC received $200,000 from ISWAP. It is a wicked concoction and a lie from the pit of Jahannam. We declare clearly, categorically and unequivocally that we have never had any contact with ISWAP or any other terrorist group. “So how can we descend so low as to collect money from terrorists? Such lies will not fly. The terrorists themselves know that we can never support them. So how can they give us money? The allegation is dead on arrival. “We are a disciplined group. We have never been known to engage in any violent protest or attack since we established MURIC in 1994. It is most diabolical to accuse a group that has pursued peaceful advocacy for twenty-six (26) years of having any connection with terrorists.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
