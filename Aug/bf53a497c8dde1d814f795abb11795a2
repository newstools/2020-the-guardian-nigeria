 Muhammadu Buhari PHOTO: Twitter  Oshiomhole was taken to the President’s office by the Chief of Staff, Prof Ibrahim Gambari. Details of a scheduled meeting was not made public, but it is gathered that the parley will not be unconnected with the internal crisis besetting the ruling APC and the forthcoming September 19 governorship election in Edo State. Following the commencement of electioneering campaigns for the governorship election, the APC and the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) have continued to fight dirty over who takes over Government House on Osadebey Avenue, Benin City. The fierce campaign between PDP and APC candidates and supporters has many worrying about the likelihood of violence that may characterise the election next month. The division among party loyalists and supporters of the two leading political parties has not only caused rancour and betrayal of trust among politicians and supporters, it has left many defecting from one party to the other. Most members dumping PDP for APC blame it on the incumbent governor’s leadership style, describing him as being too rigid, while others are dumping the latter for PDP because of what they term Oshiomhole’s past sins.
