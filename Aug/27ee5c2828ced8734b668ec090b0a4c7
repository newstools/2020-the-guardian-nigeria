Recreational activities resumed yesterday at the Ikoyi Club, Lagos, with low turnout after five months of lockdown by the government due to the outbreak of coronavirus. As the government began the gradual ease of restrictions in May, the Lagos State Safety Commission (LSSC) had, in June 2020, visited the club and issued the Provisional Safety Compliance Clearance to enable it commence recreational activities. However, in line with the government’s procedure for gradual reopening of activities, the club has modified its operations to accommodate the COVID-19 protocol. Recreational activities in the club include table tennis, squash, badminton, lawn games, golf and aerobics. Unlike in the past where members are allowed to come and play games at will, no member is allowed to stay above one hour irrespective of their games. Members were asked to display their financial cards before entry while they are subjected to fill a register, which entails the phone number of their next of kin. One of the members who visited refused to use the available pen for registration, saying the information being filled pose security risk to members. Information obtained from club’s website in its phase one of gradual reopening revealed that anyone with body temperature of 37.5°C and above will not be allowed into the club premises. The policy of ‘No face mask, no entry’ is in place, and every person within the club premises must wear a face mask at all times, stating that the use of mask while playing or working out is optional. The club added that no children, junior members, visitors or guests would be allowed into the club during this phase. It also revealed that all bars, kitchens and restaurants remain shut, while only water will be available for sale in the club. It noted that all sporting activities will stop at 7:00p.m. daily with skeletal services being provided by the staff and the club will close at 8:00p.m. Also, the management, in separate notice to members, said: “Nannies, domestic servants, minders, bodyguards, aides and drivers will not be allowed in the club at any time and cannot be signed in as guest. Any infringement of this rule will be dealt with under Rule 9. A non-financial member of the club shall not be signed in as guest.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
