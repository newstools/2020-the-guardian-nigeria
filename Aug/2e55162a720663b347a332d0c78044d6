Quiet celebrations and slight breaches of COVID-19 safety protocols shaped the observance of this year’s Eid el-Kabir by Muslims in the Ado-Odo/Ota Local Government Area of Ogun State.
 
The Guardian observed that Muslims didn’t gather for Eid prayers at most of the designated praying grounds in the council area as they settled for having the prescribed Nawafil (Eid prayers) with family members.
 
Describing this year’s celebration, a textile dealer who came to town to celebrate, Shakirah Akande, observed that “it was more of a reunion for me than Sallah, catching up with my aunts, uncles and cousins. There was no congregational prayer in Agbara, but I observed nafilat with my mum and dad at home.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
