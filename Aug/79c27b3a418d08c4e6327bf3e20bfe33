Friendship Goals: Cardi B Gifts Meghan Thee Stallion A Personalised Birkin Bag Cardi B and Meghan Thee Stallion’ WAP has enjoyed record-breaking streams in its first week and currently sits at number one on the Billboard Hot 100. To celebrate their shared success, Cardi sent over a special gift to Hot Girl Meg this week: a custom Birkin bag. And the one-of-a-kind creation is a must-see. This is the type of friendship you shout “God when” to. She gifted her co-rapper the covetable handbag in orange but took it to the next level. It appears that she had an artist make it even rarer by painting a picture of Meg on the bag. On the front, Megan Thee Stallion is illustrated in her tiger-print outfit from the ‘WAP’ video, alongside a tiger. On the back, a skyline of Houston, where Megan Thee Stallion is from, is depicted with “Be Someone” written overtop it. The rapper seemed completely surprised when she opened the thoughtful present, exclaiming, “Not the Birkin. Not the Houston Birkin!” On the bottom of the bag, a custom note from Cardi reads, “Thank you Meg, really appreciate you!,” and on the bottom right, another signature reads “K. Holland ’04.” Below is her post on Instagram:   My manager just walked in and said cardi sent you something  not the birkinnnnnnnn  thank you frennn omg I can’t believe you  I wonder what I’m gonna get her  @iamcardib A post shared by  Hot Girl Meg (@theestallion) on Aug 17, 2020 at 6:07pm PDT
