Chris Brown and Ammika Harris | Image: In Touch Weekly Recent social media post by Chris Brown and Ammika Harris, the mother of his eight-month-old son Aeko, have fueled rumours of a break-up. Hours after Brown posted a picture of his hand and legs along with the caption, “YOU GONE CRY ON MY BUS OR DA BUS !?” on his Instagram page, Harris, on her Instagram story put up a text picture which read, “I’m at the ‘don’t talk to me unless you wanna wife me’ stage.”   YOU GONE CRY ON MY BUS OR DA BUS !? A post shared by  CHRIS BROWN (@chrisbrownofficial) on Aug 14, 2020 at 1:34am PDT  This is coming weeks after the couple abruptly stopped following each other on Instagram. Brown unfollowed almost everyone except an account dedicated to his six-year-old daughter Royalty Brown, as well as that of Nike’s Jordan line. Except for a few suggestive comments which keep fans guessing, Chris Brown and Ammika Harris have relatively kept quiet about the status of their relationship. On July 17, Brown left the comment, “HI MOMMA,” in all caps next to an eye and heart emoji when Ammika shared an IG photo in a strapless dress. Brown’s comment prompted followers in the comments to ask him to “put a ring on it”. In May, Brown appeared to confirm his relationship with Ammika Harris when he shared a now-deleted picture of Harris on his Instagram page. “HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO MY BOO. THE ONLY OTHER PERSON THAT LOOKS AT YOU THE WAY I DO IS AEKO,” he wrote in the caption. Brown continued, “WHEN WE FIRST ME I GOT ON YA NERVES… you told me I talk too much… SO THEN I SHUT THE F*** UP AND STARTED LISTENING! YOU ARE LIGHT, YOU ARE LOVE, and you are BEAUTY. THIS YO DAY…. I LOVE YOU. TELL MOMS THANK YOU”. HollywoodLife reports that Ammika and Aeko are still living in Germany, while Chris resides in Los Angeles.
