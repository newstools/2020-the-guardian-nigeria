Kallon, in a statement, yesterday, in Maiduguri, disclosed that the Coronavirus pandemic has exacerbated humanitarian situation in Borno, Adamawa and Yobe. He said the meeting was attended by Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Hajiya Sadiya Farouq, Borno State Governor, Babagana Zulum, as well as other UN and NGO representatives. He solicited support for vulnerable people in the Northeast, as “the number of persons in need of life-saving aid had risen steeply.” He said: “The number of people needing assistance is the highest ever recorded in five years of a joint humanitarian response. “COVID-19 pandemic is affecting us all. It’s devastating effects will distress Nigeria’s most fragile region.
“Unless we take immediate action, we should prepare for a spike in conflict, hunger and destitution in Northeast Nigeria.” He called on donor agencies to step up support for the vulnerable and demonstrate solidarity as aid workers have received less than 30 per cent of needed resources since January this year.
