Photo; BT  The report also revealed that Customer Delivery Inspections (CDI) effectively exposes counterfeit print supplies, with 96 per cent of customers feeling protected from activities of fraudsters. The survey conducted in Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) by HP revealed that over the last five years, HP has supported local law enforcement authorities to seize around 12.5 million items, including counterfeit cartridges, hardware products, and components. Most recently, between October 2019 and March 2020, HP, together with local authorities in Kenya, Nigeria and Tanzania, successfully obstructed a number of counterfeit trading programmes and removed close to 200,000 illicit products from the African region, including fake printer cartridges and components to assemble further counterfeits. The Global Lead of Supplies Anti-Counterfeit and Fraud Programme, Suanne Schoewitz-Franchi, said with the CDIs, which is a free and effective feature of HPâ€™s anti-counterfeit and fraud programme, customers get a reliable way to confirm the authenticity of their stock, which involves on-site checks of suspicious large or mid-sized cartridge deliveries in response to reports initiated by HP customers.
