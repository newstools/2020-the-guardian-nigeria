• As Articulated Vehicles Return On Apapa/Oshodi Road As articulated vehicles return on Apapa/Oshodi expressway in Lagos State, compounding the agony of commuters, a tanker accident has killed a female at Mile 2, near Nigerian Army Signal Barracks. Prompt response of the Lagos State Management Agency (LASEMA) Response Team could not save the woman trapped in the fallen tanker laden with 55,000 litres of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS). The tanker with registration number KSF 260 XY, which ran into a pothole and fell, crushed an unidentified female seated between the truck assistant and the driver. The incident compounded the traffic situation of major roads that link Mile 2 and environs. For days now, commuting to Mile 2 from Oshodi has been problematic, due to the activities of articulated vehicles parking on both speed and service lanes of the road, especially from Fagbems to First Rainbow bus stop. Some commuters lamented that months after articulated vehicles were ejected from the road, they were back, forcing some commercial buses to drive against traffic. The fallen truck spilled its contents on the road as LASEMA deployed its equipment, including cranes, to save the situation. “The driver and his assistant fled the scene after immediately the accident,” a witness said. The Guardian gathered that LASEMA Response Team, LASEMA Response Unit, Lagos State Fire Services and Officers of the Nigerian Army were on hand to rescue the situation.
