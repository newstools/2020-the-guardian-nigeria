Ten persons have been confirmed dead from a boat mishap that occurred last Wednesday evening in Lagos, while four others are still missing. In a statement by the General Manager, Lagos State Waterways Authority, Oluwadamilola Emmanuel, an open boat carrying 19 passengers capsized at about 6.00 pm on that fateful day while navigating the waterways to Badagry from Kirikiri. He said a survivor’s account revealed that the boat captain got distracted while trying to collect fares from a passenger instead of rowing the boat and the current overturned the boat. He said the survivor had explained that at the point of the accident, most of the passengers were yet to put on their lifejackets properly. Emmanuel said the rescue effort was immediate as the boat was just a few metres away from the landing, in which they left, but only five people were rescued “A total of 19 persons were involved in the incident; five were rescued with 10 persons confirmed dead and four passengers still unaccounted for including the boat deckhand. “LASWA has apprehended the boat captain and has handed him over to marine police for further investigation and sanctions. The emergency and regulatory authorities are still on a search and rescue operation,” he said.
