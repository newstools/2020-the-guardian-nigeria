Bashir and others could face the death penalty if convicted over the Islamist-backed coup that toppled the elected government of prime minister Sadiq al-Mahdi. It is the first time in modern Arab history that the leader of a coup has been put on trial. “The trial has been adjourned to (next) Tuesday to discuss the requests made by defence counsel,” the judge said. Defence lawyers had called for the trial to be postponed on the grounds that the courtroom precautions taken against the novel coronavirus were “inadequate”. Bashir was overthrown in a palace coup in April last year following months of mass protests against his three decades of iron-fisted rule. He was detained by the army and now faces separate trials on multiple charges. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
