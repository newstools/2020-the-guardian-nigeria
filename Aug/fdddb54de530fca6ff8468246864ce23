Wife Accused Of Extra-Marital Affair Forced To Carry Husband On Shoulders As Punishment A woman has been filmed carrying her husband around on her shoulders as punishment after she was accused of having an affair by her husband. The wife was beaten every time she tried to stop or take a break from carrying her heavy load as she was paraded around the village in India. The woman was jeered at by fellow villagers and even had car tyres thrown at her in the shocking footage. The incident took place in a village in the Jhabua district, about 300 miles north of Mumbai. Police arrested seven people after the clip went viral. Five people, including the woman’s husband, were arrested on Thursday night, while two more were arrested on Friday, district superintendent of police Ashutosh Gupta said. The couple, who had been married for three years, had recently returned to the village from Gujarat, where they had both been working according to a report by The Mirror. On their return, the victim’s husband complained to his parents that she was having an affair with a man she had met in Gujarat. The ritual of carrying husbands on a “cheating” wife’s shoulders is said to be a common punishment in the area. Another video went viral in April last year of another woman carrying her husband. She was forced to carry him for allegedly marrying a man belonging to a different caste.
