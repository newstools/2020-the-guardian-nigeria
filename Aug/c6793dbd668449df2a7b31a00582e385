Boseman tragically passed away, at age 43, on Friday after a private four-year battle with stage IV colon cancer. According to Deadline, the event which was scheduled for Monday was to feature a conversation with Chadwick’s co-star Viola Davis and Tony-winning director George C. Wolfe along with an exclusive first look and footage presentation. Netflix in a statement said, “We are heartbroken over today’s news of the passing of Chadwick Boseman, a ‘true fighter’ as his family called him in their poignant tribute. This is an incredible loss. We are cancelling Monday’s preview event of Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom. Please join us in sending your thoughts to his family and loved ones.” Ted Sarandos, Netflix Co-CEO and Chief Content Officer, said: “Chadwick was a superhero on screen and in life, and it’s impossible to imagine working at the level he has while valiantly battling his illness. His legacy as a person and an artist will inspire millions. Our thoughts and prayers are with him and his family during this difficult time.” The film based on the 1982 August Wilson play follows “The Mother of Blues”, played by Fences Oscar winner Viola Davis, who contends with her ambitious horn player and the white management determined to control her in Chicago 1927.

The film also stars Colman Domingo, Glynn Turman, Michael Potts, Taylour Paige and Dusan Brown co-star alongside Grammy winner Branford Marsalis’ score. Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom marked the first time Chadwick worked with his mentor Denzel Washington, who produced the film and famously paid for his summer acting program at the British Academy of Dramatic Acting in Oxford. Boseman died on August 28, 2020, after privately dealing with colon cancer for four years. He had never spoken publicly about his cancer diagnosis. During treatment, involving multiple surgeries and chemotherapy, he continued to work and completed production for several films, including Marshall, Da 5 Bloods, Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom, and others.
