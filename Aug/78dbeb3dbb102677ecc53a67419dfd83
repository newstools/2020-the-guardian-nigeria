Germany holds the rotating presidency of the EU. Seibert called the mass demonstrations against this month’s disputed presidential election “impressive” and “moving” and urged an immediate end to violent reprisals and the release of “political prisoners”. “These people should know that Europe stands by them,” he said. Seibert urged a “national dialogue” between the government and opposition “to surmount the crisis”, adding that the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) could play a role with a “review of the election”. The OSCE has sent observers to Belarus since 2001 but has said it was not invited to monitor the latest presidential election.
