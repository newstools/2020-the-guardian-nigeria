After several weeks of imposing a 24-hour curfew in four local councils in Southern Kaduna, security agencies have advised Kaduna State Government to relax the curfew in the face of persisting danger of attacks and reprisals, especially in Zangon-Kataf Local Council. The decision to relax the curfew was contained in a statement signed by the Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, yesterday. It was stated that security assessments in the troubled areas also acknowledged there were promising signs of serious efforts at rapprochement between the Atyap, Hausa and Fulani communities of Zangon-Kataf Local Council. “As efforts to diminish perils to communities and promote peace continue, the Kaduna State Government has accepted the recommendation to relax the curfew in Kauru and Zangon-Kataf local councils. Curfew hours will now be from 6pm to 6am, effective from Saturday August 22, 2020”, the statement read. “This decision completes the relaxation of the 24-hour curfew imposed from June 11, 2020 to contain security challenges initially in Kauru and Zangon-Kataf but later extended to Kaura and Jema’a councils,” it stressed.
