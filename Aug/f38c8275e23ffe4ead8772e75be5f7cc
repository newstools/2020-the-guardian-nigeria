Getting your kids to make great strides in developing self-control is a good way to learn to manage their impulses in appropriate ways. While older kids are beginning to understand what is and is not acceptable and can anticipate the consequences of their actions, toddlers can begin to be taught how to develop their self-control.
 
According to founder Early Learners Place and early childhood educator, Glory Ubah, it is important to set and enforce consistent rules on your toddler. This she says will let children know what to expect, which makes them feel safe, secure and in control, which are key ingredients for social and emotional well-being.
  
Setting limits also helps toddlers learn to manage disappointment – an essential life skill. Hence, set and enforce clear and consistent limits. Daily life provides active toddlers with many opportunities to cope with challenges, negotiate, problem-solve, lose control and regain it. Though it’s natural to dread those moments your toddler ‘loses it’ or behaves in a way that is not acceptable to you, it may help to remember that these are important learning experiences as well.
