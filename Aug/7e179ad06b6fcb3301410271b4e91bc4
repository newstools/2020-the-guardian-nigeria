Miss Oyiri Egwu Okoche, a mother of three, who hails from Amaisu, Afikpo North Local Government, that was rescued from Lagos State recently, has been given automatic employment by Ebonyi State. The attention of Governor David Umahi was brought to the disturbing video clip of the woman and her three children on social media, after a Lagosian posted a video clip of them suffering and roaming the streets of Lagos without help. Umahi quickly directed that the woman and her children be swiftly rescued and brought to the state. The Caretaker Chairman, Afiko North Local Government, Hon. Mrs. Amauche Godwin Otunta, told newsmen that an accommodation had been provided for the woman at the local government’s lodge, as part of series of efforts towards rehabilitating her and her children, as directed by the governor. She noted that the woman is from her local government, and that the video clip of her and her children on Internet, roaming the streets of Lagos got the governor’s attention, who immediately directed and dispatched a delegation to Lagos to rescue them. She commended the Governor for his quick intervention, promising to ensure that the woman and her children are properly rehabilitated and reintegrated into the society. Speaking to newsmen, the visibly elated woman, who was full of gratitude to Umahi, narrated how a man, by name Idowu Shittu, from Abeokuta in Ogun State, maltreated her for 16 years in the name of marriage and later abandoned her and her children to suffer in Lagos.
