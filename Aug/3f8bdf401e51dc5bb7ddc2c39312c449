…Says country lost N120b operating idle facilities The Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE), has urged economic managers to sell Idle refineries to private sector operators to meet Nigeria’s oil and gas needs.
  
According to the Chairman, SPE, Joe Nwakwue, keeping refineries idle is not in the interest of the economy, as the nation continues to incur expenses even when they are idle.
  
He added that going by the yearly report published by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), showed that the country Nigeria lost about N120 billion operating the idle refineries over the years.  “It is time to fine-tune it for better outcomes. We should do whatever is possible to make sure that we do not just give people assets, but assets that they can profitably develop. Our vision is to see local companies that have developed assets are adding to the national outputs employing people creating economic activities,” he said. He pointed out that Nigeria has failed to diversify the oil and gas sector by selling primary commodities, which he said does not maximize value addition for the country. “If we had diversified the sector, our story would have been different. If we tell ourselves now that five years from now, Nigeria will no longer export crude, but refined products. To me I believe this is achievable. We must add value to our commodities and when we do that, we are better off for it,” he said. He also called on the federal government to fully deregulate the market to achieve full potential of the oil and gas industry, saying: “When there is price control, people will not feel free to invest and yet we want private capital to come into this space. Those are clear challenges from the policy side that the government needs to address.” He argued that the Covid-19 pandemic has brought about a reduction in demand for Nigeria’s major foreign exchange earner, as reduced demand resulted in low prices leading to loss of jobs. “The impact on petroleum engineering as a whole is huge and negative. It is a tough period we are in, and things are not looking rosy,” he noted. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
