 Muhammad Inuwa Yahaya  At a scheduled inspection of the uncompleted Mega Park embarked upon in 2012 by the Dankwambo administration, the governor said the site of the park not only reduced its relevance to commuters but “has caused environmental disrepair” to the College of Education. His words: “Water passing through this building has caused a lot of havoc to the College of Education, that school is very dear to us; as at today, it accommodates about 10,000 students.” The governor lamented that the edifice estimated to gulp N6.2 billion in 2012 would have been completed in 2014, but “because of the lackadaisical attitude of the last administration, they started and abandoned it. “Today, N2.8 billion has been paid, and there are certified works worth N420million. “About N3 billion is wasted; it has been unutilised and has caused havoc to the environment. We will hold whoever decided to put up these structures responsible and liable for whatever happens to us.” While directing the contractors and consultants back to site, Yahaya noted: “Let us all be guided by all the protocols of professional development and control, so that we can do the right thing. “Whoever sees this knows there was a deceitful intention, without a single structure that will allow it function. It is left for people to judge who does what or takes responsibility. But we will complete it to show our seriousness and commitment that we shall charge whosoever started this and abandoned it and make him liable for his misdeeds to the people of Gombe,” he vowed.
