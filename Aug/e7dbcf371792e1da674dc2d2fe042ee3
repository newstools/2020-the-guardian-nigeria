Chairman, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Caretaker Committee in the South-West Zone, Mr. Dayo Ogungbenro, has dismissed insinuations in some quarters that some governors elected on the platform of the party are supporting the candidate of the Zenith Labour Party (ZLP), Mr. Agboola Ajayi, in the forthcoming governorship election in Ondo State. In a statement yesterday, Ogungbenro challenged the authors of what he called misleading reports to provide evidence that any PDP governor was backing Ajayi for the Ondo top job. He said: “PDP will never work with any politician whose ambition is not grounded in reality. It is a mark of hypocrisy for those who could not abide by the result of a demonstrably free and fair governorship primary to be planting fake news in the media, suggesting that they are being sponsored by PDP governors in other states.” Ogungbenro, who stated that when Ajayi came calling, the PDP opened its door to him thinking that he would add value not knowing that he was a sly and desperate politician, said: “Ajayi had spent barely five weeks in the party before he jumped ship. PDP governors would never support such a character, which betrayed the confidence reposed in him. “We broke rules to accommodate him and gave him delegates so that he could have a sense of belonging, but it has become clear that those kind gestures have given him a false sense of political importance. “If he had genuine intentions, he would have stayed put after losing out in a free and fair primary. Throwing around the names of PDP governors as being purportedly behind such a sinking candidate is an affront not only on our party but also on the Ondo electorate.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
