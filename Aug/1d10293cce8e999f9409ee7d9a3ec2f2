Stanbic IBTC Blue Women Network (BWN), a network of female employees of the Stanbic IBTC Group, has donated food items and provisions to orphanages in locations across Nigeria through its Blue Women Giving Back Initiative.
 
The BWN was inaugurated five years ago and part of its mandate is to provide support to the disadvantaged, hence, the creation of the initiative.
 
BWN members made voluntary cash donations which were used in purchasing food items and essential provisions for various motherless babies’ homes. The items were distributed in four orphanages: Port Harcourt Children’s Home; Karu Home Orphanage in Abuja; Motherless Babies Home, Lekki and Little Saints Orphanage, Lagos.
