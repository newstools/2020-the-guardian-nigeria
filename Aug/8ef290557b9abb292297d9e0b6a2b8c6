Mother of one of the two boys allegedly killed by a Divisional Police Officer (DPO) in Bauchi State over stolen chickens has said the lifeless body of his son was returned to her in a police van.
 
The distressed mother, Hajara Ismail, who expressed her grief at the NUJ secretariat on how her son, Ibrahim Kampanlala, died, said: “The policeman who brought my dead son took him from the car and dumped him on the ground. He fell on his neck. By that time, unknown to us, he had already died.”
 
She narrated further: “I don’t know what my son did to the police. When the police came, they entered our house and asked some boys to carry him and they asked them to dump him for me inside the house.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
