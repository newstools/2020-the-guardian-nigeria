The relief fund was made up of $1 million from FIFA’s support for restarting the football season; $500,0000 from FIFA’s grant for women’s football; $300,000 of CAF support to member associations and $200,000 from sponsors of the Nigerian FA. The beneficiary leagues are the Nigeria Professional Football League, Nigeria National League, Nigeria Women’s Football League and the Nigeria Nationwide League. The Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) was suspended in March because of the coronavirus pandemic. Football has yet to resume in a bid to curtail the spread of the disease which has infected nearly 47,000 and killed almost 1,000 people in the country. The new football season is tentatively scheduled to start by October. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
