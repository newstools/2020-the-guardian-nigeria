The Okumagba-led Super Eagles Supporters Club will get $9,650,00 in the COVID-19 palliative package announced by the NFF on Tuesday. “We have a smooth working relationship with the NFF even before now,” he said. “But this gesture will further enhance the cordial working relationship between the NFF, our members and other stakeholders.	“I am really thrilled with the way and manner the board captured all stakeholders in Nigerian football in this COVID-19 relief fund package. This is how quality leadership should be. I urged other Nigerians to take a cue from what the NFF just did,” he stated. Okumagba revealed that the club has supported over 100 of its indigent members financially to cushion the hardship they faced during the lockdown ordered by the Federal Government. “We actually took several steps by providing some relief funds and materials for our members through our various states’ chairmen. One major effect of this gesture by the NFF is that the COVID-19 relief package has doused the brewing tensions in the football community. A majority of the stakeholders have seen the difference in leadership. We will ensure that all our members benefit from it,” Okumagba stated.
