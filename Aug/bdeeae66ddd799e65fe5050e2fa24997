 [FILES] China is a vast industrial society. It is the world’s leading factory, milling anything and everything. Photo: LEDGERINSIGHTS  Here are two lifeboats adrift the sea to nowhere. The first boat is rickety, yet packaged to the brim. Without a real captain in the saddle, a committee of mediocre sees to its affairs. So its misery gets bigger in size and a disaster waiting to happen. Its passengers are famished, poor, disease-ridden and restive. Chaos caused many to fall overboard to become flotsams.
  
The second boat is everything in contrast. It is well decked, stocked, built to last, well maintained, and has a safe number of passengers with certified captains too. The only worry is the daily agony from the other side. Half of the occupants made case for helping the poor that are swimming in their direction. They align with the Christian ideal of being brothers’ keepers. They thought of parting with food, medical supplies, and even bringing them onboard. But the other half thought otherwise.
