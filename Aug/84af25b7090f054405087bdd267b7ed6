• Our workers are still the best paid, says management Union of pilots and engineers yesterday, made good its threat to picket Bristow Helicopters’ operations nationwide over disagreements on wages, the applicable rate of exchange and other alleged infractions.
  
The workers, who insisted on the review of N345 to N355/$1 in the pay package, met denial of the management, with the latter citing harsh operational and economic realities in the COVID-19 era.
 
The workers, under the aegis of National Association of Aircraft Pilots and Engineers (NAAPE), had lately engaged the management over diverse welfare issues. The grey areas include the management’s proposal to suspend negotiation on Condition of Service (COS), alleged subversion of established terms of agreement with the workers, refusal to train qualified persons for Airline Transport Pilot Licence (ATPL), and failure to fully reimburse individuals who have successfully completed their ATPL through self-sponsorship.  “In the 2019 Agreement, the parties agreed on the relevant exchange rate at which the salaries of Bristow Pilots and Engineers would be calculated. In the agreement, both parties agreed on N345/$1, at a time when the CBN exchange rate was N306/$1, with a provision for adjustment if the NAFEX rate moves in either direction by 20 per cent or more.
  
“Currently, the NAFEX rate has not reached the agreed threshold. Bristow has fully complied with the provisions of the agreement with NAAPE. By its demand, NAAPE is seeking to act contrary to the legally binding agreement it signed voluntarily,” the statement read in part.
