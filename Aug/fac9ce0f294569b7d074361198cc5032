The Women Commission said it is also working with the National Assembly and Ministry of Labour and Employment for Nigeria to ratify the International Labour Organisation (ILO) Convention (C) 190 seeking to end violence and harassment in the workplace.  “On breaking culture of silence, immediately a sexual assault occurs, the first thing to do is to go to a medical facility to receive medical attention, and when we are able to collect evidence and samples for DNA, we start solving cases using forensic, to avoid cases of he said.” 
   
She talked about the impact of domestic violence on the survivors, how to recognise signs domestic violence, how to reduce child abuse, how to handle sexual abuse and what the law says in handling issues of such among others.
