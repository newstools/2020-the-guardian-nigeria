The Director, Enforcement, PCN, Stephen Esumobi, yesterday, said in Ilorin: “At the end of the exercise, a total of 687 premises, comprising 98 pharmacies and 589 patent medicine stores, were visited. A total of 499 premises were sealed for various offences. “Some of them included operating without registration with PCN; failure to renew premises licence; dispensing ethical products without the supervision of a pharmacist; poor storage and sanitary conditions, among others, while 12 pharmacies and patent medicine shops were issued compliance directives.” He, however, expressed delight that some of the operators of the sealed premises were complying with relevant regulatory requirements for registration and operation of such premises. He added: “the facilities that fulfil conditions for registration as Patent Medicine Shops will be registered and their owners will be trained on how to handle simple household medicines at the PCN orientation programme. Subsequently, they will undergo a continuous education programme every two years.” He urged the public to buy their medicines from licensed patent and propriety medicine vendors’ shops, noting that the recommendation was a vital component that could be used to flatten the curve of COVID-19 pandemic.
