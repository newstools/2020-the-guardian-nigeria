The police command in Kano State, yesterday, rescued another man who was allegedly placed in solitary confinement by his father for 15 years in the state. The victim, Ibrahim Lawan, aged 35, of Sheka Unguwar Fulani in Kumbtso Local Government area of the state, was kept in isolation in his father’s house for reasons not yet ascertained. A few minutes’ video clip showing how the physically deformed Ibrahim was evacuated by a medical team of security operatives accompanied by armed officers from an untidy vicinity has since gone viral on social media, generating public outcry. When contacted, the command’s spokesperson, DSP Abdullahi Haruna, confirmed the development but declined revealing further details of the operation, which he insisted was still under investigation. He concluded that the victim has been taken to hospital. “What I can confirm is that the Operation Puff Adder team of the Inspector General of Police rescued one Ibrahim Lawan in his father’s house. The matter is still under investigation and I will brief the media on the matter at an appropriate time,” he said. The PPRO refused to comment on whether the operation was led by the Commissioner of Police, Habu Sani or the father of the victim is a chief imam. Earlier, the police had rescued a 32-year-old Ahmad Aliyu of Farawa Quarters in the state after seven years of confinement by his father. The police said Ahmad’s father claimed he carried out the act because of his son’s drug addiction.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
