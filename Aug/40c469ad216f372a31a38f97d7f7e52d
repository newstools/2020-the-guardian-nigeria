A 37-year-old national of Benin Republic, Gbese Peter, has been arrested by operatives of Ogun State Police Command for defrauding a couple, Mr and Mrs Bamigboye Alao, of N5 million under the pretense of helping them to overcome their spiritual problems and shielding their children from untimely death.
 
The suspect was arrested following a complaint lodged at Sabo Police Station by Mrs Bamigboye, who reported that she and her husband met the suspect about five years ago when he started discussing with them about a serious calamity awaiting them and their children if an urgent spiritual step was not taken.
 
Out of fear of the unknown, they agreed to embark on the said spiritual journey and he took them to the Republic of Benin, where he gave them a wooden coffin, which he instructed them not to open until he asked them to do so.
