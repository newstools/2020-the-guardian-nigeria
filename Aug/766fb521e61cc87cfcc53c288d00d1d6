The manipulators behind the page ride on the popularity and integrity of The Guardian Nigeria to perpetuate its agenda and as well post propaganda content against the Nigerian government. A recent post on the fake page headlined “Arrest Nnamdi Kanu And IPOB Now To avoid destruction In Nigeria – Tony Nnadi Tells Buhari Government” has since been reported to Facebook by The Guardian and action has been taken already. But unfortunately, the screenshots from the post are still being circulated by some people. The Guardian Nigeria will like to emphatically state that it does not have any affiliation with the fake page and the post was never at any point published on its platform. While the fake Facebook page is named Guardian Nigerian Newspaper, the authentic page is Guardian Nigeria with over 800,000 followers. All the Guardian Nigeria social media pages – Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram – have been verified and have the blue verification badges.
