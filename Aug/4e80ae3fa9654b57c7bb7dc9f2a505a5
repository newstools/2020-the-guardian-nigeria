Ahead of Imo North (Okigwe Zone) senatorial bye-election billed for October 31, the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state has adopted direct mode of primaries for the election of its candidate for the poll. The decision which was reached after the party’s stakeholders meeting held in Owerri, Monday, according to the state chairman, Daniel Nwafor, “was to ensure that the most popular, credible and acceptable candidate emerges to be our flag bearer of our party.” Nwafor also advised all party members who are interested in the race to adhere strictly to the provisions of the party’s constitution, while assuring the leadership commitment to ensuring that the party gained victory in the election. Meanwhile, a journalist in the state, Kelechi Uzomah has declared interest to contest the by-election under the platform of APC. Uzomah, 35, attached to a state-based newspaper outfit, Newsbreak said his intention to join the race was to give voice to youths and to offer effective representation to his people. Speaking to newsmen shortly after consulting the party leadership in Owerri, the aspirant also petitioned the APC National Chairman, Mai Mala Buni over the deadline given for the purchase of the party’s nomination and expression of interest form. He appealed to the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the ruling party to extend the deadline by one week. APC had set Sunday, August 23, as the deadline for the purchase of the forms. He said an extension of the deadline will enable him source funds to obtain the form, adding that he was, “riding on the support of the majority of the common masses in the senatorial district” as he is not a moneybag.
