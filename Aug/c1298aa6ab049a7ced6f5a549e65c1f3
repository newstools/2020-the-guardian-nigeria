An upper Shariah Court sitting at Kofar Kudu in Kano metropolis on Wednesday sentenced one Mati Abdu to death by stoning for raping a 12=years-old girl. Abdul, 60 years old, who was arrested in 2019 for raping the girl at his Farsa Village in Tsanyawa Local Government area of the state, was found guilty and convicted by Alkali Ibrahim Sarki Yola. Yola had held the final ruling after hearing from witnesses who testified the crime against the accused person. Before the alkali passed the hard verdict Abdul was afforded the opportunity to reverse his confession as provided in Shari’a laws. He, however, maintained his earlier proclamation accepting guilt of the offence as charged. The death by stoning sentence came few days after a similar Shari’a court Alkali passed a death sentence on one Sharif Aminu of Sharife quarters to death by hanging for Blasphemy of the prophet of Islam, Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). Section 282 of the penal code provides a maximum sentence of 15 years imprisonment for a convicted rapist. Penalty for rape convict under the Shari’a law can also be death by stoning, depending on the situation.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
