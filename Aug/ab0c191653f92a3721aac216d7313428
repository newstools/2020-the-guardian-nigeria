Fans of Davido, Tiwa Savage, Mayorkun and others would get to witness their favourites stars perform today at the Naira Win virtual concert. Most entertainment concerts have long since adapted to this format, in line with preventing the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. However, this would have the biggest lineup of artistes so far. The concert, which would be hosted by Comedian Bovi, is set to hold on the social media. According to Naira Win’s Director, Mr. Olusegun Edu, the event would be streamed in high definition footage. “As an innovation-driven digital platform, we are always committed to providing access and new experiences to everyone. Even though the entire world is in the midst of an unprecedented pandemic, they still want the experience of a lifetime and we are bringing that in 4K High definition, with the Nairawin e concert. It would be like having a concert in your living room, your bedroom or anywhere you choose to stream from.” He also said that the fans of the star performers will also have a chance to win cash prizes on the Naira Win Live challenge.
