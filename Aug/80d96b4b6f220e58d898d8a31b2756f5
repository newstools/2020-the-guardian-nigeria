Following  the recent positive coronavirus test by a Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) staff, the federation has decided that all officials of the body will be tested for the pandemic today at its secretariat, Sunday Dankaro House, National Stadium Complex, Abuja.
 
A statement by the federation yesterday said its General Secretary, Dr. Mohammed Sanusi, informed the staff of the decision, which he said became pertinent following the positive test of the management staff.
 
Explaining the decision further, Sanusi said, “Apart from him testing positive, I also had issues and had to go for tests when I was feeling ill and uncomfortable. But the truth is most of us have had contact with one another over the days, thus it is important we do the tests. “I want to appreciate the Federal Government immensely for their efforts so far to contain the pandemic, and also officials of the Nigeria Centre for Disease and Control for agreeing to come to the NFF offices to conduct the tests. After the tests, the offices and the entire complex will be disinfected in line with the protocols of the COVID19.”
 
Sanusi also disclosed that after the tests, the offices would be closed for the disinfection process, while the staff would now start working from home. “Once the results are out, those who tested negative will immediately resume work in the secretariat, while anyone who tests positive will be required to self-isolate for the period stipulated in the COVID-19 protocols by the Federal Government,” he added.
