The project kicked off with a food drive that had such celebrities as Nigeria’s Beach Soccer Star Abu Azeez, Super Falcons defender, Onome Ebi, and entertainment entrepreneur, Ubi Franklin, helping to galvanise support for the recipients. Akhator explains that the ‘Benny A Foundation’ comprises community service and charity, with a focus on the anti-girl/child trafficking, community service to create awareness for road accidents prevention and creating basketball camps to give back to young women hopeful. She says: “The foundation was named after my late mother, who died from a tragic road accident. The initiative was birthed to reward my mother’s doggedness and commitment towards the fruition of my basketball career. “Benny A Foundation will continue in its stead to extend support to individuals across the country.” Akhator co-captained D’Tigress to its first Women’s World Cup, and will represent Nigeria at the Tokyo Olympics coming up in 2021.
