The Nigerian Petroleum Development Company (NPDC), an exploration and production subsidiary of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), has said it is targeting an additional 600 million standard cubic feet per day (mmscf/d) gas supply to the domestic market between 2023 and 2025. Managing Director, NPDC, Mr. Mansur Sambo, disclosed this in Benin City, Edo State, during a facility tour of the company’s Oredo gas handling plant. The Group Managing Director, Mr. Mele Kyari, led the tour. Speaking on the medium term projection of the company, which he said is currently the highest supplier of natural gas to the domestic market, the NPDC boss said besides the one billion standard cubic feet per day (bscf/d) it currently produces, the company would add another 600mmscf to its production portfolio in the next three to five years. Giving a breakdown of the projection, Sambo said the company’s OML 34 was expected to deliver 360mmscf/d, while OMLs 42 and 111 would deliver 120mmscf/d apiece. He stated that NPDC had revved up production in OML 111 by 2,100 barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil and 27mmscfd of gas, thereby increasing cumulative production from the acreage to 10,699bpd. Sambo, who also announced the successful drilling of Well 16 in OML 111, said the well was essentially for gas with associated crude oil, adding that the plan was for the gas plant to be fed from the well. On the gas handling facility, the NPDC boss disclosed that the Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) unit would be ready for commissioning in October.
