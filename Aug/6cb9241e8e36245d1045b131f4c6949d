As governments around the world implement strategies to boost local economies amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the Managing Director/CEO, Transcorp Hotels Plc, Dupe Olusola, has argued that investing in infrastructure development would boost domestic and international tourism in Nigeria. She said this while representing the Tourism and Hospitality Sector at the virtual Presidential Policy Dialogue, which also had in attendance Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo. She said: “We have not maximised our tourism potential as much as we should have done, and infrastructure plays a vital role in this. Developing infrastructure in the rural areas where natural land formation and fascinating tourists’ sites have found themselves is critical to the growth of the sector. “We require active participation from all stakeholders to achieve this development. The private sector needs to work with the government to develop the tourism monuments of our nation, building better infrastructure such as roads, telecommunications, and airports that can link the tourist sites, and attract both local and international tourists.” In his comments, the Vice President noted that the deepening of engagement between public and private sectors on infrastructure development is essential for jobs preservation, and modernisation of Nigeria’s economy.
