The Lagos State Chapter of All Progressives Congress (APC) has dismissed rumour that it had picked candidates for the forthcoming bye-elections for the Lagos East Senatorial District and Kosofe 2 constituency. The party’s spokesperson in Lagos, Seye Ojo, said the primary for the bye-elections would be conducted on Thursday, September 3, 2020, noting that until then, no candidates will emerge. He noted that Lagosians should disregard the news making the rounds that the party has picked the former Group Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer of Polaris Bank Limited, Mr. Tokunbo Abiru, as its consensus candidate for the Lagos East senatorial bye-election scheduled to hold on October 31 2020. Ojo added that there is no truth in the report that stakeholders, who have endorsed Abiru, include the party Governor’s Advisory Council (GAC), the state executive and some cabinet members.
