The Presidency, yesterday, faulted the planned nationwide protest by the Trade Union Congress (TUC) over President Muhammadu Buhari’s alleged “inaction on the high-level of corruption uncovered at the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), the Nigeria Social Insurance Trust Fund (NSITF) and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).” In a statement, the Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity to the President, Garba Shehu, argued that the move was “ill advised and totally uncalled for, considering that there are ongoing investigations in the cases by both the executive and legislative arms of government.” He added that “these processes must be allowed to run their full course.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
