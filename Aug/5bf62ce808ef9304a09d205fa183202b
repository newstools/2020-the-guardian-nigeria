Pepper Row, a sustainable luxury fashion brand from Africa, has released its SS20 Collection tagged Afrofuturism. The brand’s aesthetics explores the world of forms and colours which come through in the clothes made “for spicy people.” This collection imagines a utopian future through an African lens. A future where African influences in fashion, arts, culture, music, literature, and others abound in the world. Pepper Row SS20 Collection According to the Creative Director, Omafume Niemogha, the brand worked with artisanal craftsmen—as they do all their collections. Asooke fabric dominates the collection. They were handwoven by artisans in a small community in Kwara State, Nigeria. Organic cotton and silks, drawn on and dyed by hand, were used. Adire African prints were used, as seen on the kimono and trouser set and shirt paired with silk and scrap leather. The silhouette of the collection threads the fine line between soft and hard; airy and structured. The colours range from soft pastels to dark tones. This collection produced zero-scrap waste that would otherwise end up in landfills as plastics and non-biodegradable material never go away. Scrap fabric generated during production was repurposed and reinforced as seen on the abstract wiggle skirt. Swipe to pieces from the collection
