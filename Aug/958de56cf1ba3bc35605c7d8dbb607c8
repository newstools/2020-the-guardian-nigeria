A 32-year-old man Ahmad Aliyu, who was kept in solitary confinement in his parents home for seven years, has been rescued. Police spokesperson DSP Abdullahi Haruna confirmed the rescued of Aliyu, a resident of Farawa Babban Layi in Mariri quarters, Kumbotso local government area of the state. Ahmad lost his physical strength and was emaciated when he was rescued. Police said it was already investigating the reason for his confinement. Aliyu was subjected to indefinite home arrest by his father and stepmother after they (parents) discovered his addiction to an illicit substance, The Guardian learnt. It was gathered that a human right group had discovered the precarious condition of Aliyu at his Farawa quarters and alerted the police who subsequently effected Aliyu’s rescue. A video clip showing how Aliyu was evacuated by the police from his home had since circulated on social media. A human right activist Shehu Ibrahim told The Guardian that Aliyu was locked by his parents on the suspicion that he had started smoking and was using drugs. “We discovered that the father and his stepmother lock him up for several years,” Ibrahim said. “When we got the wind of this we quickly inform the police. Even when the police get to that house the parents still denied Aliyu was not at home until thorough search was carried out and Aliyu was rescued from his cage. “We learnt his parents will not feed him and Aliyu would sometime spend days without food and water such that he would have to eat his faeces and drink urine.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
