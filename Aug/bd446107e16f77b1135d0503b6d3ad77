The first and longest served Bishop of the Anglican Diocese of Abuja (1989 – 2010) and a retired Primate of the Church of Nigeria (Anglican Communion), Most Rev. Peter Akinola has called on the clergy and laity of the Diocese of Abuja to support the incumbent Bishop of Abuja and current Primate of the Church of Nigeria (Anglican Communion), Most Rev. Henry Ndukuba. He said this while delivering his goodwill message via Zoom, to celebrate the First Session of the 11th Synod of the Diocese Abuja, with Ndukuba, who held his Synod since he became Primate. The Synod, held at St. James Church, Asokoro, Abuja from July 23 to 26, 2020. The retired Primate, whose admonition came 11 years after his retirement and withdrawal from Abuja, noted that Primate Ndukuba would be new in Abuja, but not new in the ministry. Attesting his closeness with Ndukuba, Akinola said he knew the new Primate very well and served with him for a long time. He described him as a man, who visibly loves God and very diligent in his duty and service to God. Archbishop Akinola, who was the pioneer Missioner to Abuja and the founding Bishop of the Diocese of Abuja, expressed gratitude to God, saying that the small seed sown in the land of Federal Capital Territory (FCT) over 31 years ago has grown and is flourishing. He said given the missionary prowess and administrative dexterity of the new Diocesan, the Diocese would attain an unimaginable height, with the clergy and people’s support. He prayed for the successful deliberation of the synod and primate’s tenure in office. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
