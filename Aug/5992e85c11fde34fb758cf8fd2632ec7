•Want govt’s support, claim no rank rivalry
Computer engineers and scientists have made a case for the professionals in advancing the prospects of Nigeria’s digital economy.
They submitted that the merit of the digital economy is underscored by its rise to many new trends, start-up ideas, and breakthrough advancements.
  
According to stakeholders in the computer engineering and science fields, the professions make important contributions to the economy, both from direct addition to economic output from the work they do, and the contribution of the sectors in which they work. They made these observations during a webinar, themed: “The roles of Computer Engineers and Computer Scientists in a Developing Digital Economy,” organised by the Nigerian Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (NIEEE).  From his perspective, Principal Member of Technical Staff (AT&T Labs, Middletown, NJ USA) Godswill Oletu, said computer engineers and scientists are by nature problem solvers, therefore their roles and responsibilities should revolve around solving national problems.
   
For their roles to be adequate, Oletu, an engineer, said there should be good enabling laws, act and legislation; sound regulatory bodies’ policies and programs; basic educational foundation with relevant contents, and basic enabling environment and access to information.
