Having failed to meet the minimum requirement standards for production and importation, the Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON), has destroyed LPG cylinders, aluminium and galvanised roofing sheets worth over N450 million.
   
The Director, Inspectorate and Compliance Directorate, SON, Obiora Manafa, said the goods being destroyed were classified as life endangering, and unfit for consumption.  He reaffirmed SON’s commitment to leaving no stone unturned in its fight against substandard goods.
   
In his words, “We are here to destroy some substandard goods seized from some unscrupulous importers and marketers. Among goods to be destroyed include cylinders, aluminium roofing sheets, and galvanised steel roofing sheets. The goods we are destroying are the ones that failed the critical parameters and we cannot allow them to get into circulation because they are life-threatening.”
   
According to him, these goods came from different sources where some were evacuated from warehouses and intercepted on the high ways.  “We have standards for LPG which is NIS 69 and for all the valves and regulators NIS 220. The valves fitted into these cylinders must comply with NIS 220 as well as the regulators,” she stated.
   
She pointed out that some importers indulge in this nefarious act to short–change the Nigerian consumers, advising that importation of gas cylinders is not a business for all.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
