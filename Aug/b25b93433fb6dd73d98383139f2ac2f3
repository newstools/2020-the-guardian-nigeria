Chairman of Air Transport Service Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (ATSSSAN), Hassan Aliyu insisted the concession plan will force many staff on retrenchment while the future of those retired may not be assured. Aliyu cited the concession plan of Murtala Muhammad (MM2), Lagos and the defunct NEPA that failed to yield positive output but rather crippling carrier and sending retirees to early grave.
