Kanye West and Kris Jenner | Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images Kanye West has praised his mother-in-law Kris Jenner’s music taste a few weeks after he after an explosive episode on Twitter. In his latest tweet, West said: “My mother in law Kris Jenner … makes the best music playlist.” West is currently running for the office of President of the United States against his “pal” President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden. Last month, the rapper and fashion icon went on a tirade on Twitter in which he referred to Kris Jenner as ‘Kris Jong Un’, in a reference to the North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un. He alleged that Jenner and his wife were trying to force him into psychiatric treatment. “They tried to fly in with 2 doctors to 51/50 me,” the rapper said, a reference to the California welfare code that says people who may be a danger to themselves can be placed in an involuntary hold. “Kriss and Kim put out a statement without my approval … that’s not what a wife should do White supremacy,” West added. In the outburst, West also said that he was trying to divorce Kim ever since she allegedly met his fellow rapper Meek Mill at the Waldorf Hotel. In November 2018, Kardashian and Meek Mill attended a criminal justice summit. “I been trying to get divorced since Kim met with Meek at the Warldolf [sic] for ‘prison reform”, Kanye said, adding about Kris: ‘This my lady tweet of the night… Kris Jong-Un.” Three days after the outburst which Kardashian later described as “a bi-polar episode”, Kanye West apologized to her: “I would like to apologize to my wife Kim for going public with something that was a private matter. I did not cover her like she has covered me. To Kim I want to say I know I hurt you. Please forgive me. Thank you for always being there for me,” West said.
