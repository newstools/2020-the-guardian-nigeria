Fire yesterday gutted  parts of the Ile-Oodua at the palace of the Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi. It was gathered that the incident caused panic in the ancient city as the fire razed one of the buildings in the palace and destroyed properties.
 
The fire, which affected the Administrative Building, started at about 1:14p.m. and lasted for about 23 minutes. According to a source, a phone call was placed to the fire service and they responded six minutes later to extinguish the fire.  “The palace of the Ooni of Ife, Ooni Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi Ojaja II, wishes to inform the entire public that a minor fire outbreak involving a tiny part of one of the administrative buildings within the premises of the palace occurred at about 1:15p.m. on Wednesday, leaving no harm to the oldest palace in Yorubaland.
 
“The minor inferno, which lasted for about 20 minutes, was immediately put out by collective efforts of people in the palace led by the Ooni’s Chief Security, Kolawole Emmanuel, later joined by men of the fire services from the state government, Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife and Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospital, Ile-Ife.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
