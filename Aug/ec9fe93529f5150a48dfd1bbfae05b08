• It’s Supposed To Pay Its Workers  — Government Non-payment of staff salaries and take-over of Cross River Property and Investment Company (CROSPIL) building by the government has pitched the National Administrative Council (NAC) of Senior Staff Association of Statutory Corporations and Government Owned Companies (SSASCGOC) against government. 
 
The governor, in September last year, paid a surprise visit to CROSPIL, which turned out to be a quit notice to the agency, and a private building complex under construction. In addition, the workers are owed several months of unpaid salary.  “Now, government wants to put it into better use, by completing it and turning it into Microsoft and Data Academy and someone is talking about CROSPIL. In fact, the government is trying to buy the adjourning property, and it has opened up discussion with the owner to buy and join because government wants a very big facility. You know that the governor can revoke any land property for overriding public interest or on the grounds of the breach of the draft. The governor holds it in trust. Government cannot allow such buildings to lie fallow like that for rodents and criminals without being used”. CROSPIL was established in 1969 under the name Cross River State Housing Corporation by the then South Eastern State Government, Edict No 14 of 1969 and was amended by the South Eastern State Housing Corporation amended Edict 1972 and the statutory corporation amended provision Edict of 1977.
