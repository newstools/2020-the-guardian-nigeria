The institution’s Governing Council, chaired by Dr. Wale Babalakin (SAN), purportedly removed Ogundipe. 
  
In a statement by one of his lawyers, Ogundipe said: “Contrary to the falsehood being peddled by mischief makers, the National Industrial Court has never sat or conduct any proceedings in respect of the court case. No court proceedings ever took place at all and so no decision or ruling has been rendered by the court. “Indeed, upon detailed consultation with all stakeholders and supporters in and outside the university, the VC directed his lawyers to file a notice of discontinuance of the suit and this has been done on Friday (yesterday).” The statement signed by Adegboruwa, read in part: “This is to defer to the authority of the President as the Visitor of the university, as Professor Ogundipe has enough time to challenge his purported removal. “This falsehood is being spread to malign the court and blackmail the judiciary by enemies of the rule of law and due process. “The general public is, therefore, advised to discountenance these mindless fabrications as the handiwork of those who are afraid of subjecting their illegal acts to the true test of probity and to be wary of fake news being peddled in place of truth, especially as they relate to deliberate manipulation of court proceedings. “There was no time that the court sat to fix any date for the case.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
