 A man holds a phone while reading a story published on Fars News Agency’s website about the recent news of a US-brokered deal between Israel and the UAE to normalise relations, in Iran’s capital Tehran on August 14, 2020. – Iran strongly condemned the agreement, blasting it as an act of “strategic stupidity” that would only strengthen the Tehran-backed “axis of resistance”. The Israel-UAE deal marks only the third such accord the Jewish state has struck with an Arab nation, an historic shift making the Gulf state only the third Arab country to establish full diplomatic ties with the Jewish state.

Both countries are our partners,” EU foreign policy spokeswoman Nabila Massrali told reporters. “And, of course, as the EU, you know very well that we are committed to a two state solution. And we are, of course, ready to work on the resumption of the negotiations between the Israelis and the Palestinians.” The Israel-UAE agreement, announced by US President Donald Trump on Thursday, is only the third such accord Israel has struck with an Arab country, and raised the prospect of similar deals with other pro-Western Gulf states. In it, Israel pledged to suspend its planned annexation of Palestinian lands, a concession welcomed by European and some pro-Western Arab governments as a boost for hopes of peace. The European Union’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, tweeted: “Suspending annexation is positive step, plans should now be abandoned altogether. EU hopes for resumed Israeli-Palestinian negotiations on two-state solution based on international agreed parameters.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
