Managing Director, Okomu Oil Palm Plc, Dr Graham Hefer, on Sunday pledged a N3 million reward to anyone with information leading to the arrest of suspected hoodlums who killed two unarmed security personnel attached to the company. Hefer made the pledge while commiserating with surviving personnel of the firm who were protesting the killing of their colleagues by the criminals who came to steal palm fruit and rubber cup lumps from the company. The Okomu boss said the death of the security personnel was a big loss to the company and urged the protesters to volunteer useful information that would lead to the arrest of the perpetrators. Whilst commiserating with the protesters, he stated that management of Okomu would work together with their company and the security agencies until those responsible for the gruesome act are apprehended and brought to book. Earlier, a spokesperson for the protesters said they were on a peaceful protest to know the steps taken so far by the management to capture the perpetrators. They also called on the police and other security agencies to bring the criminals to book and for the government to restore law and order in the riverine areas around the Okomu River where the hoodlums hide out.
