 Nigerian Aviation Handling Company (NAHCO) Plc. Photo: INVESTOGIST  While the management claimed that the sum was a loan and due for repayment by the government, the workers said NAHCO had no legitimate claim to their benefits.
 
General Secretary of the group, Sanmi Alademoni, said the sum in question was “a golden handshake” from NAHCO to about 750 disengaged workers.
 
Alademomi said: “The issue in question is not pension, but severance packages. That is not what NAHCO paid us. Our grouse is that NAHCO wants to share in our terminal benefits given by the Federal Government, by requesting for the refund of N1.13 billion. NAHCO has no such agreement with the Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE) that was handling our matter before it was transferred to PTAD. If they do, why hasn’t NAHCO gone to court to reclaim their money?  Alademoni said the group is determined to fight what he described as “gross injustice and brazen” attempt to impoverish the downtrodden citizens of Nigeria.
