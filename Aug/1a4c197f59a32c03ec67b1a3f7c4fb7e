Former Nigeria Super Eagles captain, John Obi Mikel, has joined Championship side Stoke City as their fourth signing of the summer. Stoke City manager Michael O’Neill on Monday told the club’s official website that he was delighted to have been able to convince Mikel to come over to help their promotion push back to the Premier League having failed in that bid last season. “We’re delighted to bring John to the Club. His playing career speaks for itself and underlines his calibre as a player. “I was really impressed with him when we met for the first time and he outlined what he wants from the next phase of his career.” “We spent four hours talking and he made it clear he wants to get back into the Premier League and finish his career there and hopefully he can do that with Stoke City.” Stoke City had signed Morgan Fox, James Chester, and Steven Fletcher since the opening of the summer transfer window. Mikel, a former Chelsea midfielder joins the list of Nigerian players like Seyi Olofijana, Osaze Odemwingie, and lately Oghenekaro Etebo who have played for Stoke City in the past. The former Super Eagles captain had 370 appearances for Chelsea, winning the Premier League title twice, three FA Cups, one Champions League, and a Europa League title while at Stamford Bridge. Mikel left Chelsea in 2017 to join Chinese Super League side Tianjin Teda. He later moved to Middlesbrough on a short-term deal in January 2019, making 19 appearances. The former Nigerian captain played for Turkish Super Lig side Trabzonspor where he left after differences with the club.
