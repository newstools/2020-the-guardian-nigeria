He had just returned home from work and his body was discovered lying at the bottom of the steps leading up to his flat. Richard had another two children with his first wife Carol, and two younger children with his second wife, TV presenter Jane Wyatt, who he later split from. The star briefly left Radio Solent in 2010 following a cull of presenters but he was reinstated after a petition demanding his return.
