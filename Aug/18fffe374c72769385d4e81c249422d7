While this might be true for many, when it comes to the quality of sleep, men are at a disadvantage as a recent study has shown that women sleep much better when sleeping next to their pets than their partners. The Examination of Adult Women’s Sleep Quality study by Canisius College found most women slept better with a dog than with a cat – or another human. The study collected sleep data from 962 women from across the United States, as well as relationship and pet status. *55 per cent shared a bed with a dog *31 per cent shared a bed with a cat *57 per cent shared their bed with a partner *93 per cent owned a dog or cat “Compared with human bed partners, dogs who slept in the owner’s bed were perceived to disturb sleep less and were associated with stronger feelings of comfort and security,” the study found. “Conversely,” the study adds, “cats who slept in their owner’s bed were reported to be equally as disruptive as human partners, and were associated with weaker feelings of comfort and security than both human and dog bed partners.”
