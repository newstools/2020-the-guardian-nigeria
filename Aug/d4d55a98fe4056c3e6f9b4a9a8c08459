The former interior minister’s decision to bypass consultations with political factions had angered, among others, the powerful Islamist party Ennahdha, which has demanded a “political” government reflecting the balance of forces in parliament. But Ennahdha and other parties have also spoken of the need to approve the government to avoid dragging the already crisis-hit country into disruptive early elections. Mechichi told reporters he had decided to form a new cabinet composed of “independent expertise”, with only a few outgoing ministers included in the line-up. The 46-year-old Mechichi is the third head of government to be appointed since polls last October, which resulted in a parliament divided among deeply antagonistic blocs. The impasse further hampered a fledgeling democracy — ushered in by a revolution 10 years ago — that has since struggled with regional inequalities and a pandemic that has wiped out thousands of jobs. Ennahdha won the most seats in last year’s poll but fell far short of a majority and eventually agreed to join a coalition administration. Parliament is set to vote on Mechichi’s line-up in the next 10 days. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
