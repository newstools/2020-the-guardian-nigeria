Organised labour has charged the Federal Government to kick-start upward review of the National Minimum Wage of N30,000 monthly one year before the expiration of the current arrangement. The workers’ body said early commencement would curb industrial disharmony.Immediate past National President of the Association of Senior Civil Servants of Nigeria (ASCSN), Bobboi Kaigama, at the 4th Quadrennial Delegates Conference of the association, in Abuja, recently, said the move would create time for the tripartite committee to undergo the processes without being under pressure. He said late commencement on review of minimum wage most time end up in industrial disharmony.
He argued that it would go a long way to remove to a very large extent all the brickbats that characterised the last exercise, which almost threw the entire country into industrial upheaval.
  
The Guardian recalled that the New National Minimum Wage of N30,000 per month was a product of intense and robust negotiations by the Tripartite Committee on National Minimum Wage.
 
After extensive negotiations by the committee, comprising government, labour and the private sector, a compromise of N30,000 was arrived at for an assignment that lasted for over one year between November 2017 and April, 2019.
 
To avoid future occurrences, the organised labour has called for early commencement of the process and to determine an agreed figure which will be acceptable by the social partners. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
