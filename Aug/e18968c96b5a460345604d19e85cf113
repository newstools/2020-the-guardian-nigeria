Ahead of the forthcoming 2020/2021 NNL season, the proprietor of FC ONE Rockets Football Club, Otuekong Nse Essien, has chosen the technical crew and management team that will spearhead the affairs of the second division side. 
 
In the new technical department, Coach Emmanuel King, who was returned as Head Coach, will be assisted by Coach Itoro Xavier Attat and Olatunji Baruwa (goalkeepers’ trainer), while Uwem Linus has been named Team Coordinator. 
 
Former Golden Eaglets World Cup-winning coordinator, Suleiman Abubakar, is the new sporting director, with Barrister Linus Ukpong as Secretary, while Johnpaul Ukpong is the Media Manager. 
 
Essien, who is the Deputy Chief Whip of Akwa Ibom State House of Assembly, and Chairman Committee on Security, Youth and Sports, announced that his Eket-based outfit, which recently acquired the NNL slot of Collins Edwin SC, will be run as a business venture. 
 
“It is my dream that this club is going to be a gateway for many young players to actualize their dreams of playing football in Europe and I’m serious about this because we want to run this club as a business venture.
 
“Already, I have several links with clubs in Europe and it is my desire that no player should stay at my club for more than two seasons before moving abroad to further their careers. This is my modest dream for FC One Rockets,” he said. With the arrival of FC ONE Rockets, Akwa Ibom State football followers will have the opportunity of savouring NNL action from three teams, including  Ibom Youth FC and Vabdrezzer FC, when the new season Kicks off.
