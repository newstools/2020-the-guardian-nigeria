BBC Radio Presenter Shivani Dave Comes As Non-Binary Live On-Air Shivani used their public platform on BBC Radio Wiltshire to come out as non-binary by playing Diana Ross’ I’m Coming Out during a Pride special. The young radio star used their public platform to share the announcement during their first radio show as part of a Pride special. Shivani spoke defiantly about acceptance and admitted that they “don’t identify with being a man or woman” during the inspiring programme on Monday evening. According to Shivani: I’m sort of outside those two options – I’m just a person. Coming out is something a lot of us feel like we should do, and it isn’t just a one-time thing either. It’s something that we have to keep doing over and over and over again. Before playing a song by non-binary singer Sam Smith, Shivani spoke candidly about their own gender identity. Speaking about being non-binary, they said: For me, it just means I don’t identify with being a man or woman. I’m sort of outside those two options – I’m just a person. You know what I said about coming out over and over again? I just did it. The presence of non-binary representation in mainstream media like the BBC is virtually non-existent. In coming out so publicly I hope to show other non-binary people that they should be proud to embrace who they are. In a moving statement following their announcement, Shivani revealed that they made the decision in order to inspire others. Shivani has been openly bisexual for three years and made the incredible decision to come out as non-binary during their debut show on BBC Radio Wiltshire according to a report by the Mirror. Since coming out as non-binary, Shivani has been flooded with much praise on social media from their loyal fanbase. They will not be the first person to come out as Non-binary on a live programme, Jacob made history last year when they presented on BBC Radio One, making them the first openly non-binary presenter to ever host a show on the BBC.
