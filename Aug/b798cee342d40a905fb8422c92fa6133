Kim Kardashian Vows To Support Kanye West In 2024 Presidential Race Kim Kardashian has vowed to fully support husband Kanye West’s presidential dreams, but not until 2024. The 39-year-old reality star is said to be nearing the end of the clash with 43-year-old rap star Kanye after he made the shock announcement last month that he intends to run for President in the November 2020 US elections. Kim is said to be keen to support her husband in the 2024 elections instead and is anxious about his political dreams in the coming months according to report by The Mirror. Meanwhile, Kanye West is said to be under the belief that becoming the 46th President of the United States of America is his divine right, following weeks of chaotic behaviour and amid reports of his bipolar episodes. Kim has offered to fully support a 2024 run for president if he got help and listened to the political consultants they hired. However, Kanye seems set on what he calls ‘God’s plan’ that he becomes president. He believes it is a higher calling. On Friday, Kanye shared a ‘mood board’ relating to his presidential election bid which included an image of Jesus and the name “WEST” emblazoned across a map of America. While reports have also suggested the pair are on a crisis holiday to the Dominican Republic together. Last month, Kanye made shock claims that he has been trying to divorce his wife for the past two years. He also made some surprising claims during an election rally that he and his wife of six-years had considered aborting their eldest child when the reality star fell pregnant. The leaking of highly personal details by the star is believed to have caused a rift between the pair. While Kim has also been praised for addressing Kanye’s mental state, as she made reference to his bipolar diagnosis and hit out over: “the stigma and misconceptions about his mental health.”
