Sumoh Naing | Instagram A 23-year-old woman Su ‘Moh Moh’ Naing from Myanmar has left internet users amazed after a feature of her incredibly tiny waist was done on a popular English tabloid. Naing who is a student claims that her tiny waist circumference of 13.7 inches is linked to genetics. She has been accused of digitally editing her photos, constantly wearing a tight corset as well as having some of her ribs removed to achieve the tiny figure but she insists it is natural. However, English tabloid Mail Online, emphasizes that the woman’s waist size has never been independently verified, and mentions that her photos show signs of “editing around the waist”. “I am in a healthy disposition and keep a healthy diet so there is nothing to worry about. I don’t think there is something wrong with how I look,” the 23-year-old said. “I enjoy posing for pictures and showing off my looks. The compliments are very flattering. People agree that it is a beautiful look.” Su ‘Moh Moh’ Naing The 23-year-old’s Instagram also features a short clip of her showcasing her waist, and while definitely smaller than the average female waist, it doesn’t look as tiny as it does in some of her photos.
