By the time Edo State gubernatorial poll holds on September 19, 2020, the state would have gone on record as the first state-wide election ever held amid COVID-19 pandemic. The general impression among Nigerians is that the election is a straight fight between incumbent Governor Godwin Obaseki of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu of All Progressives Congress (APC).
   
However, beyond the two candidates and their political parties, there is a wide range of choices before the electorate in the state, especially given apprehensions over the coronavirus and election violence.
 
On top of the array of choices expected of the voters is the readiness to participate. The challenge is whether in view of threats to violence a substantial number of the potential voters with Permanent Voters’ Cards (PVC) would readily come out to cast their ballot.  Making Votes Count
ONE other weighty choice before Edo State electorate is how to ensure that their votes count after balloting. With the heavy stress on power of incumbency across the two major parties, the threat of rigging has become rife.
 
Both APC and PDP have been alleging possible resort to rigging and making accusations and counter-accusations against each other. The immediate past APC national chairman, Oshiomhole, told State House reporters that he had won many elections in the state without recourse to violence.
   
Governor Obaseki on his part urged the people to endeavor to remain at their polling booths after casting their ballot to ensure that their choice was not supplanted, claiming that his rivals want to hijack the process. 
 
In the final analysis, it would be seen whether the rhetoric preceding the election would frighten the voters or even, whether the COVID-19 protocol of physical distancing would permit voters to stay back after casting their ballot to ensure that they are counted and made to count.
