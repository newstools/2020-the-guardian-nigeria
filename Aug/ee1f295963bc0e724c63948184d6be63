Residents of Osborne Foreshore Estate, Phase II in Ikoyi, Lagos, have called on the state government to check alleged violation of construction regulations in their estate.
 
Speaking under the aegis of Osborne Foreshore Residents Association, the residents urged  government to curtail activities of some developers within the estate. The developers, according to them, were  violating various building development laws guiding physical development in the state and in the estate.
 
Chairman of the residents’ association, Chinwe Ezenwa-Mbah, alleged that the developers were acting above the law by totally disregarding the estate rules and building high-rise structures without regard to the supporting infrastructure.  “Residents were locked in for three days without the water subsiding recently,” he said, adding, “one of the drawings is for 32-unit apartments. However, the developer in charge of that particular site is said to have put up 84 units, while another, which is said to be for a five-family apartment, now has a 20-family apartment on its site.”
 
Reacting, the Commissioner for Physical Planning and Urban Development, Idris Salako, said he was aware of the infractions, affirming that the developers had been penalised by the ministry when they came to supervise the construction. He, however, did not state whether there was a follow-up to ensure that the infractions were corrected.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
