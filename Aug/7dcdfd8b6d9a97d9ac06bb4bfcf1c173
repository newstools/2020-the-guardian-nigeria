The need for Nigeria to restructure its political economy has continued to dominate national discourse since country returned to constitutional democracy. And although calls for restructuring often re-echo with varying pitches in the six geopolitical zones, it has always formed the subject of debates before and after every election cycle since 1999.
 
Surprisingly, even when attempts to restructure the country have not yielded fruit, the failure has not dampened the calls for restructuring. When national conferences held, it was either the participants could not arrive at a conclusion or that the executive failed to implement core resolutions reached during the conference.
   
Then there are those who believe that the National Assembly should use its legislative powers and privileges to amend such sections of the constitution that would promote true federalism. Yet, that has not yielded fruits, because constitution amendment committees’ outcome often end in crisis or the larger house of lawmakers rejected the sections slated for amendment.  New Thinking
The key questions of heavy dependence on the dwindling economic resources of the Federal Government by other tiers of government is said to have become the subject matter of serious concerns among some legislators, who believe that the task of making amends was not beyond the National Assembly.
 
The recent adoption of Doctrine of Necessity by the leadership of All Progressives Congress (APC) to address the intractable crisis within the party’s National Working Committee (NWC) has opened up discussions about the possibility that Nigeria could as well use such interventionist approach to solve the puzzles hindering constitutional review of those impediments.
 
Similar path was toed in 2010 when President Umaru Musa Yar’Adua embarked on what later turned out as his last medical trip overseas without handing over to his then Vice President, Dr. Goodluck Jonathan, as Acting President, thereby averting what would have been a major constitutional crisis and anarchy.
 
With these examples, and considering the prevailing dilemma in the country over restructuring, will the doctrine of necessity be a way out as obtained in 2010 and in the APC example?  “If you must collapse the 36 states into six regions, there is no way you will get the support of the National Assembly, because of competing interests. It might be easier with monolithic states in the North West geopolitical zone, where we are all Hausa-speaking people. “Even at that, I don’t see the man in Sokoto, Kebbi and even Kaduna states agreeing to collapse everything into one. The scenario is worse in heterogeneous zones like the South-South, where I am sure the competing ethnic groups will prefer the present 36 states arrangement than to be collapsed into a zone under the rule of a dominant group.”
 
Former second republic minority leader in the House of Representatives, Dr. Junaid Mohammed, warned against circumventing laid down rules to restructure the country, stressing that the doctrine of necessity couldn’t be applied on a matter as sensitive as restructuring.
 
He stated: “First and foremost, Nigerians have to be very careful about what they wish for. They have to be careful by invoking doctrine of necessity. That doctrine is not part of our constitution. It is not even part of the legal tradition and principles inherited from the British.
 
“We have to be very careful, because the situation in the APC as a party is not the same with restructuring the country. What occurred in the APC was in breach of the party’s constitution. Oshiomhole would have succeeded in court, if he had challenged NWC’s dissolution.
 
“The doctrine of necessity was applied under the Yar’ Adua regime, because there was a vacuum at the top that must be filled. Oshiomhole’s case was purely a party affair. They cannot be taken together as if they are the same issue.  “The idea of true federalism when it suits you, and then abuse it with contempt when it doesn’t favour you, is neither here nor there. Nigeria itself, let alone, its component parts were not a creation of Nigerians. It was an inheritance from the British colonial administration.
 
“If you want to invoke the doctrine of necessity, I want to see who is going to invoke that doctrine. Buhari? I haven’t seen him doing the best expected from a normal leader, who will rule a country out of crisis.
 
“Which among the crises in the economy, politics, security has he tackled successfully? And you are asking that same person to think out of the box and use the so-called doctrine of necessity to give you a new constitutional order. I think we are deceiving ourselves. We are not being sincere.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
