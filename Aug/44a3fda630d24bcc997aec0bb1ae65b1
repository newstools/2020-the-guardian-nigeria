A 45-year-old father of three, Emmanuel Eze, has committed suicide at his Umudiaka home in Nsukka Local Government Area of Enugu State.
 
The Enugu State Police Public Relations Officer, Daniel Ndukwe, who confirmed the incident, stated that officers from the Nsukka Urban Police Division had been dispatched to the scene and were currently handling the situation.
 
Eze, who hailed from Eha-Alumona, reportedly hanged himself inside an uncompleted building on Sunday night, without leaving a suicide note. It was gathered that the deceased was a revenue collector at the local government-owned livestock at Ikpa Market in Nsukka.  “It is unfortunate that my younger brother decided to commit suicide. For some time now, he had been behaving like someone who had a mental health problem. Yesterday (Sunday), he hit the younger sister with a big wood and ran away. The sister was immediately rushed to the Bishop Shanahan Hospital, Nsukka.
 
“We are surprised to discover this morning that he has hung himself in an uncompleted one-storey building near his compound. As I am talking with you, Emma’s wife is not yet aware that her husband has committed suicide, because she is the one staying with my sister in Bishop Shanahan Hospital,” he said.
