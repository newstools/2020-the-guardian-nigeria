The Convener of #EndSARS#, Mr Segun Awosanya, has urged the Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Mohammed Adamu, to make public the findings of a panel set up to investigate the extortion of a UK-based Nigerian, Mr Bankole Oni Ogunnowo, by some policemen.
 
Awosanya, a popular social media influencer and activist, on his twitter handle, made reference to Ogunnowo’s protracted case, which is yet to have a closure. The case, which involved the UK and Nigerian police forces, had been investigated and rested by the UK government, but their Nigerian counterparts have continued to ‘pussy-foot’ on the case.  “We need closure having found that this is another work of impunity. There is no way a crime of this magnitude should be swept under any proverbial carpet. We need the report in the public domain with an effort to urgently bring to book all those involved. The IG of @PoliceNG should prioritize this. #EndImpunity.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
