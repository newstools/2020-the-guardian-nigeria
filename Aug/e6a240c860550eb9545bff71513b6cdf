Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom have welcomed the birth of their first child, a daughter named Daisy Dove Bloom. Perry and Bloom released a statement via UNICEF, United Nations agency responsible for providing humanitarian and developmental aid to children worldwide: “Welcome to the world, Daisy Dove Bloom! We are honoured to introduce Goodwill Ambassadors Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom’s new bundle of joy.” The singer shared a black-and-white picture of her and Bloom holding Daisy’s tiny hand.

“But we know we’re the lucky ones and not everyone can have a birthing experience as peaceful as ours was. Communities around the world are still experiencing a shortage of healthcare workers and every eleven seconds a pregnant woman or newborn dies, mostly from preventable causes. Since COVID-19 many more newborn lives are at risk because of the increased lack of access to water, soap, vaccines and medicines that prevent diseases. As parents to a newborn, this breaks our hearts, as we empathize with struggling parents now more than ever.⠀

“As UNICEF Goodwill Ambassadors, we know UNICEF is there, on the ground, doing whatever it takes to make sure every expecting mother has access to a trained health worker and access to quality healthcare. In celebration of the heart we know our daughter already has, we have set up a donation page to celebrate DDB’s arrival. By supporting them, you are supporting a safe start to life and reimagining a healthier world for every child. We hope your ♥️ can bloom with generosity.” Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom announced the gender of their firstborn back in April with a pink shaving cream in an Instagram post.
