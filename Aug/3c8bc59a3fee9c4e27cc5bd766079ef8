Director General of the Progressive Governors Forum (PGF), Dr. Salihu Lukman, has called on the Governor Mala Buni-led Caretaker/Convention Working Committee of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to raise a constitution review committee and present proposals for amendment to the party’s extraordinary national convention ahead of the 2023 general elections. In a statement titled, “The Future of Progressive Politics in Nigeria”, Lukman warned those angling for the Presidency against hijacking the structure of the ruling political grouping prior to the poll. He said those to be entrusted with the task of steering the affairs of the party at the national convention, holding before the end of the year, must be elected by duly registered members from across the federation. The DG argued that the risk of losing control of the party structures remains the dilemma confronting APC leaders. This, he contended, was responsible for the rampant political bullying rampant in Nigerian political parties. Besides, he stressed the need to consider developing proposed codes of conduct for elected and appointed officials to regulate them. Lukman submitted: “This is necessary in order to prevent situations whereby officials of the party will not abuse his/her office and conduct himself/herself in manners that could undermine the party’s commitment to the principles of public accountability or even get stretched to issues bordering on criminal conduct and the probable extension of strategies of political bullying to include the deployment of state law enforcement machineries and officials against fellow citizens and party members. “The Mai Mala Buni Caretaker/Convention Working Committee needs to be given every support within the party and by extension, patriotic Nigerians sympathetic to the APC, to be able to put the group on the part of progressive politics.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
