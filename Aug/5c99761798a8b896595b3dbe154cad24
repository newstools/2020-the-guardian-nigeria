Defending champion of the National Sports Festival, Team Delta, says it is sure of retaining its title any time the coast is clear for the event to hold. The 20th edition of the fiesta, tagged Edo 2020, which was earlier scheduled to hold between March 20 and April 3, was postponed due to the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. Though, no date has been fixed for the competition, the chairman of Delta Sports Commission, Tony Okowa, said his team would be ready to defend its title even at a very short notice. Since the return to democracy in 1999, Team Delta has dominated the NSF, winning six times in eight appearances. “The outbreak of COVID-19 has actually caused a lot of disruptions to sporting activities across the globe,” Okowa told The Guardian yesterday. “The National Sports Festival should have been over since April. We remain positive that COVID-19 will be over soon and everything, including sports, will come back to normal. If other states will be ready for the sports festival soon after our country is declared free of COVID-19, I am sure Team Delta will be too. “Team Delta has the athletes, coaches and facilities to defend our title. All we are waiting for is for COVID-19 to go away from our country so that the National Sports Festival can hold. The youths are eagerly waiting for the festival. They want to return to sporting activities. As I said, Team Delta has some of the best sporting facilities in the country, and we have capable coaches and athletes who can hold their own. As the defending champions, we have to prove to the entire world that Delta is the home of sports,” Okowa stated. Recall that Delta won the National Sports Festival at Bauchi 2000, Abuja 2004, Gateway 2006, KADA 2009, Eko 2012 and the 19th edition, Abuja 2018. The state finished second on two occasions at Edo 2002 and Garden City 2011. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
