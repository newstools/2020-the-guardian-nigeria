Documents from the governing council of University of Lagos  (UNILAG) has revealed more details of alleged financial wrongdoings that led to the removal, last week, of the Vice Chancellor, Prof. Oluwatoyin Ogundipe.
 
The council, in the document obtained yesterday, also insisted that due process was followed in removing Ogundipe from office.It added that not only was the embattled VC sacked from office for financial recklessness, his removal was also due to his inability to discharge the functions of his office as a result of infirmity of the body or mind.  “Prof. Ogundipe failed to share with Council and F&GPC management’s procurement and Tender Board activities. Ultimately things came to a head in 2018 when Council was forced to set up a Sub-Committee under one of its members, Dr. Saminu Dagari, an appointee of the Federal Government to review the university’s expenditure.  “Also, the sum of N3, 733,494.85 was spent renovating the official residence of the Chancellor, while the sum of N1, 354,290.00 was spent renovating the Pro- Chancellor’s official residence.
  
“None of this spending was brought to the knowledge of, or approved by Council in accordance with due process, the University Act and extant guidelines on Financial Regulations.  Furthermore, the former Dean of Students Affairs who served in this position before Prof. Ogundipe became Vice Chancellor has denied that this is conventional practice.
 
“ Council approved a budget in the sum of N85, 000,000.00 for the University’s 2018 convocation ceremonies based on management’s budget, proposed by the Vice Chancellor, Dr Dagari’s committee found out that Prof. Ogundipe’s management significantly exceeded this approved budget by the sum of N9, 739,977.89. In other words, without any Council approval or knowledge Prof. Ogundipe spent the sum of N94, 739,977.89 on the 2018 convocation as against the sum of N85, 000,0000.00 that Council approved.
 
“Prof. Toyin Ogundipe was given an opportunity to address these allegations. He has not denied any of these payments or spending. Rather, he has sought to justify them on the basis that he was in a position to approve these payments.”
 
The documents also showed that the embattled former vice chancellor admitted that a firm of external auditors that looked into the books of the institution did not detect any fraud.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
