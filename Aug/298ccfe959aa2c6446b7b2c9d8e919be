The duo of Ade Atoyebi and Toba Fadulu at the weekend defeated Ademola Olaniyan and Chief Segun Ogunsola by two straight sets to win the Oba Olatunde Oginni Badminton Doubles tournament. Held at the Badminton Section of the Ibadan Tennis Club (ITC) in the best of three format, the winners defied the fierce obstacles placed by their rivals to win the final game, which, according to ITC president, Prince Peter Akinyooye, was supposed to have been held on March 26, but was delayed by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Speaking at the end of the competition, Prince Akinyooye said, “Kabiyesi, Oba Olatunde Oginni, the Olodogbo1 of Odogbo Ijesa, State of Osun, is a philanthropist, a socialite, who has been a pillar of support to ITC, especially this Badminton Section. “He single-handedly sponsored this tournament, which we designed to commemorate his birthday on March 26 this year, but we had to defer it till today due to the COVID-19 pandemic.” Among the dignitaries at the event was former Green Eagles star, Dr. Felix Owolabi-Akinloye, who recalled the efforts of Oba Oginni towards the development of Shooting Stars FC and grassroots football. He said, “Oba Oginni is a good example of a youth and sports loving monarch who has used his hard earned resources to help sports, not only badminton but also football in this state,” Owolabi said.Prizes and exciting gifts were given out to winners in different categories after an exhibition match featuring the sponsor.
