Former international defender, Ifeanyi Udeze, believes that ex-national team captains, John Obi Mikel and Vincent Enyeama, have the pedigree to manage the Super Eagles in future. Reacting to Mikel’s recent move to English Championship side, Stoke City, Udeze said Mikel’s exploits and experience playing in top leagues in Europe have equipped him with the knowledge to work with the Eagles. He said Mikel and Enyeama’s contributions to Eagles’ success during their long service to the team could be transferred to the next generation of the team if the duo were given such opportunity. Udeze argued that the Eagles need ex-players, who distinguished themselves in national team assignments, to lend their experience to the coaching crew. “In my own opinion, I believe former Super Eagles players like Mikel and Enyeama need to be given the same privilege that was given to Joseph Yobo. “I see Vincent Enyeama becoming Super Eagles goalkeepers’ trainer in future, while Mikel Obi’s experience as a gifted player and leader is needed to develop the young ones. “We are in the era of using players that have given their best to the national team and club as national team coaches. Mikel and Enyeama have what it takes to be in the coaching crew of Super Eagles in future,” he said To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
