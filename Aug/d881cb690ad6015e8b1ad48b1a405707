Cardi B | Image: Etertainment Tonight Cardi B has join subscription service platform OnlyFans. The 27-year-old singer announced earlier this week that she has joined the platform which is widely popular in the adult entertainment industry, however, Cardi B has warned her fans not to get too excited as she won’t be putting her private parts for display. Cardi B said she will be using the page to share behind-the-scenes footage of her controversial music video “WAP” and “straight-up real-life content” with her devout fans. “I will be putting the BTS of the WAP music video. Not only the day of [filming the music video], but the whole process of it. The days before and me trying to rehearse. Me trying to do a f**kin’ split on a f**kin chair after I haven’t stretched out in almost a f**kin year!” She said on her Instagram page. She asked her fans the kind of content they would like to see, “We are gonna be talking about personal stuff,” she said. However, she served caveats to fans who may be excited that she has joined the platform often associated with sex workers: “No, I am not going to be showing my t***ies or my p***y or my a**. None of that stuff. You know what I’m saying? Just straight up real-life content sh*t”. She also revealed that she will be using her account to ‘address’ certain topics and that it will be a space for fans to ask her questions. “You guys be mad nosy when it comes to my life. But I am gonna be addressing certain sh*t in there. Everything I wanna f**kin’ know, ask the question and it will be a topic on my OnlyFans,” she concluded. After launching the page, Cardi B took to twitter to also announce that she would be bringing down the subscription price from the site’s default $10 dollars to $4.99. “Ummm I did not know my onlyfans was charging ten dollars …I’m bringing it down to 4.99. Ya spend too much on vinyls and my merch coming next week,” she tweeted. It appears Cardi B is yet to figure out how to properly navigate the platform as she asked her followers how to help her use the live feature. “How the f**k I go live on onlyfans? Wtfff,” she tweeted. In an update, she asked how to put up content on the platform from her phone. “How the fuvk do I post content on my onlyfans thru my phone?” She asked. “….I need a phone assistant.” OnlyFans is a content subscription service on which content creators can earn money from users who subscribe to their content.
