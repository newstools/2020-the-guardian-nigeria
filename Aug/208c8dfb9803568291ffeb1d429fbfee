Arewa Youth Council (AYC) has described Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN)â€™s threat to make Benue State ungovernable as a call for anarchy, which needs immediate security action to avert bloodletting. National President of AYC, Dogo Shagari, stated this yesterday in Makurdi during a solidarity visit on Governor Samuel Ortom. He said the group read on pages of newspapers with utter shock and total dismay the threats by Miyetti Allah to make Benue ungovernable, stressing that though it was laughable, the threat should not be taken for granted as similar threats in the past ended in bloodshed. According to him, AYC is proud of Governor Ortom and identifies with him and the peace-loving people of the state. Represented by his deputy, Benson Abounu, the governor said Benue, as an integral part of Nigeria, would continue to support the unity and overall development of the country. He explained that destruction of crops through open grazing led to the enactment of the ranching law of Benue State, stressing that the law was not meant to witch-hunt any particular group of people. The governor, who wished the leadership of AYC well, thanked the group for the solidarity visit, adding that it was heart-warming to have youths from such a formidable organisation on a peace mission.
