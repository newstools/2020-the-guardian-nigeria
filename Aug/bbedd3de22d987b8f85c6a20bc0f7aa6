El-Rufai •As MULAN calls for withdrawal of Wike, Obasanjo from summit
As ethnic and religious passions threaten the success of the annual general conference of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), the Muslim Lawyers Association of Nigeria (MULAN) has asked the association to dis-invite Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State and former President Olusegun Obasanjo. MULAN’s demand followed the withdrawal of the invitation extended to the governor of Kaduna State, Nasir El-Rufai by the NBA National Executive Council (NEC). NBA President, Mr. Paul Usoro (SAN), had asked the Muslim lawyers to nominate another northern Muslim governor in the wake of the discontentment they expressed over El-Rufai’s dis-invitation and the threat to boycott the first virtual conference to hold between August 26 and 29, 2020. Usoro had, in his message to the group, said: “NBA will be willing to have any other northern Muslim governor feature in its conference. The issue as I understand and see it is localised to El-Rufai and not northern governors and/or Muslims. I guarantee that if we have any other northern Muslim governor who is ready to be featured at the AGC, he’ll be given a slot.” But MULAN, is a statement by its General Secretary, Ismaila Alaasa, yesterday said their understanding was that the NBA did not want to allow any person tainted with disregard for rule of law to use its platform, and so wanted the same standard to apply to others slated to speak at the conference. “In this respect, our view is that former President Olusegun Obasanjo, who never had any regard for the Supreme Court or respect for citizens’ rights cannot be allowed to speak at the conference. The same brush tars Governor Nyesom Wike who has unapologetically abused the rights of citizens, including demolition of hotel or other property without a court order in Rivers State and he is not entitled to speak on our platform. “We don’t want to attach any ethnic or religious colouring to the decision of the NEC. We believe that the Technical Committee on Conference Planning (TCCP) has enough clout to get untainted persons as speakers apart from El-Rufai, Wike and Obasanjo,” the group maintained. According to MULAN, the nomination of another Northern governor as a replacement for El-Rufai will send a very wrong signal to objective observers and therefore it is not advisable. Arguing in the same line, immediate past president of MULAN, Prof. Funminiyi Adeleke, said it was unfortunate that the NBA finally succumbed to the pressure of a vocal minority in the association whose main objective was to foist a sectional, ethno-religious and political agenda on the NBA and indeed the nation at large. “This quick resort to subterfuge and propaganda by this shadowy group within the NBA has generated unreflective actions capable of tearing the association apart. “The NBA had in the past invited controversial figures including a Catholic bishop who is well known for his anti-Muslim and anti-Hausa/ Fulani rhetoric. “It is worrisome that a distinguished and highly esteemed professional association of lawyers can rob itself the opportunity to hear from all sides to enable its members have a consolidated understanding of the topic – Identity Politics in Nigeria,” he stated. Expressing worry over the unity of the Bar, Prof Adeleke said the Open Bar Initiative that championed the dis-invitation of El-Rufai did not see the reason Wike’s invitation should be cancelled for demolishing houses, mosques and declaring Rivers a Christian state in defiance of the constitution. Meanwhile, Usoro had continued to explain that there is no ethnic and religious consideration in the decision to drop El-Rufai. “I have received several messages from our members that have attributed ethnic and religious considerations to the decision. That is not correct and is very far from the truth. Neither the NBA nor NEC belongs to any religious or ethnic group. We are lawyers and professionals dedicated to the ideals and the promotion and preservation of the rule of law, and we belong to one indivisible family of the NBA.” He pointed out that neither the NBA nor NEC was set out to sit in judgment against El-Rufai and so, did not deny him a fair hearing.
