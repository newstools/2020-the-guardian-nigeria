The Premier League on Friday released the list of players with outstanding performances in the recently concluded 2019/2020 Premier League season. Premier League sides â€“ Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Manchester City had their players featured in the player of the season and best young player of the season categories. For the player of the season, Liverpoolâ€™s Trent Alexander-Arnold, Jordan Henderson and Sadio Mane, Cityâ€™s Kevin De Bryne, Southamptonâ€™s Danny Ings, Burnley goalkeeper Nick Pope and Leicester Cityâ€™s Jamie Vardy were nominated. Manchester Unitedâ€™s trio of Mason Greenwood, Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial, Aston Villaâ€™s Jack Grealish, Wolves goalkeeper Dean Henderson and Chelsea duo â€“ Mason Mount and Christian Pulisic all featured in the nomineeâ€™s list for the best young player of the season. Expectedly, some Premier League football fans have criticised the lists for the exclusion of Arsenal duo of Pierre-Emmerick Aubameyang who scored 22 goals in the Player of the Season category and in the second category, his teammate Bukayo Saka, who has been touted as one of the biggest revelations of the 2019/2020 Premier League season. Moments after the nominees for both categories were announced, fans expressed varying views for Aubameyang and particularly Sakaâ€™s exclusion from the list. Saka, a versatile academy graduate enjoyed a stunning breakthrough campaign at Arsenal as he notched 11 goals and four assists. He played at the teamâ€™s defence when injury hit the team and also featured in the Arsenal midfield and attack. Fans, who are in awe of the youngsterâ€™s performance for the season, believe he deserved a place in the young player of the season nominees list. https://t.co/OsULhZFbKB pic.twitter.com/slSSAFDvPP â€” Arsenal (@Arsenal) August 7, 2020  Jack Grealish turns 25 next month. Anthony Martial in December. Both have had great seasons but they're not young players anymore. And yes, it's a bit weird that Bukayo Saka isn't on this list. https://t.co/6eHjIITScx â€” James Benge (@jamesbenge) August 7, 2020  Ati Martial na Rashford young players ðŸ¥ºðŸ¥º.. Media just hates Arsenal. Where is Bukayo Saka? THOSE Bruno fc are 24yrs and still considered as young! Wow. â€” (finn) (@claudiowangu) August 7, 2020  Say this every year but itâ€™s ridiculous established professionals like Martial & Grealish are eligible for this. Iâ€™d create a new award for young players whoâ€™ve genuinely had a breakthrough season in the PL. Nominees would be Mount Henderson Greenwood Saka Cantwell & Ramsdale. https://t.co/9ZLOYTqwaR â€” .

How tf Martial who turns 25 by the end of the year is included in YOUNG player of the year is a joke where as 18 year old Saka isn't? â€” Jack Davenport (@jackdaven99) August 7, 2020   To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
