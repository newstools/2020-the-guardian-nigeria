Chairman, Nigerians in Diaspora Commission (NIDCOM), Abike Dabiri-Erewa, disclosed this at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA) Lagos, while receiving 95 girls from Lebanon. She said the special flights were mobilised following the order from the UAE authorities to illegal immigrants to leave within the stipulated time. The chair said many Nigerians had been contacted in the city, stating: “But not too many of them wanted to return home.” “Notwithstanding, with the permission of President Muhammadu Buhari, we will do all we can to bring those that are willing home. The quit notice by UAE is not for all Nigerians in Dubai, but those that are there illegally,” she clarified. The Lebanon returnees had recently sent a distressed call via a trending video to the Nigerian government and well-meaning citizens to hasten their repatriation. Dabiri-Erewa said another batch of 103 citizens would return from the Asian nation at the weekend. MEANWHILE, unions in the aviation industry have threatened to ground the sector over welfare and alleged systemic rot. At a meeting in Lagos yesterday, the coalition claimed that the conditions of service, minimum wage, relocation of headquarters of key parastatals to Abuja as well as unpaid allowances and COVID-19 intervention were yet to be addressed by the authorities.
