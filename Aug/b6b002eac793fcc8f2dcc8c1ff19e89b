Shayo’s  future looked bright while growing up. She studied Linguistics at the university and couldn’t wait to explore what life had in store for her. She got married to a wealthy man and became a stay home mum for nine years in order to have ample time for her three children. Shayo is 40 years of age now and decided it is time to build her career. She got a job as a Human Resource Manager but found it very difficult to cope. She always felt frustrated, overwhelmed and anxious. This led to her feeling very disappointed in herself. She felt like her life was missing something and came to me with the hope to find solution. In the days that followed, with my help she learned how to create a life filled with a deep sense of purpose, which was discovered through Emotional Intelligence. What is Emotional Mastery?
Emotional Mastery is the ability to identify, use, understand, and master emotions in positive ways to relieve stress, communicate effectively, empathise with others, overcome challenges, and defuse conflict. Why is it so important for personal and professional fulfilment?
As we know, it is not the smartest people that are the most successful or the most fulfilled in life. You probably know people who are academically brilliant and yet are socially inept and unsuccessful at work or in their personal relationships. Intellectual Intelligence (IQ) isn’t enough on its own to be successful in life. Yes, your IQ can help you get into college, but it’s your emotional mastery that will help you manage the stress and emotions when facing your final exams. When it comes to enjoying professional success and mutually rewarding personal relationships, emotional mastery matters just as much as your intellectual ability (IQ) if not more. By having a high level of emotional mastery, you’ll find it easier to build stronger relationships, create success at work, and achieve your career and personal goals. Shayo was made to understand the four attributes of emotional Intelligence, which includes: 1) Self-awareness: Recognising your own emotions and how they affect your thoughts and behaviour, knowing your strengths and weaknesses, and having self-confidence.
2) Self-management: Ability to control impulsive feelings and behaviours. Managing your emotions in healthy ways, take initiative, follow through on commitments, and adapt to changing circumstances.
3) Social awareness: Understanding the emotions, needs, and concerns of other people, pick up on emotional cues, feel comfortable socially, and recognise the power dynamics in a group or organization.
4) Relationship management: Knowing how to develop and maintain good relationships, communicate clearly, inspire and influence others, work well in a team, and manage conflict. Four areas of your life Emotional mastery can affect:
Emotional Mastery has an important impact on every part of your life. Here are four areas it can affect.
1.Your performance at work: Emotional intelligence can help you navigate the social complexities of the workplace, lead and motivate others, and excel in your career. In fact, when it comes to assessing job candidates, many companies now view emotional intelligence as being as important as technical ability and require EQ testing before hiring.
2.Your physical health: If you are unable to manage your stress levels, it can lead to serious health problems. Uncontrolled stress can raise blood pressure, suppress the immune system, increase the risk of heart attack and stroke, contribute to infertility, and speed up the ageing process. The first step to improving emotional mastery is to learn how to relieve stress.
3.Your mental health: Uncontrolled stress can also impact your mental health, making you vulnerable to anxiety and depression. If you are unable to understand and master your emotions, you’ll also be open to mood swings, while an inability to form strong relationships can leave you feeling lonely and isolated.
4.Your relationships: By understanding your emotions and how to control them, you are better able to express how you feel and understand how others are feeling. This allows you to communicate more effectively and forge stronger relationships, both at work and in your personal life. By going through this and many more exercises, we were able to change her perception towards her work, and help her to be all she was created to be “If you deliberately plan on being less than you are capable of being, then I warn you that you’ll be unhappy for the rest of your life.” – Abraham Maslow.
