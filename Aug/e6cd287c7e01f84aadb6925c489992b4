LLUIS GENE / POOL / AFP Bayern Munich yesterday in Lisbon capped their impressive season with their sixth triumph in the UEFA Champions League, beating French giants, PSG, 1-0. The final match, tipped to be full of goals, failed t o live up to the pundits’ expectations, but it served a sumptuous 90 minutes of football, decideee only by a solitary goal scored by Kingsley Coman, a Frenchman, in the 60th minute. The winger’s header was also a landmark goal as it marked the 500th time Bayern Munich have scored in the competition, joining Real Madrid and Barcelona in reaching the tally. Coman’s goal arrived via a cross from Joshua Kimmich. Until the goal came, PSG given their opponents as much as they received in the tightly-contested affair. Hansi Flick’s side are just the third team in the history of the competition to reach that mark, with Real Madrid out ahead on 567 goals and Barcelona second on 517. Bayern have been in particularly impressive form on the continent this season, having scored 19 goals in six knockout matches, while they tallied an incredible 24 in their six league games, taking their aggregate to 43. It was a nervy first half and despite the expectation of mountains of goals, the two teams went into the break scoreless. Neymar, Kylian Mbappe and Robert Lewandowski — some of the world’s most prolific forwards — all had great chances but no one could break the deadlock. There were few metres given in the second 45 and it was Coman who proved to be the match-winner thanks to his 59th-minute header against the club where he started his career.
