Some of the protesters, who were earlier arrested at Unity Fountain, were said to have been arraigned at a mobile court sitting at Eagles Square for flouting Covid-19 guidelines. Another set of protesters were also arrested at the Berger roundabouts after the protest. Although the leader of the group, Omoyele Sowore, was not physically present at the venue of the protest but a member who is a lawyer , Pelumi Jemigbesi, who addressed journalists made some demands on behalf of the group. According to Jemigbesi, the group demanded scrapping of the 1999 Constitution to pave way for Nigerians to decide a new constitution through a referendum. “The 1999 constitution is a fraudulent document,” Jemigbesi said. “Scrap it and let the people make their own constitution.” Among other demands, he also called for the abolition of tuition fees in universities and secondary schools. “Stop the killings in the country and sack all the incompetent service chiefs,” Jemigbesi said. “Stop all estimated billing by the power companies, provide pre-paid meters for free, and communities must have the right to audit the electricity bills they get, and review the licenses of all discos. “Free all political prisoners now, including El Zakzaky and his wife as well as employment for the youths.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
