Following on the exploits of mixed martial arts star, Israel Adesanya, in Australia, another Nigerian youngster, Prosper Nwoko, has taken the country’s sports by storm, this time in athletics. Nwoko recently beat all comers to win the country’s Summer Set College Athletics Meet in Queensland.He returned at the time of 10.91 seconds to pick the 100m gold at the meet to continue his dominance of the U-18 category in the country. The Queensland-based school boy sensation was also the winner of the boys’ U18 100m, as well as 200m at the 2019 Australia All Schools Championships, where he ran 10.77 (+2.4) to win the gold in the 100m race, and 21.49 seconds for the 200m. The feat has earned him scholarship from the Austrian government. “That talent has got him scholarship in a prestigious college here, which he attends. He is in grade 11 and we can’t stop thanking God. Where would I have seen money for such school?” his mother, Mrs. Joy Smart Nwoko, said. Nwoko, who turned 17 on July 7, 2020, was preparing to lead Australia to the World U-20 Athletics Championships before the outbreak of the Coronavirus pandemic led to the cancellation of the event Nwoko’s parents hail from Rivers State.
