Youth Sports Federation of Nigeria (YSFON) has congratulated former Super Eagles player, Daniel Amokachi, over his recent appointment as special assistant on sports to President Muhammadu Buhari, saying it is an appointment well deserved. Amokachi’s appointment, which took effect from August 11, was announced by Secretary to Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, last week. YSFON’s Secretary General, Patrick Okpavuehe, said in a statement at the weekend that Amokachi, a YSFON product, who participated in the body’s numerous competitions in the 80s, will employ his experience as a player and coach to give useful advice to the president on the best way to develop Nigerian sports. “We at YSFON are particularly happy that President Muhammadu Buhari found Amokachi worthy to be one of his aides and we know he will deliver on his new assignment. “It is also worthy to note that Amokachi was a YSFON product and still relates very well with our Kaduna State Chapter and we’re saying a very big thank you to Mr. President for such a well deserved appointment,” the statement said.
