According to the latest data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the CPI, which measures inflation increased by 12.82 per cent (year-on-year) in July 2020, or 0.26 per cent higher than the rate recorded in June 2020 (12.56) per cent, recording the highest level since March 2018. Similarly, the composite food index rose by 15.48 per cent in July compared to 15.18 per cent in June. The rise in the food index was caused by increases in prices of bread and cereals, potatoes, yam and other tubers, meat, fruits, oils and fats, and fish. Apart from seasonality effect typically associated with the onset of the planting season, as well as flooding in some parts of the country that must have negatively influenced the food basket, bread, biscuits, noodles, semo, and spaghetti among others are all made from wheat and Nigeria imports 90 per cent of the commodity for the production of other food items. With the foreign exchange scarcity, importers have had to source their dollars outside the official window at a higher cost to import, thus translating to higher cost of production, which is eventually transferred to the consumers. According to the 2019 Household consumption expenditure report released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), out of the N40.2 trillion on food and non-food items during the period, Nigerians spent N23 trillion on food alone, with food consumed outside the home gulping N4.59 trillion. Updated data from the World Economic Forum (WEF) showed that Nigerians spend more money on food than any other country in the world. Food takes up an astonishing 58.9% of Nigerians’ incomes. Similarly, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic had a negative effect on Nigeria households’ total income, as a high rate of households reported income loss since mid-March. About 79 per cent of households reported that their total income decreased. According to the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), data on trends in per capita income, poverty, unemployment and food inflation, affirm the position of worsening state of affairs in the country and for consumers. Similarly, the second round of the Nigeria COVID-19 National Longitudinal Phone Survey (COVID-19 NLPS) conducted in June, by the NBS, showed that although the working situation seems to be improving with the easing of lockdown, Nigerian workers and consumers are facing challenges in all sectors of the economy. According to the survey, many Nigerians have been struggling to survive, as there has not been any significant improvement in safety nets or other sources of income assistance from institutions and/or remittances.
