In a bid to further curb the spread of coronavirus in Lagos, the Lagos State Safety Commission (LSSC), at the weekend, presented and organised training for the officials of Lagos State Traffic Management Authority (LASTMA) and Lagos Neighbourhood Safety Corps (LNSC) at their headquarters in Oshodi and Arena. The Director-General, LSSC, Lanre Mojola, said it was important to sensitise the rescue operators on the need to further curb the spread, especially those dealing directly with the public, hence the training and presentation of kits. Mojola added that the pandemic could be prevented if all Lagosians, especially the rescue operators, could adhere to all the safety measures specified by the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and the Ministry of Health. He also seized the opportunity to appreciate all involved in the rescue operations, especially medical doctors and all essential and emergency workers, who continue to discharge their duties selflessly to end of the pandemic. In their remarks, the Director of Training, LASTMA, Mrs Olawunmi Regina Dada, and General Manager, Lagos Neighbourhood Safety Corps, Mr Gboyega Bajulaiye, commended the state government for organising a training programme for their officials, while assuring that the training and the kits would propel them towards improving and enhancing the quality of services rendered to the public. One of the participants, Mrs Longe Modupe, applauded the state for the initiative, noting that the training and the kits would assist them in taking care of their health and improve capacity to effectively discharge their duties.
