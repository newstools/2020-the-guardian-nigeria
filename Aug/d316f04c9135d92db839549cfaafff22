President Donald Trump on Thursday said that a vaccine may be produced ahead of the US presidential election on November 3 -- a more optimistic timeline than given by his top infectious diseases doctor. Asked by radio talk show host Geraldo Rivera whether a vaccine could come by the election, Trump said: "I think in some cases, yes, possible before. But right around that time." Trump said the vaccine would be ready "sooner than the end of the year. Could be much sooner." "We have a lot of vaccines under study by the way. We look like we're going to be really good on vaccines and therapeutics also," he said. A more careful note was sounded on Wednesday by Dr Anthony Fauci, a lead government official on the fight against the coronavirus pandemic.
