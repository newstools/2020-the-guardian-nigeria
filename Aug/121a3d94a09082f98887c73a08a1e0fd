By Michael R. Pompeo, Secretary of State  On behalf of the Government of the United States and the American people, I congratulate the Republic of the Congo and its citizens as you celebrate the 60th anniversary of your independence. As the world continues to deal with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we commend Congo’s efforts to ensure the safety of its people, and we appreciate our close cooperation in health, trade, and anti-trafficking efforts.  The United States values its enduring relationship and cooperation with your country. I wish the people of Republic of the Congo a happy national day and a year of health and success. Distributed by APO Group on behalf of U.S. Department of State.
