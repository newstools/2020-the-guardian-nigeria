The All Progressives Congress (APC) has beckoned to former Vice President Atiku Abubakar to return to the party in the spirit of reconciliation. The ruling political grouping also extended the olive branch to ex-Senate President Bukola Saraki and Sokoto State Governor Aminu Tambuwal, as well as others who defected in 2015 till date. APC said the resolve by Senator Barnabas Gemade and the immediate speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara, to return to its fold “clearly attests to the fact that the ongoing effort by the Governor Mai Mala Buni-led caretaker committee to reconcile aggrieved members and strengthen the party is yielding the desired result.” “We assure all true progressives, who left the party over whatever grievance, to return and join ongoing efforts to reposition the APC and further achieve our pro-people plans for the country,” the party’s deputy national publicity secretary, Yekini Nabena, pleaded.
