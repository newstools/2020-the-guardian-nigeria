There are many sides to the September 19, 2020 gubernatorial poll in Edo State. Chances are that the election might end up as one of the most contested and interesting gubernatorial polls in the Fourth Republic.
     
Aside the fact that the election is going to be a battle between the dominant political parties in the country since 1999, it would provide the candidates of All Progressives Congress (APC), Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu and the incumbent, Godwin Obaseki of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) ample opportunity to test their clout and popularity before Edo electorate.
 
One other aspect of the election, which could be considered unique, is that the incumbent, who some months back hoped to run on the APC platform, defected to PDP. Obaseki’s defection was due to some irreconcilable crisis between him and his predecessor, Adams Oshiomhole, a former national chairman of the party. He would now square up with Ize-Iyamu, who left the PDP to realise his governorship ambition on the platform of APC.
Changing Dynamics  Voters’ Decision
In less than seven weeks, Ize-Iyamu and Governor Obaseki will test their strength once more before the voters. First, the PDP would like to retain control of the entire South South region, as APC will not want to let go the only state it controls in the zone. In similar vein, the two political parties to have their way might likely deploy power of incumbent and federal might.
 
While Obaseki may be banking on power of incumbency to retain the governorship, the ruling APC is likely to deploy federal might to suppress the chances of the governor.
 
Most importantly, the election is also going to create room for a balance of power play in APC.  A member of APC said Oshiomhole would only stand the chance of becoming relevant both in Edo and the ruling party if Ize-Iyamu wins on September 19, otherwise it may signal the end of the former national chairman’s political career.
   
On the other hand, the echoes of Obaseki’s possible victory will resound even in APC, especially among those who felt the erstwhile national chairman’s tenure was a disaster for the party. This could also boost PDP’s chances ahead of the 2023 general elections.
 
Meanwhile, the National Leader of APC and former governor of Lagos State, Bola Tinubu, who is also an interested party to the election, is not resting on his oars to ensure victory for Ize-Iyamu. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
