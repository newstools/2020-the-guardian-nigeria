Jesus Christ upheld the permanence of God’s Word. He required inward and outward obedience to God’s Word. He, Himself, lived to “fulfil all righteousness” and inspired His disciples to “hunger and thirst after righteousness.” “I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil”. Christ came to fulfil “the law and the prophets” in its fullness. He submitted Himself to God totally and obeyed His Word perfectly. He fulfilled the commandments, statutes, types, prophecies and all the declarations in all details. From conception to crucifixion, in His incarnation, life and ministry, His work and miracles, His death, burial and resurrection, Jesus fulfilled all “the law and the prophets.” Jesus fulfilled the Scriptures by fully meeting its demands. In His life, He perfectly kept every part of God’s Word. He was perfectly righteous and did not violate the smallest part of God’s law. He was utterly flawless in His obedience and He has provided the perfect model of righteousness for us. The moral law fulfilled by Christ is still being fulfilled through His disciples. He gives grace to all who belong to Him to walk in obedience and righteousness. “The disciple is not above his master; nor the servant above his lord. It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord” (Matthew 10:24,25). If Christ, our Lord and Saviour, our Master and Perfect Example, did not come to destroy “the law and the prophets”, none of His true followers will ever attempt to destroy God’s Word by their character, conduct, doctrine, ministry or influence. Christ held God’s Word in high esteem, upheld the Scriptures as sacred and proclaimed the Word as infallible. So will every true believer regard every part and detail of God’s Word as sacred, infallible and authoritative. As Christ came to fulfil God’s written Word to the minutest detail, so must we be willing to fulfil it, that is, obey God’s Word. It is written of Christ, “Lo, I come to do Thy will, O God” (Hebrews 10:7). He, Himself, declared, “Thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness”  (Matthew 3:15). “He that saith he abideth in Him ought himself also so to walk, even as He walked” (1 John 2:6).
