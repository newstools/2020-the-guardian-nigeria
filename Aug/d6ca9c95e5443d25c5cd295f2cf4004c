Popular social media personality, Ismaila Mustapha, aka Mompha, has been rearrested by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has re-arrested over charges of money laundering. Mompha is facing charges before the Federal High Court. The Guardian learnt Mompha was re-arrested last Friday when he went to the EFCC office in Ikoyi, Lagos. He was at the office to reclaim his five wristwatches, one Apple Air pod, one iPhone 8 mobile phones and one pair of sunglasses seized from him by the anti-graft agency. Following an application by his lawyer, Mr Gboyega Oyewole (SAN), Justice Mohammed Liman on July 24 ordered the EFCC to release the items to Mompha. The judge ruled since the items were not listed as exhibits in the money laundering charges filed against Mompha, the EFCC had no justification to continue to hold onto them. He dismissed the submission by the EFCC that Mompha was still under investigation for another offence, saying there was nothing before the court to back the submission. “Failure to release the property is illegal. As of today, no charge has been file regarding the items. It is too long to withhold the applicant properties,” the judge had held. It was gathered Mompha had barely left the premises of the EFCC office in Ikoyi after collecting the items on Friday when operatives of the anti-graft agency waylaid him and returned him into custody.
