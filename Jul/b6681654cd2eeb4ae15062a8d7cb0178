Mandela Mile (https://MandelaMile.global/), the annual commemoration and global leadership challenge, will cap off international Mandela Day festivities with an online party on Sunday, 19 July 2020 from Midnight until 2:00 AM in Johannesburg, South Africa (GMT +2). Recognizing the constraints imposed by the coronavirus pandemic, the “Step Up! After Party” brings emerging leaders representing 21 countries together with activists, musicians, and influencers to celebrate the life of two great African leaders featuring an all-star Afro Nation (https://AfroNation.com/) artist lineup.  Mandela Mile Founder Shanthi Annan wished to honour and unite those thinking globally while acting locally during this time of unease and uncertainty. “Today’s generation is taking power and leading from the heart. Just as Nelson Mandela dedicated his life to dismantling systemic racism and Kofi Annan dedicated his life to peace and securing human rights, we recognize an individual responsibility to repair the world. Our “Step Up! After Party celebrates past, present and future in an immersive, festive environment.”  Afro Nation Co-Founder Smade comments: “Music has the power to unite communities across generations and backgrounds. Borders and divisions are brought down with love and joy, with Afrobeats in particular spanning the globe carrying an influence and power that can help shape a better tomorrow for all. It's important to follow in the footsteps of these two global Black leaders who fundamentally changed the world and with Mandela Mile we can take those pioneering next steps together.”  Confirmed Participants:    High Fidelity (https://www.HighFidelity.com/), which mirrors the audio experience of interacting in large crowds, will serve as the virtual concert venue for the two-hour live event. “High Fidelity’s mission is to serve humanity by building technology that helps people be together, in the most natural way possible, from anywhere in the world,” said Philip Rosedale, CEO and cofounder of High Fidelity. “Being a part of Mandela Day and this global movement for racial justice and equality is a great honor.”  Out There Media (https://www.Out-There-Media.com/) is working with Mandela Mile and it’s telco partners MTN and vodacom to run a mobile messaging campaign in Ghana and South Africa that will reach hundreds of thousands of mobile users and encourage them to take part in the event and walk a virtual mile towards a United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of their choice.
