The Nigeria  Rugby Football Federation (NRFF) has organised a leadership lecture class for players and coaches as part of efforts to keep them busy and enhance their knowledge of the latest tactics of the game in the COVID-19  pandemic era. Tagged ‘Webinar leadership sessions,’ the programme, scheduled for today by 10.00 a.m., according to the NRFF, will be hosted by Dr. Wilbur Kraak, a lecturer at the Department of Sport Science, Stellenbosch University in South Africa. Dr. Kraak has published several books on the various elements within Rugby Union and has presented his work at several summits in the various topics within rugby, ranging  from coaching to performance, laws and its effects on the sport. The session, which is an online continuous programme, the board said, is targeted at improving the psyche of rugby players and to also bring them together to express their individual challenges as regards the ongoing pandemic in their respective countries of residence. In the previous edition, Dr. Kraak specifically gave room for the players to speak on how the pandemic has affected them and their performance in the sport. He also showed how the players could project themselves into the future by stating their long-term strategic goals in the game. He highlighted that that the only way to move the game forward, as it relates to the Nigerian Rugby despite the challenges of funding, is to improve on school rugby games, clubs, universities games, as well as the national team training routine.
