This means that in some instances, cases could be allocated to the wrong sub-districts. We are working with the sub-districts to clean and verify the data and where errors are picked up locally, cases will be re-allocated to the correct areas.

We send our condolences to their family and friends at this time. Health update: I have been following the advice of my doctor and have been resting at home as much as possible. I am feeling significantly better today, and both my blood sugar levels and my temperature are down. I am still isolating at home and taking all the necessary precautions because I fall into a high risk group. It is incredibly important that if you are a diabetic, you take all measures possible to protect yourself from contracting COVID-19. The most effective way to do this is to stay home as much as possible, and to ensure that you take extra care when leaving home- including regular hand washing, wearing a mask and social distancing. If you are diabetic, it is important that you continue to take your medication, as diabetics who do not have their blood glucose controlled are at the highest risk of becoming seriously ill. If you experience symptoms, such as a sore throat, fever, cough and loss of smell or taste , it is important that you get tested. If you develop a tight chest or struggle to breathe, seek medical attention. Oxygen supply: The Western Cape is currently using approximately 29 tonnes of medical grade oxygen in our facilities daily, with the biggest consumption occurring at Tygerberg and Groote Schuur hospitals. We are currently using approximately 60 percent of the available oxygen supply, so have sufficient supply margins available in the province. Before the start of the pandemic, the Western Cape and the City of Cape Town put measures in place to ensure that the facility where medical grade oxygen is manufactured in the province is not impacted by loadshedding. It is especially important during this pandemic to ensure that production interruptions do not occur.
