Seyi Shay | Photo sourced from Within Nigeria Nigerian songstress Deborah Oluwaseyi Joshua professionally known as Seyi Shay has shared her two cents on the concept of monogamy in relationships. The “Gimme Love” crooner shared her thoughts on an episode of fellow singer Simi’s YouTube show “Stoopid Sessions.” Making a guest appearance alongside singer Seun Kuti, Seyi Shay said she is cool with her man having side chicks because a side chick poses the danger of him falling in love. She said she remains number one if he is doing his thing with other women and he doesn’t need to tell her so long as they had the conversation at the beginning.  She explained that communication is key and once the lines are very clear then everything is fine. Simi then presses if Seyi is capable of it and she responded in the affirmative. She later elaborates during the course of the show saying: “I would actually be cool with my man having ‘chicks’. I will be cool so long as they are ‘chicks’, not one. Because if he has one on the side, he is going to fall in love. But if there are ‘chicks’ and he is doing his thing, I’m his number one, clearly and in every way. He doesn’t have to tell me about it so long as we have that conversation in the beginning,” she said. The “Right Now” crooner also goes on to emphasise why parameters on how partners should conduct themselves in a relationship including expectations must be laid out from the onset. “To be honest with you, I feel like, if two people have an understanding before they enter into a relationship even I think it’s cool. I think everybody should be really clear and open with each other; are we going to be exclusive? Can you handle it? I don’t know if I can trust myself to be with one person forever, but I love you, can you handle it? I feel like communication is key from the beginning,” she added.
