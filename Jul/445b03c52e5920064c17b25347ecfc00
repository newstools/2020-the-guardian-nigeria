COACH of Rivers United Football Club, Stanley Eguma, has revealed that his club has set sight on the CAF Champions League, even as they await the Nigeria Football Federation’s (NFF) interpretation of the Point Per Game (PPG) system used to determine clubs’ positions in the 2019/2020 NPFL season. The Port Harcourt-based club and Enyimba of Aba are laying claims to the second CAF Champions League slot for 2020/2021 season following the decision of the NFF to adopt the PPG system to sort out teams on the league table. Speaking to The Guardian yesterday, Eguma said the club had already set their minds on the CAF Champions League, as they were second on the log at the time the NPFL was stopped. “This is an issue I don’t have the confidence to discuss now because the LMC was supposed to come up and straighten the matter. It is not in my position to place things in their position based on the PPG. This is a decision for the LMC and so, I cannot speak for them. “But I know that if you use PPG, definitely Rivers United should be in second position because that is the truth about the whole matter. But I am not the one now to place my team where we should be,” he said. He added: “When the league ended abruptly, Rivers United were in the second position. So, if we are to prepare for the next season’s continental championship, we should be preparing for the Champions League except LMC states otherwise,” he stated.
