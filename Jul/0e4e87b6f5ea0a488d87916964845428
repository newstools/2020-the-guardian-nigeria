Muhammadu Buhari PHOTO: Twitter President Muhammadu Buhari has warned political appointees and other government officials against using their positions to bestow undue advantage on anyone seeking government jobs and other favours, saying this is antithetical to the character of the Administration. Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, who disclosed this in a statement in Abuja on yesterday in Abuja, said the President’s repeated warning followed persistent reports of fraudsters using the business cards and purported referral letters from presidential aides and other
government officials to solicit employment, contract and other favours. He urged Ministries, Departments and Agencies to disregard any purported request from government officials aiming to confer undue advantage on anyone seeking such favours. The minister noted that the Administration has put in place a systematic and disciplined approach to ensure that the government runs smoothly for all Nigerians, whether in the area of employment or contract procurement. According to him, ”This system should be allowed to work for all Nigerians without interference,”. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
