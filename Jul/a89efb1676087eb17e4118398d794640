The Head of Service (HOS) Dr. Folasade Yemi-Esan, says the Federal Government has never approved extension of service for any public servant. Yemi-Esan stated that the clarification became necessary in view of a circular in the social media that purportedly emanated from the Office of the HOS. The Director of Communications, Olawunmi Ogunmonsule, who stated this in Abuja yesterday, warned members of the public to disregard the circular, as it did not originate from the OHOS. The statment read in part, “The letterhead used for the circular, ‘Roll-over Service for Those Due to Retire Within the COVID-19 Era in 2020’ and dated July 13, 2020 is not of the OHSF. The outline of the entire circular, from the distribution list to arrangement of the sections, including the grammar, is completely out of sync with the way and manner circulars are issued in the office.” It noted that the director overseeing the Office of the Permanent Secretary, Career Management, Office of the Head of Service at no time issued or signed any such letter. Dr. Yemi-Esan, therefore, implored public servants as well as the general public to always visit the OHOS website for accurate information. The statement stressed that information on the website include circulars issued by the office, reports on events and upcoming events, calling members of the public, especially those in the health agencies, to note and disregard the content of the circular, in order not to fall victim.
