Immediate past Chairperson of the Nigerian Women Football League (NWFL), Mrs. Dilichukwu Onyedinma, has pleaded with the Oyo State government to revive Tewo Queens Football Club, which has been moribund since the demise of its proprietor, Alhaji Tewogboye Oyewole. Onyedinma, who described the late Oyewole’s demise as an undesirable loss to Oyo State and Nigerian women football family, said the Tewo Queens’ late proprietor played a huge role in the development of women football in Nigeria. Onyedinma, who doubles as the Director of Sports at the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Sports Council and acting Executive Secretary of FCT Social Development, in her condolence message to the Oyo State Football Association and the family of the deceased, said: “Chief Tewo was a straightforward and plain-minded person with high benevolence spirit, which made his team (Tewo Queens) a force to be reckoned with from the Southwest then. His name has to be preserved by our football governing body because late Tewo used his hard-earned resources to promote women football in Nigeria.” The former Executive Committee member of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) added: “I want to appeal to the Governor Seyi Makinde-led government in Oyo State to revive Tewo Queens in memory of its late proprietor so that the pride of Oyo State in the Nigeria women football can be easily restored. “Oyo State during my time as the head of Nigeria Women’s League had two privately-owned teams, Tewo Queens and NITO Queens, representing the state in the league then.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
