A youth organisation, the National Youth Council of Nigeria, Ikorodu North Chapter (NYCN) has condemned the rape cases being witnessed in Lagos State Polytechnic (LASPOTECH), calling for speedy actions to bring the perpetrators to book. The youth group during a rally staged in front of the House of Assembly, Alausa, Ikeja, petitioned the State Government on the ongoing probe into cases of rape allegations against the Acting Rector of LASPOTEC, Mr. Olumide Metilelu. The group called for the Acting Rector to step down in order to allow an unfettered and thorough investigation of the matter by the probe panel. “It would be recalled that United Action for Democracy petitioned the Lagos State governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, over series of alleged sexual misconduct against the Acting Rector of Lagos State Polytechnic, Olumide Metilelu. “General Secretary of UAD, Kunle Wizeman Ajayi, in a letter dated June 29, 2020, demanded a reopening of the investigation into Metilelu’s previous rape allegations and urged the governor not to treat the matter with levity.” The Coordinator of NYCN, Ganiu Nurudeen expressed gratitude to wife of Lagos State Governor, Dr. Ibijoke Sanwo-Olu and the Coordinator of Domestic, Sexual and Violence Response Team (DSVRT) Lagos State, Mrs. Titilola Vivour Adeniyi, for their swift response and firm commitment in ensuring justice for the rape victims.
