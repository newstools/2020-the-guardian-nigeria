• My neighbour’s call five shops away save my live – survivor
• We picked body parts scattered around several streets – eyewitnesses
• Explosion caused by panel beater’s cabad cylinder – NEMA For residents around Isolo, Ejigbo, Oshodi and some parts of Mushin, the shattering bang that followed a gas explosion on Tuesday evening was reminiscent of the January 27, 2002 bomb blasts that rocked the Ikeja cantonment; only difference was Tuesday’s boom was once.
 
By the time terrified residents came outside, only a thick smoke wafting into the sky could quell their curiosity. After the dust had settled on the spot, the bodies of about five persons had been splattered around a gas retail shop at Inua Muhammed Street, Ajao Estate, Isolo at about 7:00p.m.
 
The Guardian gathered that the 62-year-old shop owner, Mrs. Adeyanju, popularly known as Iya Ibukun; her 32-year-old daughter, Funke; a tailor, Victor, whose shop was next to hers; the customer who came to fill his gas, Bamidele, aka Alfa; and an unidentified customer whose phone was found by responders, all died in the explosion while two cars, one tricycle, shops and surrounding buildings were not spared.  Another survivor, Emmanuel Saviour, said an oxygen gas used for panel beating and welding sold by Iya Ibukun caused the incident. “It occurred few minutes to 7p.m. The woman has already closed for the day and I had greeted her goodnight. I never knew it was goodbye.
 
“A customer named Bamidele, aka Alfa, came to fill gas. She and the Alfa were in a haste. The customer was rushing and she also was in a hurry to go home. She was already in her vehicle when her daughter came down from the car to open the shop in order to attend to the customer. I had not got far from the shop when the explosion occurred and affected my head a little.
 
“Even Victor, the tailor, whose shop is next to the gas shop, was through for the day. He only stayed back to iron the clothes he sewed after light was restored before the gas went off and unfortunately died in the explosion.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
