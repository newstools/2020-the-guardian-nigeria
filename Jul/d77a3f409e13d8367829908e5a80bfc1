• Overburdening Nigerians With Taxes, Tariffs Must Stop –  PDP
• Economic Sustainability Plan Is Step In Right Direction – Muda Yusuf As Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) continue to jolt economies across the world, Nigeria is equally battling to find the right balance between revenue drive and rising poverty occasioned by effects of the pandemic on the productive sector of the economy.
  
Stakeholders under the auspices of the Organised Private Sector (OPS) have urged the Federal Government and state governments to focus more on stimulus to aid the recovery of the productive sector, and improve household incomes rather than intensify its revenue drive from taxes.  From an increase in VAT in February to stamp duties, an adjustment in fuel price, consumers have had to deal with other soaring costs from the private sector like POS levy, USSD code levy, a levy on deposits, or withdrawal over certain thresholds and inflation. This perhaps, explains why the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has accused President Muhammadu Buhari, and his ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) of overburdening Nigerians with taxes and tariffs, stressing that the government cares less about relieving the suffering poor of their plight. With the real GDP growth of the manufacturing sector falling in the first quarter of 2020, local manufacturers have expressed worries that reduction in household incomes, occasioned by the loss of jobs and salary cuts due to the pandemic, alongside inflation, will further affect consumption and capacity to purchase goods.  He lamented that the failures of the Buhari-led administration are strangulating the nation’s economy, killing small and medium enterprises (SMEs), and causing investors’ flight to other neighbouring countries where business environments are conducive and friendly. “I find it laughable and contradictory that a regime that multiplies people’s taxes and hikes prices indiscriminately during this pandemic is talking of lifting some Nigerians out of poverty with such draconian and insensitive policies that earned the country the ignoble title of ‘poverty capital’ of the world.” Secondus listed some of the taxes that have further impoverished the people to bank charges, stamp duty by CBN, increased VAT, charges on cash deposits and withdrawals above N500, 000 for individuals and N3m for corporate accounts, as well as fuel price increase among others.
