Two Nigerian firms receive N38.7m UK grant to support families’ health emergencies A middle-aged woman, simply identified as Mrs. Oregbe has slumped and died in Ughelli, Ughelli North Local Government Area of Delta State after hearing her husband tested positive for coronavirus. It was gathered that the tragedy, which occurred at Igho Salami Street, Uloho Avenue, threw neighbours into mourning and confusion as they gathered in small groups discussing the matter in low tones and unwilling to talk about the incident to strangers. According to a source, Mrs. Oregbe was at home when the news of her husband’s sample result came out on Monday. The source stated: “I am sure she has been managing high blood pressure before now because as soon as she was told her husband tested positive she slumps and died before they could rush her to the hospital.”. Meantime, a United Kingdom group, Catalyst Fund, has announced that two Nigerian firms, WellaHealth and Flex Finance, will receive N38.7 million (£80,000) grant capital. The companies will also benefit from a six-month programme from experts of the research, advisory and data analytics firm, BFA Global. The grant is expected to assist them in the provision of affordable healthcare coverage to protect families from the financial shock that comes from unexpected health emergencies, including hospital cash during COVID-19. A statement on Wednesday from the British High Commission said the two Nigerian firms were awarded the grant alongside four other fin-tech startups from Mexico (Mango Life and Graviti), South Africa (PayMeNow) and India (KarmaLife). All six are now part of a cohort of 31 companies from around the world receiving Catalyst Fund support. The statement said Catalyst Fund has accelerated 31 firms that have gone on to raise over $64m in funding and reached over two million low-income customers.
