The Idowu Balogun family of the Idomila Ruling House in Iba area of Lagos State has appealed to kingmakers to follow the Federal High Court judgment, which conferred the ruling house equal rights and eligibility to present a candidate for the Oniba’s stool.
  
The judgment further barred the Oduntan arm of the ruling house from presenting any candidate after presenting five successive Obas in Iba town.
   
This call came following the demise of the monarch, the Oniba of Iba, Oba Goriola Yishau Oseni, who joined his ancestors on May 25, 2020.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
