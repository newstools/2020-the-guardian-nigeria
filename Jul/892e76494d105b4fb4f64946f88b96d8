The Ahmadiyya Muslim Women under the auspices of Lajna Imaillah Ahmadiyya Nigeria (LIMAN) has condemned in strongest terms the high rate of rape and gender-based violence against women and girls in Nigeria. Arising from a virtual meeting and training against rape and violence against women in Lagos, the group described the ugly development across the country as sad and unfortunate, considering the vulnerable nature of the gender and their crucial roles in the society as homemakers and mothers. According to the Sadr/ President, Lajna Imaillah Ahmadiyya Muslim Jamaat Nigeria, Hajia Taofeeqah Fagbolade,  Islam frowns at any form of violence against women and regards rape as a grievous crime under the Sharia (Islamic law). Rape, she said is referred to as “al-zinã bi al-ikrãh” by Muslim jurists and is defined as forced cohabitation by a man with a woman who is not his wife.  She cited the glorious Quran chapter 4 verse 35 where Allah (SWT) stated that men are guardians over women….’ The leader of the Ahmadiyya women noted that when you raise a female child successfully, you have raised a nation because from her would future generations be born. She canvassed for a special care for the females as “jewel and never to be regarded as an object of ridicule or molestation”.The Islamic women group urged the House of Assemblies in the states to pass the Bill on “Rape and Gender Violence”. Fagbolade admonished parents, guardians and religious leaders to join the fight against this scourge by sensitizing their children, wards and religious adherents on the negative implications of rape in terms of psychological, physical, social and lasting effects on the victims.
