Chief of Staff to Governor Babagana Zulum of Borno State, Dr. Babagana Wakil, passed on yesterday at his Maiduguri residence. The Guardian gathered that the death might not be unconnected with high blood pressure and ulcer, which he had been managing for some time. Affirming this, spokesman to governor, Isa Gusau, disclosed yesterday in Maiduguri, “The late Wakil’s death may have nothing to do with the coronavirus virus (COVID-19) because his funeral prayers are already announced to hold by 4 p.m. today (Wednesday) at his extended family residence in Shehuri North. “It is from God we come and unto him shall we return.” The last official engagement of the late Wakil was on June 1, 2020, when he represented Zulum at the foundation-laying ceremony of Army Referral Hospital.
