Founder of BewiAfrica, Ms Florence Hungbo, said the body decided to enlighten youths, especially college students, who have become entrenched in substance abuse without minding its effects. She said: “We visited the youths and leaders in Fadeyi and Ojuelegba with some entertainers and therapists to lecture the youth on dangers of drug abuse, harping on its adverse effect on how it kills dreams and derail a bright future.” For those already battling with substance abuse, Hungbo urged them to reach out to the organisation via its social media handles. The NGO also distributed food items to the youth and leaders in the two areas visited. Also, Mr Femi Akinboyeku, a transport unionist in Fadeyi, popularly known as J. Plum, condemned drug abuse. “I neither smoke nor drink. Today, I have been able to achieve so much. If I were doing drugs, I would not have been anywhere near where I have reached,” he said. In his remarks, vice chairman, Somolu Local Government Area, Bowale Sosimi, commended BewiAfrica for the outreach, which he said was first of its kind for youths of the area. In Ojuelegba, deputy chairman of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW), Aransiola Qudus, also thanked NGO for choosing Ojuelegba for the campaign.
