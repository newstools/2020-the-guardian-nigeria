The Chartered Institute of Personnel Management (CIPM), has charged organisations to build a culture alignment journey and a resilient workforce for a profitable organisation.
 
They said it became pertinent, following the business world of today that has been disrupted with the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic.
  
Guest Speaker at a virtual Human Resource (HR) Advocacy Roundtable by the CIPM, themed, “The Changing Dynamics of Work and Industrial Relations”, Henry Unuakpor, said HR professionals increasingly have the responsibility of charting the course of productivity in any organisation by engaging the workforce for optimal productivity.  At the panellist discussion, which comprised leaders in the private and public sectors, the participants were urged to always seek to know more especially in the face of uncertainties in the legal framework, and employee engagement among others.
 
In her closing remarks, the Registrar/Chief Executive Officer, CIPM, Busola Alofe, urged HR, Team Leads, and Heads of Departments on the need to care for their employees for better delivery.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
