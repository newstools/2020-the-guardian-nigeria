Lagos State Government has said traffic officers would be on duty 24 hours daily during the six months the Third Mainland Bridge will undergo repairs. The Commissioner for Transport, Federic Oladeinde, during a press briefing on Friday, said this is an effort to ensure hitch-free traffic on the bridge and on alternative routes. He said 650 Lagos State Traffic Management Authority (LASTMA) officers would be deployed to manage traffic on the bridge and alternative routes which would be complemented by 250 officers of the Federal Road Safety Corps. Oladeinde disclosed that the officers that would be deployed will operate three shifts, with each batch working for eight hours, so they don’t get overwhelmed. The commissioner implored to cooperate with traffic officers so as to have hitch-free movement. He said the closure won’t affect 75 per cent of the users as alternative routes are already in place for the 25 per cent motoring public that would be affected by the partial closure of the road. Also, the Special Adviser to the Governor on Transportation, Oluwatoyin Fayinka said LASTMA officers have been retrained for the exercise. “They are to ensure that free flow of traffic is not jeopardise,” Fayinka said. The Special Adviser to Lagos State Governor on Works, Aramide Adeyoye also said most of the alternative routes that need repair have been fixed and the ones still undergoing repair would be completed before the end of today. Adeyoye further said the repairs of Abule-Egba-Toll Gate route of the Lagos-Abeokuta Expressway is being delayed due to the procurement process.
