• Delay Threatens Dreams Of Averting Imminent Food Crisis
• Hampers Concessionaires’ Access To CBN’s Credit Facility To Mop Farm Produce About N10.4b yearly concession fee and share profit might have been lost by the Federal Government in the last one year, due to the non-release of the 19 Silo Complexes concessioned in 2019.
 
Checks revealed that the Federal Government could have earned a yearly concession fee of N3.4b and another N6b as profit share of the franchise, if the silos had been handed over to the concessionaires early. Unfortunately, the concessionaires still have about N1.3b tied down in the transaction.
  
To compound the issue, the current Minister of Agriculture, Sabo Nanono, according to the grapevine, has threatened to review the contracts, saying he would not hesitate to revoke the licence of any concessionaire that couldn’t meet the ministry’s terms of agreement.  It is, however, unfortunate that seven years after, the ministry is yet to fully put the silos to use. 
 
On May 16, 2019, the Federal Government released the silos to six agro allied companies— Agro Universal Consortium, Matriville Nigeria Ltd, Flour Mills Limited, Ebony Agro industries Ltd, Neon Farms Africa Consortium and Coscharis Farms Ltd, which won the bid, for the benefit of farmers and the nation. Upon conclusion of the transaction process, a ceremonial handover and signing of concession agreement was performed to enable the concessionaires meet the conditions before physical hand over. 
 
Part of the condition precedents include: Twenty-five per cent upfront payment to the Federal Ministry of Agriculture; payment of 75 per cent to the ministry; proof of payment of success fees to the transaction Advisers; submission of payment receipt to ICRC; submission of Performance bond for review and approval; and Submission of insurance cover for review and approval. 
 
Other conditions include proof of representation of Warranties; Certificate of Compliance; proof of no material adverse effect; proof of corporate proceedings, including letters showing board resolutions of the transaction, constituent documents of concessionaires, and letter granting authority to office of the concessionaires executing the concession agreement.  They explained that they are only waiting for the silos to be released to them, but unfortunately, the process is still being held up by government bureaucracy. 
  
One of them said: “Had the silo complexes handed over to us in good time, we would have been able to access credit facility from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to enable us mop up farm produce from farmers, so that we can return to the farm and maintain all-year-round farming cycle. Unfortunately, that has not been done.
   
“It’s a good initiative, but it has to be well implemented. Ogbeh did everything and handed over the certificate to us then. But when the new minister came on board, he wanted to go over all the documentation again. So, the delay is from this new minister.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
