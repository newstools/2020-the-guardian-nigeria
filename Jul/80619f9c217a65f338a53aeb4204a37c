Multichoice has reiterated plans to integrate Netflix and Amazon Prime Video services into its Explora decoder. The company said that the agreement to integrate the services into its Explora decoder still stands even as it announced that it has commenced field trials for its own DSTV streaming products, which will be launched later in the year. CEO Calvo Mawela stated that as long-standing content aggregators, their decision to integrate the services was proof of their aggregator model at work. Mawela said: “We have long been a content aggregator, and this is proof of our aggregator model at work – providing simplicity, choice and convenience for our customers.” Also, he said, “as our industry evolves, we believe that we are well-positioned to benefit from both worlds – a large, growing pay-TV market in Africa, as well as an emerging over-the-top opportunity, where our own OTT services and aggregation capabilities can drive success.” The South Africa-based Pay-TV operators currently provide a streaming offering, Showmax, which is also available on Explora. However, observers say their decision to integrate both Netflix and Amazon represents a significant shift in strategy to remain the leading pay-TV channel and content aggregators.
