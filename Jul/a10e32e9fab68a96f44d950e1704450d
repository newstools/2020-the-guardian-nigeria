The need for cordial relationship between the church and its host community has been emphasised by the Alayige of Orile-Agege, Oba Ambali Hakeem Agbedeyi 11, while receiving the President, Lagos West Baptist Conference, Rev. Samuel Oladiran and his delegation in his palace.
 
The monarch commended the conference for its strong focus on promoting peaceful coexistence through its teachings and doctrines. He also applauded the church for its decision to build a multi-storey secretariat within his domain and promised to support the project.
 
He said the denomination remained a strong pillar in uplifting the lives of the people through its undiluted teachings and beliefs and urged other spiritual organisations to emulate them.
 
Earlier in his remarks, Rev. Oladiran, who recently assumed his present position, underscored the need to deepen the relationship between the church and the community. He said the church has a critical role to play in nation building and in line with scriptural injunctions, the church is expected to pray for kings and those in authority.
 
The delegation included the Chairman, Lagos West Baptist Conference, Rev. Tunji Bamgbose; Rev. Sunday Okanlawon, Rev. Jacob Ajala, Rev. Totoola Oyelade and Deacon Aremu Ayedun.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
