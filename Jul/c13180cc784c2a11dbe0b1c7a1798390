Others at the hearing were the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC), the Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria (CIBN), Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Financial Correspondents Association of Nigeria (FICAN), Association of Senior Staff of Banks, Insurance & Financial Institutions (ASSBIFI), and the National Union of Banks, Insurance and Financial Institutions Employees (NUBIFE). Besides strengthening the Nigerian financial system, the bill, sponsored by Senator Uba Sani (Kaduna Central) and co-sponsored by Senator Betty Jocelyn Apiafi (Rivers West), seeks to regulate banking and businesses of other financial institutions by prohibiting the carrying on of such businesses in the country, except under licence, and by a company incorporated in Nigeria. The piece of legislation also made provision for proper licensing, supervision and revocation of licences of affected institutions by the apex bank. However, the piece of law has to be similarly passed by the House of Representatives, after which the reports will be harmonised for onward transmission to the President for assent.
