Chairman of the Alex Otti faction of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) in Abia State, Chief Nkem Okorie, has urged members who defected from the party to reconsider their decision and return to its fold. Speaking at a media briefing in Umuahia yesterday, Okorie listed some of the defected members as Alex Otti, Mrs. Bianca Emeka Ojukwu, senators Stella Oduah and Andy Uba, Frank Nneji, David Onuoha, Chris Nkwonta, Okey Eze, Humphrey Anumudu, Stanley Amuchie and Uche Onyeaguocha, among others. He said they left the party over the highhandedness of its former national leadership, alleging that the former leadership hurriedly deployed some disgruntled former State Working Committee (SWC) members to insult some of its leaders at a press conference. The APGA chief apologised to those he said were insulted and provoked leading to their exiting the party, saying APGA was formed as a platform for responsible leadership and not to defraud people “as the former national leadership did in Imo, Abia and Anambra states.” He cautioned that those strategising to use the party to defraud the people again should forget the idea, as that would not be allowed to happen again. Okoro cautioned the Augustine Ehiemere-led faction to desist from impersonating the SWC or risk severe sanctions for doing otherwise, insisting that the state party remained committed to aligning with its Acting National Chairman, Dr. Mic Adams and other progressives to reposition APGA for the challenges ahead.
