Elder statesman, Chief Edwin Clark, and the immediate past governor of Bayelsa State, Seriake Dickson, have congratulated ex-militant Niger Delta leader, Government Ekpemupolo, on his acquittal of corruption by the Federal High Court, Lagos. The court on Wednesday dismissed the  N34 billion fraud case filed by the Federal Government against Global West Vessel Specialist Limited, a firm linked to Ekpemupolo, popularly known as Tompolo.
Clark and Dickson called on the Federal Government to release the property it seized from Tompolo, his firm and co-accused following their acquittal. A statement by the media aide to Dickson, Fidelis Sorowei, said both Ijaw leaders made the call after a closed-door meeting on Thursday in Abuja. The statement said the duo also reviewed the situation in Niger Delta,  especially the growing tension among ex-agitators, and condemned the delay in appointing a substantive coordinator from the region for the Presidential Amnesty Programme. They called on the Federal Government to make the appointment without further delay. Clark and Dickson also called on the  Federal Government to implement all resolutions and agreements it reached with the Pan Niger Delta Development Forum on long-term development, security and stability of Niger Delta. The statement said: “We call on appropriate authorities to hand over the property seized from him (Tompolo) and his company. “We also reviewed developments and rising tension among ex-agitators in Niger Delta and condemned the delay in appointing the coordinator (of the PAP)  and asked for the immediate appointment of a boss for the office.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
