As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to drive tech innovations, a contact-sharing app, which main feature is to help individuals exchange phone numbers and social media handles such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitters, Linkedin and others, has made a debut. The device, launched as ‘Scosh’, is also a game-changer for the business community and professionals as it serves as a digital complementary card which completely eradicates the burden of carrying a stack of cards everywhere. Speaking in Lagos, Country Manager of Popl Nigeria, Tope Sanni, said the app is an innovative product that enables people to share their phone numbers and social media handles within seconds. “The app comes in handy and useful in sharing contacts and social media handles especially in this period of COVID-19, where we are expected to maintain social distance,” Sanni said. According to him, the app is apt because of the increasing need for social interaction among people, and especially in the period of COVID-19 where people were locked down for weeks, and maintain social distance. He also said Nigeria, Ghana, and South Africa are the three markets in Africa, where the app is gaining penetration, while also enjoying usability in South America, Europe, North America, and Asia. Explaining why the device was launched as ‘Scosh’ in Nigeria, Sanni said it was to create a brand that is targeted for and unique to the Nigerian market; as Popl has presence in many parts of the world. He said apps are the right products to drive social interaction at this time of pandemic, where personal responsibility for safety is critical. “This is basically an innovation card. We intend to break into the Nigeria market by driving huge penetration through social media. We will also use the traditional media such as newspapers and radio to create more awareness for this product,” he said.
