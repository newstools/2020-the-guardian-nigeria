Google | The Indian Express Last month, tech giant Google banned over 50 apps due to concerns that they are causing Android users to be flooded with adverts. Google has further banned 24 apps from its Play Store for the same problem, with worries that the apps were clogging phones up with annoying hardware. According to Daily Express, the latest attack targets Facebook users with stolen personal information and credentials that hackers stole from social accounts. The ban came after French cyber-security firm Evina reported its findings to Google in May. Evina discovered that the apps could infiltrate devices by offering genuine functionality. When a user installs the app, a hidden code inside it is automatically activated and begins to steal personal data. When the user launches Facebook, an overlay web browser window pops up over the Facebook app. It brings up a Facebook login page that is incredibly like the real thing. Then users enter their username and password, which are sent on to hackers. Evina found the malicious code in 24 apps, which Google removed as soon as it was reported to them at the end of May and they had verified the security company’s findings. The 24 apps are: Super Wallpapers Flashlight
