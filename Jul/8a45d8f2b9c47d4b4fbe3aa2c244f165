An Abuja-based lawyer, Oladimeji Felix Ekengba, has sued President Muhammadu Buhari, the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), and the Senate at a Federal High Court, Abuja for allegedly breaching Section 256(2) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) in the appointment of 11 judges for the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) High Court. Other respondents in the suit are the Clerk of the Senate, Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), and the National Judicial Council (NJC). In the motion on notice, the plaintiff urged the court to make an order of interim injunction restraining the respondents from screening, confirming and/or swearing in the persons as judges of the FCT High Court pending the hearing and determination of the substantive suit. The Nigerian leader had, on July 7, 2020, forwarded the nominees to the upper legislative chamber for confirmation. They include Abubakar Useni Musa, Edward Okpe, Jude Nwabueze, Josephine Enobi, and Christopher Opeyemi. Others are Mohammed Idris, Hassan Maryam Aliyu, Fashola Akeem Adebowale, B. Abubakar, M.
