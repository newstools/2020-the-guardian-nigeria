REACTIONS came fast to the article that appeared in this column last week captioned ‘Whiteman, Blackman.’ I feel obliged to address them given the interest the column has elicited and the importance that is attached to the subject. Following are the questions:
1). What is the place of the quest for and use of technology in the affairs of human especially its instrumentality in successfully subjugating the Blackman?
2). How have the Brown races delivered themselves from Whiteman without fights on the streets of the latter?
3). The issue of religion:  If all are equal as claimed, why is it difficult to mention African religions by names (they do have names), even when your write-up got to Africa, and Greek gods were mentioned?
4). What should we say about predominantly White and Brown countries (Scandinavian countries, and Japan as examples) who are resisting Black people from forming significant proportion of their population? Are they racists or just taking precautions against “Floyd incidents” soiling their countries?
5). The Blackman in his native countries, what is he doing? Why is his progress so slow? Why does he prefer to die in the seas and deserts rather than being a slave in and salvaging his own country? Japanese worked in their in their country like slaves and when prosperity came, are enjoying it together).
6). Re-incarnation? Thankfully, you yourself filled that section with a lot of why’s. A weak link in a beautiful write-up. Why can’t Black people give birth to Whites, even when there are inter-racial marriages?
   As space will not permit the questions being properly answered today as some of them are a subject of a full essay of their own, an attempt will however be made to answer them next week in a way that they will throw more light on the subject that remains a burning issue and is of great interest to a great many everywhere.
