The Rights Enforcement and Public Law Centre (REPLACE), the Rule of Law and Anti-Corruption Programme of the British Council, Justice for Peace and Development Initiative (JPDI), Ngwunta Chambers and Legal Resources Consortium (LRC) have initiated a project, entitled ‘Improving Access to Legal Advice and Services,’ for vulnerable persons in Mushin and Oshodi areas of Lagos State. The project is designed to provide legal assistance to women, children and people living with disabilities through the help of volunteers comprising lawyers and paralegals under the Police Duty Solicitors Scheme (PDSS). At the weekend, some physically challenged persons, women and traders in Mushin and Oshodi constituencies benefitted from the community sensitisation and free legal aid clinic by REPLACE. Barrister Nathaniel from JDPI noted that during the five-week lockdown, there were reported escalation in the infringement of rights in many communities, reason the initiative seeks to provide free legal assistance to disadvantaged persons at the grassroots. “We want to provide access to justice for these disadvantaged and vulnerable persons who may have been in conflict with the law regarding the COVID-19 protocols. Many have been arrested and detained unjustly.” Kehinde Ajobi, chairman of the National Association of Persons with Physical Disabilities in Mushin Local Government Area, said many of their members have been affected by the Lagos State government policies on transportation, which were enforced shortly before the pandemic. “Our major challenge is public transport. The majority of us don’t own a car and it has not been easy for us commuting in areas where ban on Keke NAPEP and okada is in place.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
