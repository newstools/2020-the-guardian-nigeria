The Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) extended the bearish sentiments at the reopening of transactions yesterday, even as more blue-chip stocks depreciated in price, especially Beta Glass and Julius Berger, resulting in a further slide in the market capitalisation by N162 billion.
 
Yesterday, the All Share Index (ASI) shed 310.07 points or 1.27 per cent to 24,026.05 points. Accordingly, investors lost N162 billion in value as market capitalisation dropped to N12.533 trillion.
 
The downturn was impacted by losses recorded in medium and large value stocks, including Nestle Nigeria, Beta Glass, BUA Cement, Julius Berger, and C & I Leasing.
   
Analysts at Afrinvest Limited, said: “We expect bargain hunting to drive gains in the next trading session.”
   
Also, analysts at APT Securities and Funds Limited, said: “We expect a slowdown in market activity in a short while before positive rally picks up in mid to long term owing to anticipatory half year earnings release.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
