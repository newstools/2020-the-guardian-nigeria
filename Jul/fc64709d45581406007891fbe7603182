Heartland Football Club players, members of staff and management are worried over the non- payment of their salaries for five months. They said the situation has put them to untold hardship. Some, who spoke with The Guardian, said they had not been paid since February. Despite the situation, coach of the club, Fidelis Ilechukwu, said though he was owed, he would not quit the club, adding the decision to retain or sack him was that of the club’s management. A member of staff, who pleaded anonymity, lamented that they were no longer able to meet their family obligations. He urged Governor Hope Uzodinma to come to their aid by approving and releasing of funds for the purpose. “We are suffering. Staying five months without salary is terrible. We are urging the governor to approve and release funds for our salaries. We are pleading,” he said. Contacted, the Imo State Deputy Chief of Staff, Dr. Pat Ekeji, pleaded with the players and officials for patience, explaining that the governor has a comprehensive package for the sports sub- sector, which he would unfold soon.
