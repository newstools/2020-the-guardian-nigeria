• NNPC, NDPC, Seplat donate equipment to Edo Others
• Bayelsa to enforce compulsory use of face masks Following the increasing cases of coronavirus in Delta State, the government has resolved to intensify the ‘war’ against violators of its directives by adopting stringent measures aimed at ensuring full compliance with prescribed protocols. Commissioner for Information, Charles Aniagwu, who disclosed this in Asaba, yesterday, said the state government was determined to contain the spread of the virus. He said some of the measures include establishment of more mobile courts to try defaulters and introduction of new COVID-19 guidelines to ensure that spread of the virus was effectively curtailed in the state. “Based on the increase in the number of COVID-19 cases, more stringent measures will be taken to ensure compliance. The pandemic is real and more mobile courts will be established to try those who flout the protocols. “Also, a task force to ensure compliance will be set up and any hotel, bar or restaurant that flouts the protocols will be closed. Our people need to know that COVID-19 is not a death sentence, so they should go for screening. “As a government, we will not watch individuals endanger the lives of others and we will deploy new protocols to be enforced by the task force,” he stated. Relatedly, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Nigerian Petroleum Development Company (NPDC) Limited and Seplat Petroleum Development Company Plc have donated equipment to Edo, Delta and Imo states to contain the coronavirus pandemic. The joint venture (JV) partners explained that the gesture was part of their corporate social responsibility (CSR) to the benefitting states.They donated 25 hospital beds and transport ventilator each to Edo and Delta states, while Imo got 25 hospital beds, sanitary buckets, 300 alcohol-based hand sanitisers, Infrared thermometers, 300 pieces of N95 face mask, hand gloves, organic soap and a transport ventilator, among others. This was in addition to the motorised sprayers, knapsack sprayers, protective eye goggles, and other personal protective equipment (PPEs) they donated to the states in April. Meanwhile, the Bayelsa State government has given a five-day ultimatum for the residents to compulsorily wear face in the state, especially in Yenagoa, the state capital. A statement issued by the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Information and Orientation, Freston Akpor, disclosed that enforcement of the directive would begin next Monday and would be monitored by the security sub-committee of the task force on COVID-19. Akpor noted that these were part of the decisions reached at a meeting presided over by the Deputy Governor, Lawrence Ehwrudjakpo, and attended by stakeholders.
