Mourns late FFIG president Imo State Commissioner for Youth, Sports and Social Development, Dan Ogu, has unveiled the government’s plans to reposition the state-owned women football club, Heartland Queens, saying there is a programme to make the team the model for women football in Nigeria. Speaking while commiserating with the women football family on the recent death of one of the promoters of the game, Henrietta Ukaigwe, Ogu said the state would engage all the stakeholders in its efforts to move into the top bracket of the country’s sports sector. “Governor Hope Uzodinma’s administration is poised to give equal and deserving attention to all aspects and sectors of our society. Sports in this state are about to be rebranded and there will be no gender discrimination. I believe this was what our late sister stood for,” he said. The Commissioner who only last week had the sports portfolio added to his office, said with the death of Ukaigwe, Imo State has lost an illustrious daughter and a big campaigner for the development of womenfolk in general and women football in particular. Ogu said Ukaigwe, who was the president of the Female Football Interest Group, died when her efforts was about to be recognized and complemented by the current state government which is pursuing a sports policy that will reposition and rebrand the state-owned female team, Heartland Queens Football Club. “People like Henrietta are some of those we were hoping to tap on their experiences and service to beam the light in this direction of youth sports and social development. It is unfortunate that death has robbed us what would have been a great and selfless service from her,” he added.
