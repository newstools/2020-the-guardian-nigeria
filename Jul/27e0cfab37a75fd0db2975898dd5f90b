Ghanian Actress Akuapem Poloo Apologises After Going Naked To Celebrate Son’s Birthday Ghanaian Actress, Rosemond Alade Brown, popularly known as Akuapem Poloo, has apologised for a nude picture with her son posted on social media to mark his seventh birthday. The actress came under fire after she posted a nude picture of herself and her son on her Instagram page. In the now-deleted picture, the actress was nude as she squatted before her half-naked seven-year-old son, holding his hands. Explaining the picture, she wrote: I’m naked in front of you because this is how naked I was giving birth to you, so in case you find me naked lying somewhere don’t pass by me but rather see me as your mom who brought you to life. Happy birthday to you @sonof_poloo The Child Rights International, a child rights organization, petitioned the Ghanaian Police Criminal Investigations Department (CID) to look into the matter. In a released statement, they wrote: As a child rights organisation, we deem this act as a violation of the Welfare Principle of the Children’s Act and abuse of the child’s rights to privacy and dignity. We wish to notify your esteemed office to investigate the taking of the said images and its circulation. After being heavily criticised, the actress released a video apologising for her action. She said: As an artist, whatever I post is an artistic impression. I’m not trying to put porn on my page or playing porn with him. I am so sorry if I hurt anyone with my post this morning. I also want you to know that it wasn’t made with a bad intention. She went further to defend her actions. In the video, she explained that the act was meant to teach the public about caring for parents, especially mothers regardless of their deprived state. What I was saying was that, no matter how naked you see your parent, don’t run away from them. Get close to them and cloth them.
