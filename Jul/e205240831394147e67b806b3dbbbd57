• Task new SEC DG on master plan review, collaboration
Experts have called on the new management of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), to ensure that the revised blueprint for capital market development is integrated into the Federal Government’s second Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP) 2021–2025, to accelerate market development.
 
Besides, the stakeholders also advocate an assessment of the implementation of the capital market master plan to determine outstanding issues with a view to revising and updating the roadmap. The request comes two days after the new Director-General (DG) of the SEC, Lamido Yuguda, assumed office alongside three executive commissioners; Reginald Karawusa, Ibrahim Boyi, and Dayo Obisan. Yuguda’s confirmation comes one year after the former DG, Mary Uduk, spearheaded the affairs of the Commission in an acting capacity.
 
Specifically, a professor of Capital Market, and Head of Banking and Finance Department at the Nasarawa State University, Keffi, Uche Uwaleke, said this is vital because the current ERGP paid little attention to equities market issues.  “It goes without saying that the new DG will need the support of SEC staff to succeed. So, I expect him to also take as a matter of priority the issue of staff welfare.”
 
The Publicity Secretary, Independent Shareholders Association, Moses Igbrude, said the new management should adopt a collaborative approach in handling investor-related matters to sustain market confidence. He also underscored the importance of the capital market to economic growth, noting that the understanding will compel the government to initiate policies that will enhance market growth.  “I want to congratulate the SEC DG on his appointment and assumption of duty. It’s my expectation that he will position the market for efficiency and effectiveness. There is a need to appraise and reposition the capital market master plan to fit into the post COVID era. “Also, education and awareness on capital market related activities should be intensified. More so, the laws on investor protection should be strengthened to guarantee safety of investment in the capital market.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
