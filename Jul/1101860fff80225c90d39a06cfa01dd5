The impeachment process against Ondo State deputy governor, Agboola Ajayi, has suffered a major set back as the chief judge of the state, Oluwatoyin Akeredolu, faulted the process. Akeredolu in a letter dated July 9, 2020, declared that the request earlier made by the state Assembly to her for the constitution of a 7-man probe panel didn’t meet the constitutional requirement. 14 out of 26 members of the House, on Tuesday, had signed a notice of impeachment of the deputy governor. They had ordered the judiciary to constitute a panel to probe him. But nine members of the Assembly kicked against the impeachment, while Ajayi had also sought a court injunction to stop the process. The Chief Judge said the request violated Section 188 (5)of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria as amended. “I wish to draw the attention of the Honourable Speaker of the House of Assembly of Ondo State to the provisions of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended).” She explained the constitutional requirements as stipulated in Section 188 (1), (2) (a), (b), adding that there was a court proceeding on the matter. “In view foregoing, the Hon. Members of the House of Assembly have not completed the constitutional process that would lead your very good self to invite my humble self to set up a panel of 7 to investigate allegations of gross misconduct as stipulated in the Constitution. “Furthermore I wish to bring to your notice the copy of letter which I received earlier today from Kayode Olatoke, SAN which letter tells me clearly that the matter of impeachment of Hon. Alfred Agboola Ajayi, Deputy Governor of Ondo State is sub judice.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
