The Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Mohammed Adamu, on Wednesday distanced himself from the detention of the suspended acting Chairman of the country’s anti-graft agency, Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Ibrahim Magu. Magu, the embattled former anti-corruption helmsman is being quizzed by Justice Ayo Salami-led presidential investigation panel. Specifically, the former EFCC boss has been detained for 10 days running by the committee for sundry corruption allegations brought against him by the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami. While still being detained, Magu’s lawyer, Tosin Ojoamo, had written to the police boss seeking bail for his client. However, the IGP in a response to the request, shrugged off responsibility in Magu’s detention predicament, directing focus to the presidential panel. In a letter addressed to the lawyer, the IGP explained that Magu was not being held by the police but by the panel investigating the activities of the anti-corruption agency. The IGP response read in part: “Your letter 00C/TOL/89A/07/2020 of 10th July 2020 on the above-underlined subject refers. “The Inspector-General of Police directs that your attention be drawn to the fact that the Nigeria Police Force is not investigating C.P. Ibrahim Magu (your client) and he is accordingly, not being detained by the police but by the presidential panel that is investigating the activities of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). “The Inspector-General of Police, therefore, advises that you consider re-directing your request to the Chairman of the presidential panel for appropriate attention. “I am to convey the assurances of the warmest regards of the Inspector of Police, please.” The document was signed by DCP Owohunwa, Principal Staff Officer for the Inspector General of Police.
