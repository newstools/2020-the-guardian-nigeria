• Worshipers gear up for low-key Eid-el-Kabir, thankful for being alive amid COVID-19
• LAWMA seeks proper waste disposal AS Nigerians join the rest of the world tomorrow to mark Eid-el-Kabir (Sallah), also known as the Festival of Sacrifice, the Lagos State governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, yesterday said the boy in a viral video begging his mother to ‘calm down’ while punishing him for an offence he committed inspired his special Sallah message to Lagosians because of the deeper meaning it conveys.
 
The boy was seen in a video, which left social media users laughing, appealing to his mother to “calm down and rest a little,” while begging her to pardon and give him a last chance.
 
Sanwo-Olu said: “Fellow Lagosians, we need to ‘calm down’ as we enjoy the coming holiday and festivity. It is a commemoration of Prophet Ibrahim’s heart of sacrifice and faith in Allah. We need to emulate and demonstrate his sense of self- restraint at this time the world is combating the scourge of #COVID19. We need to be moderate in our celebration and observe prescribed protocols towards defeating the deadly coronavirus. I urge every Lagosian to ‘calm down’ and not get carried away.
