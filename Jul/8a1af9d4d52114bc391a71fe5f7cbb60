 MIDLAND, TX – JULY 29: President Donald Trump speaks to city officials and employees of Double Eagle Energy on the site of an active oil rig on July 29, 2020 in Midland, Texas. Trump began his visit to the Permian Basin at a fundraising event in Odessa and concluded in Midland for a tour the oil rig and to discuss energy policy.   Montinique Monroe/Getty Images/AFP  “Delay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote???” Trump asked in a tweet. “With Universal Mail-In Voting (not Absentee Voting, which is good), 2020 will be the most INACCURATE & FRAUDULENT Election in history. It will be a great embarrassment to the USA,” the tweet said. Only Congress can change the election date, which is set by law on November 3. With Democrats ruling the lower House, that seems highly unlikely to happen. Trump has previously insisted that he sees no problem going ahead with the election, where he faces Democratic challenger Joe Biden. The coronavirus pandemic remains out of control in swaths of the United States, including most recently in Republican-led states like Florida and Texas. During the presidential primary contests earlier this year, several states delayed voting or opened fewer polling sites. In addition, major sporting events have been cancelled or curtailed and there are serious doubts across much of the country over whether schools and universities will reopen in September. But Trump has bitterly resisted Democratic-led attempts to increase the availability of mail-in voting, saying that this will promote fraud and that Americans should line up at the polls as usual. His opponents say there is no evidence of meaningful fraud in US elections and rather that more effort is needed to improve the complicated logistics of mail-in voting.
