• Speaker, Oshun Deny Rift The atmosphere was a mixture of calm after a raging storm. But is the storm over? Going by the facial expression displayed by the member representing Lagos Mainland Constituency 2, Moshood Oshun, when he addressed journalists recently, there seemed to be some internal misgivings.
 
Oshun, who was visibly enraged as he spoke said he was terribly displeased by the massive representations being splashed on many online publications, which portrayed him negatively in the past two weeks.
 
Although the reports disclosed that Oshun harbours some issues of personal concern about the Lagos State House of Assembly, he told journalists that there was no issue whatsoever between him and the Speaker, Mr. Mudashiru Obasa.  Echoes Of Distrust
THE insinuation in some quarters is that there is more to the rift between Obasa and Oshun, just as some sources said the reverberations of the ongoing power play at the APC national headquarters, Southwest zone of the party and Lagos chapter have continued to billow in the Lagos Assembly.
   
It is taken for granted that Obasa and Oshun have found themselves on different sides of the intrigues. As such, what flicked into the media, especially the attempt to malign Oshun and pit him against Obasa and the Assembly, could as well be the handiwork of enemies of APC family in Lagos intent on dismantling the structure before 2023.
