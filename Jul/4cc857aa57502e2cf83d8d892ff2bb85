Urges SEC to enlighten business community Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF) Boss Mustapha has said that failure by many Nigerians to believe in the existence of coronavirus posts a great challenge to the fight against the pandemic by the Presidential Task Force [PTF] on COVID-19. Mustapha, who expressed dismay over the low level of compliance with the rules of engagement put in place by the government to tackle the pandemic, noted that many Nigerians had continued to flout the directives to observe social distancing, wear face masks, use hand sanitizers and subject themselves to temperature testing “while some even say the pandemic is a hoax.” The SGF, who doubles as the chairman of PTF, made the comments yesterday while receiving a Toyota ambulance bus donated by the Capital Market Community to boost the fight against the pandemic in Abuja. Represented by the Permanent Secretary (General Services), Mr. Adekunle Olusegun, the SGF urged Nigerians to protect themselves and others from being infected by observing all government and health authorities’ laid down protocols. ‘’Even if you do not love anyone, I believe you love yourself, secure yourself properly by adhering to laid down protocols. Masks should be worn properly when in public places and if you are not wearing your mask properly, you are at risk. In your offices, ensure that you are very strict on the use of face mask.’’ Mustapha said there were still some challenges ahead, especially in the area of behavioural change, urging the capital market community to use whatever opportunity available to enlighten stakeholders. “This is a serious health emergency that we are experiencing in our generation, it has challenged the strength and weaknesses of the system globally and no nation is immune from this. What we do is to provide leadership and guidance by formulating policies that will help to guide the sub-national activities and to develop their capacities in response to this pandemic. All the measures we have taken are well thought out, however, our challenge is risk communication and community engagements. If you have any of the symptoms, seek help and observe all the hygiene prescriptions. If you do not have any business to go out, stay at home, especially those in the vulnerable group, the strategy is to test, detect, isolate, treat and trace.” Making the donation on behalf of the capital market community, the Director-General of Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Lamido Yuguda, commended the PTF for all efforts made so far to combat the pandemic in Nigeria. ‘’We are here today on behalf of the capital market because we recognise the need to lend our support towards strengthening the available response mechanisms as well as ameliorating the burdens on those affected,’’ Yuguda said.
