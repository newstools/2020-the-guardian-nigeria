Residents of Isawo community in Ikorodu area of Lagos State were, on Sunday, thrown into mourning after a 23-year-old lady committed suicide over alleged abuse from her elder brother. The lady, identified as Sherifat Suleiman, was said to have killed herself after efforts to ensure her elder brother stopped his incessant molestation proved abortive in Ikorodu-West Local Council Development Area (LCDA). It was gathered that due to the failed efforts, the lady, described as gentle by neighbours, was said to have consumed a substance believed to be an insecticide after she was beaten by her brother on Sunday. An eyewitness narrated that Sherifat was discovered writhing in pains by residents and was rushed to the hospital for treatment. He added that the 23-year-old, who had visible marks of assaults on the right thigh, died a few minutes before she was rushed to the hospital. When the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Bala Elkana, was contacted, he promised to respond later, but as of the time of writing this report, the police spokesman was yet to respond to the inquiry.
