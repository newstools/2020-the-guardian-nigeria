Kim Kardashian West Emotional During Meeting With Kanye West Image TMZ The reunion between Kim Kardashian and her husband Kanye West was very emotional. The 39-year-old Keeping Up With The Kardashians star was pictured crying while in a car with Kanye outside Wendy’s in Cody, Wyoming. The reality star had flown in to speak to her husband face-to-face after he had attacked her on Twitter before publicly apologising during what Kim has described as a ‘bipolar episode’. According to a source as reported by The Mirror: As soon as Kim got to the ranch, she and Kanye came out together in his car. She is very emotional about everything and also exhausted. She feels very hurt by Kanye. She has tried to reach him multiple times and he just ignores her. It’s all a bad situation. She decided to fly to Cody to speak to him in person. She doesn’t want to be ignored anymore. Rapper Kanye had claimed in some deleted Twitter posts that he had been “trying to divorce” Kim for two years after she met Meek Mill in a hotel for a meeting about prison reform. Kim recently spoke out in support of her husband on Instagram, nearly five days after Kanye caused a storm at his US presidential campaign rally, where he claimed that they discussed terminating their first pregnancy. On Saturday, Kanye West was pictured going to the hospital. He spent time at a hospital close to hear his Wyoming ranch on Saturday before an ambulance showed up at his property later in the day.
