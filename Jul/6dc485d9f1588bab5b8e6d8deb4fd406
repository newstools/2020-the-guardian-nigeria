Some trigger-happy policemen attached to Adigboluja Police Station at Ojodu, Berger area of Ogun State have allegedly shot and killed a motorcycle rider and injured three others. It was learnt that the motorcyclists were protesting against hike in ticket fee imposed on them by a newly created body called Riders and Owners of Motorcycle Organisation (ROMO) by the Ogun State government. The motorcyclists were said to be paying N200 as ticket fee before the establishment of ROMO, but the ticket fee was increased to N500 yesterday, which the riders rejected, leading to the clash.
