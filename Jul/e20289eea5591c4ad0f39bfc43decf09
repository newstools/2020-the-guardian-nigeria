An appellate court sitting in Lagos has upheld the 60-year sentence of a former supervisor of Chrisland School, Adegboyega Adenekan, who was convicted of defiling a two-year and-11-month-old pupil, (name withheld) of the school.
 
Justice Sybil Nwaka had, on October 24,2019, convicted Adenekan after finding him guilty of defilement filed against him by the state government.
 
Dissatisfied with the judgement, Adenekan’s counsel, Mr Olatunde Adejuyigbe (SAN), proceeded to the appellate court to challenge the decision of the lower court.
 
Delivering judgement yesterday, the three-man panel, led by Justice Mohammad Garba, dismissed the appeal for lack of merit.  She said “that the convict put his mouth in her wee-wee, the first time he did that, he took her out of the class, the second time, she ran.
 
“I tried to report to my teacher but my teacher did not believe me. So, I reported to my mummy. First time he did it was inside his office which has a toilet. The second time he did it was in the hall, which was outside. I did not like what he did. He put his hand in my wee-wee, he put his wee-wee in my wee-wee and he put his mouth in my wee-wee,” the pupil narrated.
