Pioneer Chief Disruptor Officer of Fintech Platform, The Beetle, Joseph Edgar, is 51 later this July. Celebrating the day, Edgar gave out over N2m cash to four widows and empower several youths, as part of activities outlined to mark the birthday soiree. His 50th birthday, last year, was a testament to Edgarâ€™s philanthropic gestures, as he gave out massively to society. An investment banker by profession, Edgar is also an influential writer, author, and filmmaker, who maintains a weekly column called Loudwhispers. Still basking in the euphoria of his last play entitled Aremu, a story on the life of former President Olusegun Obasanjo. This was just after delivering Emotan, the highly emotional play about the famed Bini pseudo deity, which was screened in Lagos and Benin, the Edo State capital.
