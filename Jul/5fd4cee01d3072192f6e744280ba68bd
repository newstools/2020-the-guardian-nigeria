Tottenham boss Jose Mourinho fears football is going in the wrong direction after his side had a goal controversially ruled out by VAR in the 3-1 defeat at Sheffield United. Blades boss Chris Wilder said the technology was a farce after Harry Kane’s equalising strike was chalked off for handball in the build-up. Lucas Moura’s arm appeared to brush the ball as he fell under a challenge. “The referee is in the office,” said Mourinho. “I never complain at the guy with the whistle because it’s not the referee any more. “I think the referee should always be the man on the pitch and the people in the office should just support and assist. “That’s not the way it is. The referee who is not very good on the pitch, we cannot expect that he’s good in the office. “We’re going in a direction that’s really bad for the beautiful game, the game that everybody fell in love with.” ‘We cannot mentally die from Michael Oliver’s decision’ Tottenham struggled to find their rhythm after that decision as the Blades eased to victory thanks to goals by Sander Berge, Lys Mousset and Oli McBurnie, before Kane grabbed a late consolation. Mourinho, whose side are now nine points off fourth place and seven off sixth, said his players need to be stronger mentally to deal with decisions that are difficult to take. The former Chelsea boss added: “We have to do better, we have to be mentally stronger to cope with what happened during the game. “We cannot mentally die after Michael Oliver’s decision.”
