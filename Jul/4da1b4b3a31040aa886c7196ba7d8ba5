The House of Representatives Committee on Diaspora, has urged states to support the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP), in rehabilitating trafficked victims. Chairman of the committee, Rep. Tolulope Akande-Sadipe, (APC-Oyo), made the call while receiving 29 victims of human trafficking from Lebanon, on Saturday in Abuja. The rep said that nine of the girls were from Oyo 9, three from Ondo, two from Delta, and one each from Ekiti, Ebonyi, Cross Rivers, Edo and Anambra respectively. She said that the fight against human trafficking could not be left for the Federal Government alone, saying that state governments and other stakeholders had roles to play. “We call on state governors going forward to support NAPTIP to ensure that the girls are properly rehabilitated. “At the same time, let us make sure they are ambassadors against human trafficking to discourage other young girls from thinking that there are greener pastures over there, when really there are not. “There are more girls coming home, we need to come together as a nation to put a stop to human trafficking. “We need to come together as nation to provide for girls and stop them from traveling abroad in search of greener pastures,” she said. Narrating her ordeal, one of the victims, Miss Priscilla Chidibem, said that she was made to work all day under very horrible conditions. Chidibem, who was on wheel chair, explained a fracture she sustained in her waist whilst doing the job, developed complications, putting her in her current condition. She said her employers made her worked hard in spite of the pains and even assaulted her when should could not walk. “I cried day and night, I almost committed suicide twice, but jettisoned the idea when I remembered my mother. “If I took my life, I do not think my mother will be able to survive it, I went through hell, I cannot explain, I was sick and was abused,” she said.
