Ghanaian Actress Rosemond Alade Brown better known as Akuapem Poloo has been arrested by the police over a nude photoshoot with her seven-year-old son which went viral on social media. According to Ghanaweb, Akuapem Poloo was picked up by operatives of Ghana’s Criminal Investigations Department (CID) and was sent to the headquarters of the Domestic Violence and Victim Support Unit. In the photo which was posted on Tuesday, June 30, in celebration of her son’s birthday, the actress squatted in the nude in front of her son who was only in his underwear. “I’m naked in front of you because this is how naked I was giving birth to you, so in case you find me naked lying somewhere don’t pass by me but rather see me as your mom who brought you to life. Happy birthday to you @sonof_poloo” Following the uproar on social media, the Child Rights International petitioned the Ghanaian Police Criminal Investigations Department (CID) to look into the matter. In a released statement, they wrote: “As a child rights organisation, we deem this act as a violation of the Welfare Principle of the Children’s Act and abuse of the child’s rights to privacy and dignity. We wish to notify your esteemed office to investigate the taking of the said images and its circulation” Akuapem Poloo later apologised in a video in which she said that the photo was an artistic impression: “As an artist, whatever I post is an artistic impression. I’m not trying to put porn on my page or playing porn with him. I am so sorry if I hurt anyone with my post this morning. I also want you to know that it wasn’t made with a bad intention.” She added that the act was meant to teach the public to care for their parents irrespective of the state of their appearance. “What I was saying was that, no matter how naked you see your parent, don’t run away from them. Get close to them and cloth them.”
