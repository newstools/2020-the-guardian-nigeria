The Muaythai Federation of Nigeria (MFN) has praised Kwara State’s outgoing Director of Sports and Chairman, Nigerian Directors of Sports Forum, Coach Tunde Kazeem for his contributions to the country’s sports development. Muaythai Federation of Nigeria President, Comrade Paul Egonu, while thanking God for Kazeem’s successful tenure, said Muaythai Federation has been successful within and outside the state as a result of the support it received from the Sports Council led by the outgoing director of sports. He appreciated Kazeem, who is the longest serving director of sports in the history of Kwara State Sports Council, for his contributions to the development of sports and Muaythai during his tenure. Among the accomplishments, Egonu said Kazeem worked hard in ensuring that Muaythai sport was readmitted into the National Sports Festival as a demonstration sport at the now postponed Edo 2020 Games, adding that he supported the federation in its quest to take Muaythai to an enviable height. Even as Kazeem has bowed out of service, Egonu said the Muaythai Federation would continue to seek his support in the quest to popularise the sport in the country.
