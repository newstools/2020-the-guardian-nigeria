In his acceptance speech, Burna Boy spoke on African development, saying, “Second time and I appreciate it. I will like to use this opportunity to say that sometime around 1835, there was admission to turn the nation of Africa into a dominated nation. Now is the time to return and go back to the royalty that we were because in order for black lives to matter, Africa must matter.” Meanwhile, the African Giant singer recently released a brand new vibe, titled Wonderful off his upcoming album, Twice As Nice. The new hit is a song that makes the listener proud to be black and African, as it engages from deep within. Indeed African, the song reminds the listener that wherever you are, as you hustle and go about your business, when all goes wrong, you can always come back home and start all over again because home is where the heart is. In the new offering, Burna goes poetic when he says the motherland is home, because ‘my mother is at home’ and home is where the family is. Music no doubt is a language that transcends all code and barriers of country, region or continent. Hence, Africa is a continent of rhythm and sounds; of movement and synergy, hence this samba-sounding track has encapsulated these features that represent the pure African sound. Burna Boy said, “Seeing the wonders of my music, interacting with people while touring makes me realise that I’m blessed that my music is universal, blessed that people react to my music whether they understand it or not.” He continued: “The COVID-19 pandemic forcing people to stay home, when they didn’t plan for it, made me reflect on the wonder of just being home and being able to survive under such dire circumstances.” The new single is available on all music platforms for streaming and download.
