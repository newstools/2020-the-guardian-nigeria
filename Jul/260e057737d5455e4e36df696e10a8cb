Twenty-four hours after 21 youths were shot dead at a wedding in Kukum Daji Village of Kaura Council, Kaduna State, gunmen invaded Gora Gan village in Zango-Kataf Council of the state killing the village head, a six-year-old boy and nine others. Many other villagers sustained injuries while running for dear lives. Witnesses said that 20 gunmen suspected to be armed herdsmen invaded the village around 7.10p.m. on Monday and started shooting sporadically. Vice Chairman of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) in Zango-Kataf, Isaac Ango-Makama, who confirmed the incident, said several houses were razed during the attack. He said remains of the dead had been deposited at the Zonkwa General Hospital morgue, while the injured were rushed to an undisclosed hospital for treatment. “The villagers are still searching for their missing loved ones,” the pastor added. Secretary of Mercy Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) camp, Zonkwa, Ezekiel James, said they were in dire need of support to cater for the displaced persons. Noting that the camp needed drugs and facilities to treat traumatised IDPs, he appealed to privileged individuals to help in alleviating their plight. Meanwhile, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state has condemned the attack, saying it was unacceptable. The Publicity Secretary, Abraham Catoh, stated that Governor Nasir el-Rufai was not doing enough to curb the insecurity in the state. The Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) in Kaduna, ASP Muhammad Jalige, did not respond to calls put across to him to confirm the incident.
