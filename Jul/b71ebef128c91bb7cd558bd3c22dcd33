The farm animals once gathered on an idle afternoon. Though the sun was at peak, the animals were in high spirit, except for one – the tortoise. Tortoise was the witty one, with guile and theatrics to light up any gathering, but not on this afternoon. He was in a somber mood, as if bereaved and broken. It didn’t take too long to have him noticed. With persuasion from others, he broke the silence: “I feel like killing my wife,” tortoise said, and the gathering erupted with shock. Abomination! “She has completely gone wayward and I can’t think of any remedy than for someone to die,” tortoise said, as he lowered his head, reclining into the shell.
   
All the animals had formed a ring around Mr. Tortoise. He was pained and livid too. But not saying much leaves others confused. “Wait Tortie,” Pig snorted, “how bad can your wife be compared with mine that is unkempt and smelly?” “Worse,” Tortoise voiced from the deep. The animals grinned at each other. Bird chirped: “does she gossips and parrots like mine?” “Good for you,” said Tortoise. “Is she so bad a lazybones, sleeps all day and completely useless?” Snail inquired. They heard Tortoise hissed in disapproval.
  
Horse was the next to speak. “My wife snores and her wide mouth keeps the neighbourhood awake all night. How else can a husbandman be unfortunate?” “I will be glad to have yours,” came from Tortoise. Others were getting impatient when the cat purred, “does she steal, tell lies and break promises like mine?” Silence. Dog didn’t wait further: “tell us your wife is adulterous. I have been living with that all my life and didn’t kill anyone…” Tortoise emerged from the shell. “Mine is worse than that. My wife combines all vices because of one thing. She has no shame (itiju). Nothing more can be worse.”  That is, the excess or deficiency of a good conduct leads to its corresponding vice(s). For instance, courage is a virtue. Its excess is foolhardiness and deficiency is cowardice; both of which are vices. Ditto for the virtue of respect, whose excess and deficiency are deference and exploitation, in that order. But, unknown to the West, itiju (shame) aligns with that framework too. Oladimeji Ajikobi  observed that Itiju (shame) is a virtue, implying moderation, caution, self-regard and self-respect in conduct. Its excess (a vice) is tiju/onitiju, that is, shyness, ashamed, leading to docility and timidity to dangerous extent. The deficiency of the concept is alainitiju, that is, shamelessness, an immodest or shameless fellow. While the middle course (itiju) and its excess (tiju) are morally tolerable, the deficiency (alainitiju) is completely immoral and condemnable by all cultures, including the farm animals.  
  
Shamelessness is the harbinger of all other vices. And anyone that has no sense of modesty or restraint is a loose cannon. Among the Yoruba where itiju represents the peoples mores, cultural orthopraxy and liken to a celestial gift, it is often said that eni ti ko ni itiju, apa Olorun o ka (a shameless fellow is beyond God’s control). How much more that of men or the community? And that explains the pains of Mr. Tortoise, the significance of the opening myth and similar conversations some grumpy husbandmen do have about their wives at beer joints. In fairness, some committees of wives also do complain and compare notes of vices of their men too, just as many Nigerians complain about the undoing of our leaders. Across the board, everyone can tell that shamelessness is a grand vice that has wrecked all manner of havocs in contemporary society.  Shamelessness has many colours and hardly discriminates among the shameless. With elections coming up in some states, politicians have started apologising for misleading the electorates, wasting the time and resources of their State for years. The Peoples’ Democratic Party once apologised for looting the country dry! Shamelessly, they still expect the people to trust them and get reelected. Recall that the Federal Fire Service, Abuja, once hurriedly repackaged old fire trucks and ambulances, and invited the FCT Minister to commission them as new equipment! In Lagos State, the flagship ‘state-of-the-art’ Cardiac and Renal Centre, Gbagada, built with N5.6 billion during Babatunde Fashola’s administration parades obsolete equipment and has never worked for a day. The House of Assembly started probe in 2016 and has still not made headway. Like the NDDC’s forensic audit, and the FCT debacle, nothing will come out of the Lagos medical fraud.  It is mind-boggling that all hopes of the corruption war have vanished or now in tatters. Someone already called it ‘The Buhari Meltdown!’ It is regrettable that man’s inhumanity to man is freely expressing itself. It is a bigger shame that governments across all levels have become accomplices, and would not care a hoot, even if the whole country crumbles under the weight of ‘loyal’ yet shameless corrupt officials.
