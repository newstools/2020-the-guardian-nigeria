Two months into his second year in office as governor, the people of Ogun State have begun to express worry over Prince Dapo Abiodun’s alleged sluggish approach to governance.
 
Ogun State citizens, who say they are losing patience over the governor’s snail speed, maintain that the nature of his emergence, especially the stiff opposition to his emergence from his predecessor, Senator Ibikunle Amosun, was enough to spur him into expeditious performance.
 
It would be recalled that a section of the state All Progressives Congress (APC), which left the party, joined the newly formed Allied Peoples Movement (APM).
   
Wining the election against all odds, the people of the Gateway state therefore saw Prince Abiodun as the much-awaited Messiah to turn the fortunes of the state around within the shortest possible time.  “All the previous governors were sworn in with one united and very loyal party structure behind them, unlike in Dapo’s case, where the crisis keeps festering, until its present position that threatens an implosion. Nonetheless, after the administration settled down and fully stabilised, he got his government policies, projects and programmes speaking for his administration. “Meanwhile, besides, and notwithstanding all of the above, for anyone to rate the Amosun government anywhere near the performance of Dapo Abiodun would be an exercise that is denied logic, simply because you can’t successfully compare a government that is performing and developing each and all sectors to a government of a mono-sector performance.
