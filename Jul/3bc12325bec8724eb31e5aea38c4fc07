I Love you and happy 21th birthday” The 33-year-old in previous interviews has said that he isn’t sure whether he would push any future child of his towards athletics, feeling that their father’s legacy could be too tough a cross to bear. “That’s going to be hard for my kid,” he said, via the Mail Online. “If they want to do it, I’m fine with it. But initially I’m going to say don’t do it, because I know the pressure that will come along with it.” Born Usain St Leo Bolt, the Jamaican former sprinter is widely considered to be the greatest sprinter of all time. He is a world record holder in the 100 metres, 200 metres and 4 × 100 metres relay. An eight-time Olympic gold medallist, Bolt is the only sprinter to win Olympic 100 m and 200 m titles at three consecutive Olympics (2008, 2012 and 2016). Bolt retired from athletics after the 2017 World Championships in London following a hamstring injury
