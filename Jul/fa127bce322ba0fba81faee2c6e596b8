Four suspected members of a gang that specialises in robbing people in traffic on the Mile 2-Badagry Expressway, Lagos State, have been arrested and have confessed to robbing and raping their female victims under the bridge at Maza-Maza. Detectives said three of the suspects were arrested at a hotel on Old Ojo Road, Lagos, where they had gone camping with their girlfriends. The police said Chima Christopher, aged 25, was first arrested at Aiyenero Street, off Okoya by Old Ojo Road, Ajegunle. Three other suspects nabbed in the hotel were identified as Azeez Sulaimon, 24; Shakiru Oke, 25 and Yusuf Ganiu, 25. They were among suspects paraded before newsmen on Wednesday by the Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu, at the command headquarters in Ikeja. “We attack mostly female passengers who come to board vehicles going to the eastern states. Most of them are traders who came to buy goods in Lagos. They usually arrive at the park at Maza-Maza late at night and are compelled to sleep at the park before boarding early in the morning. “Once in a while, they go out to get something to eat or to urinate. We follow the ones going to urinate quietly and we will pounce on her when she gets to the bushy area. Here, we will collect their valuables before raping them,” they confessed. Odumosu said that 36 stolen phones were recovered from the suspects. “They were arrested with 36 different brand of phones suspected to have been stolen from different victims around Mile 2, Oshodi, Ijora, Case Way, Eko Bridge and environs. The suspects will be charged to court at the end of investigation,” he added.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
