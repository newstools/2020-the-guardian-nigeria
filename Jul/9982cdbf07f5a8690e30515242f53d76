Nigeria has been urged to diversify its revenue base to protect its fiscal policies from external shocks.
 
Experts noted that as the country recently kicked off a 2021-2025 development plan intended to succeed the Vision 2020, and economic recovery growth plan (ERGP), its fiscal sustainability is expected to play a huge role in the new dispensation, given the current economic challenges brought about by the outbreak of the global COVID-19 pandemic.
 
At a webinar-based meeting organised by the Nigeria Fiscal Policy Roundtable (FPR) of the Nigerian Economic Summit Group (NESG), themed, “Nigeria’s Fiscal Sustainability: Imperatives, Impediments and Options,” NESG Board Chairman, Asue Ighodalo, stressed the need for the country to enhance its fiscal policies for economic growth.
 
He noted that the nationwide tax survey conducted by the FPR has contributed to the enhancement of the nation’s fiscal processes, just as the Finance Act, creation of a favourable threshold to optimise tax collection, and reduction of the tax burden on the society’s financially-disadvantaged will help to improve the economy and cushion the effects of the taxes.  Special Adviser to President Muhammadu Buhari on Finance and Economy, Dr. Sarah Alade, who represented the Minister for Finance, Zainab Ahmed, said Nigeria is still grappling with low revenue.
 
She added that the COVID-19 pandemic and the inherent lockdown meant that the GDP would, in its best-case scenario, contract by four per cent, and in the worst-case scenario contract by eight per cent.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
