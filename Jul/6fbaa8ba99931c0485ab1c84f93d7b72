Coronavirus infections are rising rapidly, reaching 1,089 cases including 20 fatalities, according to official figures. “We are finding it difficult to continue offering services in our work stations because of a number of challenges… for which no solution has been proffered,” the Zimbabwe Senior Hospital Doctors’ Association said.
