 Chemical workers in front of Nycil, in sango ota, ogun State, protesting against the lockout by the management, last week.  The President of NUCFRLANMPE, Goke Olatunji, said the firm failed to negotiate with the union based on collective and procedural agreement.
 
He advised the workers not vacate the premises and ensure that their right was granted even if the company would fold up. 
 
In his reaction, the Managing Director of Nycil, Badmus Abudu, said the management decided to lock out the workers to forestall violence.
 
He said the management was open to the peaceful resolution of the crisis, and as such, would be meeting with the top board members to decide on the way forward.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
