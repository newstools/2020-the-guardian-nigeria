This international recognition is a significant testimony of our solid financial fundamentals and our continuous commitment to offer quality products and services to our customers and to support them, in a difficult context created by the Covid-19 pandemic. This award also demonstrates that we are an institution recognized and respected regionally and internationally. I dedicate this distinction to all our customers as well as to our employees, without whom this success would not have been possible year after year. “  Distributed by APO Group on behalf of The Mauritius Commercial Bank Ltd (MCB).
