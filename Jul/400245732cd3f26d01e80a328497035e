The Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) has given the all-clear to two airline operators to hit the skies after fulfilling all health protocols and aviation guidelines as Mallam Aminu Kano International Airport (MAKIA), Kano restarts domestic flight operations today. The Guardian learnt that the two operators, Azman and Max Air received their restart plan approval for commercial flights on Thursday and scheduled their inaugural flight for Lagos to Abuja and Abuja to Kano today. The duo joined Air Peace, Aero Contractors and Arik to resume flights to Kano, Port Harcourt and Owerri today. In a letter of restart plan approval signed by NCAA Director-General, operations and obtained by The Guardian, the NCAA confirmed Azman complied with the provision of AOL of 5th, May, with ref. (DG13/20) and advisory circular NCAA-AC-FSG-001 on post-COVID-19 restart guidelines as well as health protocol, thereby authorized to resume operations. Managing director, Azman air, Faisal Abdulmunaf told The Guardian that Azman was 100 percent reinvigorated to embark on the new normal operations despite the huge impact of COVID-19 on the industry, adding that all staff are being recalled to resume their duties. While lamenting huge economic loss occasioned by the lockdown, Abdulmunaf canvassed for quick disbursement of the N25billion aviation intervention pledged by the Federal government to ease the massive manpower retrenchment in the sector. Regional manager Max air-limited, Sule Arome told The Guardian that they have met NCAAâ€™s requirements and normal flight operations will restart on Wednesday.
