Kekemeke, who speak with journalists yesterday during the primary election held at the International Culture and Events Center (The Dome), Akure, lamented that the election committee was not fair to the aspirants.

Three out of the 11 governorship aspirants stepped down to support Akeredolu few hours to the poll, while Awodeyi Akinsehinwa, Bukola Adetula, Sola Iji, Olusola Oke, Jumoke Anifowoshe and Olayide Adelami took part in the poll.
