Chairman, Panel of Inquiry on the Local Government administration in Imo State from May 29, 2011 through May 29, 2019, Eze Duruiheoma (SAN), has said that over N141 billion received by Rochas Okorocha, could not be accounted for during the panel’s sitting. Duruiheoma, who is the immediate past chairman of the National Population Commission (NPC), disclosed this in Owerri while submitting the report of the panel to Governor Hope Uzodimma. He told the governor that despite efforts made by some persons to frustrate their sittings, they uncovered unimaginable funny projects awarded within the period, regretting that the local government system, which was designed to be a level of grassroots development, saw to the alleged criminal diversion of funds within the period under review. Duruiheoma, disclosed that their findings showed that the commissioners of local government and chieftaincy affairs, councils’ chairmen and contractors who served within the period were allegedly involved in squandering colossal sums of allocations that were received, urging the governor to take steps to implement their recommendations. Also, the governor received the report of the Prof. Ukachukwu Awuzie-led panel on establishment and take-off of the Imo State University of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences and the Imo State Polytechnic relocation.
