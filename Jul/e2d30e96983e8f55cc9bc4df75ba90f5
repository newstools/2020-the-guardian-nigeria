The Nigeria Table Tennis Federation (NTTF) President, Ishaku Tikon, is thrilled by the recent feats of Aruna Quadri and Bode Abiodun, who won the Portuguese league title with their club. Africa’s top ranked player, Quadri and compatriot, Abiodun helped Sporting Lisbon to their 37th title, after defeating GD Toledos 3-0 in the two-leg final of the Portuguese National League, held at the High Performance Centre of Vila Nova de Gaia. Speaking to The Guardian, Tikon, who said every member of the NTTF was delighted by the duo’s feat, added that aside the title, Quadri was also leaving behind a record as he moves on to a new club in Germany. “Members of the NTTF board, players and coaches are happy with the duo. Everybody is happy that Quadri is even going back to play in the Bundesliga league, which is one of the toughest in Europe. “Quadri has also set a record and he is leaving the record behind. His club has been dominating the Portuguese league all this while. It is a thing of joy that at the point that he is leaving for Germany, he set the same record. So, it’s something we are very happy with,” he stated. Speaking on his fifth title achieved alongside with Portuguese international, Diogo Carvalho, Quadri said: “One more time, we are champions of Portugal. After a good five years playing for Sporting, this is my last match for Sporting and I am very happy with my stay with the club.
“I want to thank the doctors, president, physiotherapists, teammates, coaches and fans, as well as supporters for the unlimited support.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
