• Cases Rise To 84 The Secretary to the State Government and Chairman, Task Force on COVID-19 in Adamawa State, Alhaji Bashiru Ahmad, has raised the alarm that testing kits have been exhausted and that if the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) did not take urgent steps to supply more to the state, suspected cases wouldn’t undergo any test again. Bashiru said: “As from Sunday (today), if NCDC does not respond quickly to our request, there will be no testing kits in the state. With the rising cases of Coronavirus, we need more testing kits.” He said as at July 1, there were 84 recorded cases, 46 discharged and six dead. He advised the public to GO for testing, if they experience symptoms. He commended the Federal Government for approving testing centre at the Federal Medical Centre (FMC), Yola, AS it has reduced the cost of taking samples to Abuja every two days. He dismissed rumours that schools in the state would reopen this month, saying all schools remained closed indefinitely until there were medical evidences that the pandemic spread has dropped to a reasonable level. Bashiru, who spoke to The Guardian, said Federal Government’s pronouncement was misinterpreted by the people, pointing out that only final-year students would return for final year examinations. He said: “It is only JSS3, SSS3 and Primary 6 pupils that will resume writing their final examinations. any private school that violates this order would face the full wrath of the law.” Meanwhile, one testing kit, he said cost between N80,000 to N120,000.
