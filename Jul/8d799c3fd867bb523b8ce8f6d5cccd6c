 Ayuba Wabba  Labour leaders have called for a united force to reposition the movement to resist anti-worker policies, especially at critical times like this when the nation needs forthright, focused and incorruptible leadership.
 
They argued that the return to a stronger undivided voice could only serve to enhance the strategic position that the labour movement holds in the tripartite and the nation in general.  He said: “Labour activism is not about what you get; it is about what you give. Capitalists are uniting everywhere in the world; workers also have to unite. For me, we have to come together so that we can be a formidable force to confront the bourgeoisies in government. Until labour speaks with one indivisible voice, we will not get to the promised land.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
