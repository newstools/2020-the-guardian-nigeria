Former Green Eagles winger, Adegoke Adelabu, says the five-year deal sealed by Super Eagles striker, Victor Osimhen, with Italian club Napoli, is a big advertisement for Nigeria. Lille will pocket €70 million in the first year, which could rise to €80 million based on performance-related add-ons. Italian daily, Tuttomercarto tweeted in the early hours of yesterday: “All of the paperwork and contracts have been signed for Victor Osimhen’s move to Napoli. All that’s left to do now is the announcement.” Osimhen’s €70million deal with Napoli is the most expensive signing in the history of the club and the highest transfer deal of the summer so far. It is also the highest in African football history, as it stands €1million more than the African record transfer fee Arsenal paid Lille for Cote d’Ivoire international Nicolas Pepe last summer. Speaking with The Guardian yesterday, Adelabu, a sports scientist and former manager of Eko United FC of Lagos said: “We need more of the  Osimhens from Nigerian football. For the past few weeks, all major talks in football around the world are about Osimhen. You can imagine if we can produce more of such players from our league. It will transform the country. “When we talk of Brazil as a nation, what comes to the mind is the large turn over of quality footballers from the country to the rest of the world. I congratulate Osimhen for this record move to Napoli, but I will also advice him to maintain his high profile, and be a good ambassador of Nigeria in Napoli,” Adelabu stated. Osimhen, who played only 45 minutes for the Super Eagles in their third place match against Tunisia at Egypt 2019 AFCON, scored 18 goals in 32 games for French club Lille. An official announcement of Osimhen’s departure to Napoli was being expected from Lille as at the time of this report yesterday. Osimhen will wear jersey No.9 at Napoli next season.
