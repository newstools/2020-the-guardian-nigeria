These trends became more during the coronavirus period, more out of boredom. However, a new trend has emerged from the depths of social media, which has users posting black and white photos, along with the phrase “challenge accepted” or the hashtag #ChallengeAccepted, in the caption. The question that keeps popping up is what the challenge is about and why now. A need for positivity in these dark times has inspired Instagram to bring back an old Instagram challenge from 2016 called the Black and White Challenge, according to Hit C. Originally, the point was to raise cancer awareness, but now, it is used for advocating for female empowerment. The end result is to make Instagram a safe and positive space for those who need it most right now, and for women to appreciate each other’s beauty.   . When we see so much negativity around us, let’s build positivity. As women, let’s push ourselves up rather than pulling each other down. Challenge accepted! @antara_m @kanchan_k_desai A post shared by  Tina Ambani (@tinaambaniofficial) on Jul 26, 2020 at 8:54pm PDT  So you can jump on the challenge and tag the women you appreciate, it is women empowerment month and you should appreciate the women in your life too!
