Former Super Eagles defender, Ifeanyi Udeze, believes Victor Osimhen’s move from Lille FC of France to top Italian club, Napoli, is crucial in the national team striker’s career. Udeze, who said the move would either make or mar his career, commended the striker for big strides he has made in his nascent career. He said Osimhen’s next task is to earn a first team shirt in Napoli, adding that diligence and dedication will make him a success in Napoli. The ex-Poak of Greece defender advised Osimhen against complacency, saying that the young striker still has a lot to prove in world football. He said, “Osimhen should realise that signing for Napoli is a new dawn for him in football. In fact, he should see this contract as his foray into the highest level of football, especially in Italy, where everything is tough and competitive. “Osimhen should work hard to earn a first team shirt. If he does not play regularly at Napoli, his value will drop and it will affect other top clubs from coming for him in future. But playing regularly for club and country will entice bigger clubs to come for him,” he said. Last week Napoli agreed an initial 60 million euros deal with Lille for Osimhen.
