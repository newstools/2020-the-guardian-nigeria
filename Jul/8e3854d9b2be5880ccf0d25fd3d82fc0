• Despite partial closure, 75% regular users to ply bridge, says Sanwo-Olu
• Be patient, cooperate with traffic managers, RTEAN urges members It was a dress rehearsal yesterday, on the Third Mainland Bridge, of the hassles to come in the next six months, as the longest bridge in West Africa will be partially shut for repairs begining today and for 180 days by the Federal Ministry of Works to fix worn out expansion joints.
 
By midday, a viral post by Felix Adebayo on Twitter had spent panic shivers down the spine of motorists. The tweet read: “Please avoid Third Mainland Bridge into the island if you can. It is heavily blocked at the moment. This is how it has been since Monday and this is how it will be for another six months. Meanwhile, Costain into the island is not better either.”
 
The traffic was hellish all through the day from UNILAG waterfront inward the island due to ongoing diversion being put up ahead of repairs at Adeniji end of the bridge. It was the same at the alternative route in Onipanu, Jibowu, Mushin and Ojuelegba yesterday.  “I understand that they are trying to maintain the bridge, but we had about two months of total lockdown and partial lockdown for some weeks more and it was never considered to carry out this repair when traffic on the roads was minimal. It is now when activities are back in full swing that they are willing to close down the bridge on the major link route between the island and the mainland.
 
“Thinking of the alternative route is even torture to the mind. What alternative means of transport is available apart from the roads? The waterways option is not reliable with frequent boat accidents. There is no effective train system and BRT buses are not enough for the population of Lagos. The next six months would be a terrible experience for many Lagosians. Thankfully, the pandemic has shown us we can do business activities over the internet, which many companies are already practicing,” he said.
 
Babatunde Kayode said: “It is a good thing to fix the bridge because of how dangerous it could be for us, but what plans has the government put in place to ensure smooth flow of traffic for the next six months? I spend an average of one hour thirty minutes getting to the office from Surulere passing through Western Avenue and I ask myself, Third Mainland Bridge has not been closed yet; what now happens when the bridge is closed?
 
“The only thing I will say is that the closure of the bridge is for good, but my fear is the planning. If the government is not making any plan to control the activities of truck and tanker drivers on the alternative routes, then the closure of the Third Mainland Bridge will be a disaster.”
 
Some road transport workers have warned passengers to brace up for the worst as many workers who may wish to use public transport may resume work by 1:00p.m. instead of 9/10:00a.m. Kamoru Gbadamosi, a transport operator in Oshodi, said the maintenance of the bridge would reduce the trips of buses, increase the cost of transport and leave many passengers stranded at bus stops, which will make many commuters resume work late.
 
“For the good of our passengers, I will advise those who will like to get to work before 12noon or 1:00p.m. from Friday to be at the bus terminal by 4:00a.m. to avoid stories that touch,” he said with a tone of sarcasm, adding that there was need for the government to review the 4:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. curfew as it will cause a great challenge to both commuters and drivers who may wish to leave home before cockcrow or stay back till late night. But the Lagos State governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, yesterday said despite the partial closure of the bridge, 75 to 80 per cent of road users who often ply the route would still be able to use it. Speaking when the Sector Commander, Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) in Lagos, Olusegun Ogungbemide and State Commandant, Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), Adeyinka Fasiu Ayinla, paid him a courtesy visit, Sanwo-Olu said only 25 per cent of road users who often ply the route would need to use alternative routes.  According to him, transporters must do everything possible to be patient and cooperate with all traffic officers to ensure free flow of traffic.The RTEAN boss said: “All of us know how important the bridge is to us. We know there will be heavy traffic. In fact, it will be serious, but we have informed our members to be law-abiding. We have told our members to be patient and cooperate with Lagos State Traffic Management Authority (LASTMA), Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), police and other law enforcement agencies.”He urged the union members and their employees to always drive with care and obey all the COVID-19 protocols as it relates to public transport in the state.
