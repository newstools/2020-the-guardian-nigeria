The Nigerian Armed Forces Resettlement Centre Officers’ Wives Association (NAFRCOWA) has extended cash and food items as palliatives to the underprivileged in the armed forces resettlement community and environs. Over 200 beneficiaries went home with cartons of noodles, rice, beans, and vegetable oil. Coordinator of the association, Mrs Sheila Lar, said the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic had caused severe strain on individuals, government and corporations’ finances. “Everybody is affected. It is just the severity that differs and the inability of people to remain indoors or restrict social interaction due to economic activities has caused the increase in the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases. “Many Nigerians depend on daily income and the Federal Government’s safety protocols will be a tough one to abide by since staying indoors is the safest bet to curb the spread of the virus. As an association, we decided to make life easy for people around us to ease their plight during this difficult moment in history. “We carried out a survey and the result showed that the most affected people are orphans and widows. That is the reason we are reaching out to them.” Sheila urged the beneficiaries to take the precautionary measures and shun social gatherings to remain safe.
