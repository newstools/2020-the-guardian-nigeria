Apex Igbo Socio-cultural organization, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, is not new to the crisis. The umbrella organization, which exists as a united platform to speak for Ndigbo, has had its fair share of squabbles since 1976 when it was founded.
 
It could be said that no year had passed in the lifespan of the organization without issues, such as rightful headship, tenure of elected officials among others, troubling the body.  While some of these issues were resolved through the intervention of elders and political stakeholders, others had gone through litigation at various courts.
   
It was not therefore a surprise two weeks ago, when report of another crisis broke. Leading the way in the current imbroglio is the traditional ruler of Igbariam community, Anambra East Council, Igwe Nkeli Nzekwe.  “The very first chairman was Dr. Akanu Ibiam, the Secretary was Chief Jerome Udorji, the Vice Chairman was Justice Daddy Onyeama and the Assistant Secretary was Chief J.U Agwu, my uncle, who invited me and I became part of that history. I am in my late sixties now, but I was a young man running errands for them then. Where was Igwe Kelly in 1976? He was a trader somewhere in Lagos. Let him state where the Ohanaeze meeting was held in 1976?”
   
Okorie explained that founders of Ohanaeze deliberately refused to register the organization with the CAC because, “they did not want Ohanaeze to become a certificated body, which somebody could one day rise up and withdraw the certificate.”
   
Consequently, Okorie warned: “Ohanaeze has become spiritual and is the umbrella union of the entire Igbo people. Anybody tampering with it is endangering his life and the life of his generation. If the proponents of the new group want to be useful to Ndigbo, they can go and form another association, but not with the name Ohanaeze Ndigbo.”
   
A former governor of Anambra State, Dr. Chukwuemeka Ezeife, berated promoters of the new group. “It is wrong and it is shameful.  I am part of the elders’ forum and I want to tell you that this is a sign of rascality. It is a ploy to destabilize Igbo. I believe they want money to destabilize Ohanaeze and Igbo interests,” he said. Emeritus President General of Aka Ikenga, Chief Goddy Uwazuruike, said Ohanaeze had one president general worldwide in Nnia Nwodo, adding however that the attempt to split the group was to truncate the national election that would produce somebody from Imo State as Nwodo’s successor in January next year.  CAC’s Aboutface
IRRITATED by the scale of condemnations of its action and that of the new group, the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC), announced the withdrawal of the certificate it issued the new group. The Commission in a statement said the certificate was issued in error and asked those parading it to return the same to it.
   
“This is to inform members of the general public that the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) has withdrawn the registration certificate with No.144918 inadvertently issued to the Trustees of Ohanaeze Ndigbo General Assembly.
 
“The trustees of the association have been advised to return the said certificate to the commission as the same has been canceled. The conditions for the issuance of the certificate have not been fully fulfilled,” CAC stated.
   
Although the promoters of the group have threatened litigation over the stand of the commission, this is not however the first time the Nwodo-leadership of Ohanaeze Ndigbo has been attacked since its emergence three years ago.
   
Nwodo’s executive would quit office in January next year. In line with the rotational arrangement in Ohanaeze Ndigbo, the office of the President General would move to Imo state among others. Past Breaches
The first attack the Nwodo leadership of Ohanaeze faced was the refusal by a former president of the youth wing, Okechukwu Isiguzoro, to hand over after his tenure elapsed and a new leadership under Arthur Obioha was elected.
