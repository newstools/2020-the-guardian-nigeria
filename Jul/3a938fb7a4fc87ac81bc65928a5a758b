The club also planted some trees at the PHC. According to Oyebade, Rotary Club is committed to improving the lives of the common people. Speaking on the tree planting and other projects by the club,  he said: “Tree planting supports our oxygen. We should not allow our environment to go deserted and that is why we need to plant trees, not only in July, which is the specific month for tree planting, but all year round. “This particular facility has been desolate for a while and what the Rotary Club of Falomo has done is to identify the facility and revamp it for the benefit of humanity. They have lit a light rather than wait in the dark.” President of the club, Mr Peter Nwaochei, urged Nigerians to observe all the safety protocols to prevent the further spread of COVID-19. “It is only an individual who is alive that can do business. Nigerians should please stay alive to do that business, make that money and eat good food. COVID-19 is not a fluke; it is real. It is very key that everybody stay safe. Don’t believe what people are saying that it is a scam. People are dying in their numbers. The media is under-reporting the deaths.” The Acting MOH, Eti-Osa LCDA, Dr Babalola Oluwatobi, thanked the club for resuscitating the PHC. He said: “If you look at the pre and post-pictures of this place, you will discover that there is a significant change, and what this just tells us is that simple maintenance would go a long way in making a facility to be beautiful and would also increase its accessibility. “With the assistance of the officer in charge of this place and then with my supervisory role, we would always keep maintaining the facilities.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
