  Cristiano Ronaldo and his teammates this season wore a half-and-half jersey with white on the right and black on the left. “Tradition is represented by the return of the black and white stripes which present themselves in a new and more modern form,” Juventus said. The stripes are black “brush strokes” of an artist on a white background, with the club logo and sponsorship details in gold. “The stripes are designed as a single brush stroke on the front and the sleeves, giving the kit a new and attractive design, all while maintaining the DNA of the club as well as showcasing the beginning of a new era.” Juventus sealed their 36th Serie A title, and ninth in succession, last weekend. The club was founded in 1897, but players have worn black and white stripes of various types since 1903. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
