Mountain of Fire Ministries (MFM) Football Club of Lagos Coach, Tony Bolus, has started training his players online ahead of the 2020/2021 season scheduled to kick off in September. Following the nationwide lockdown, which has forced the suspension of all sporting activities, clubs can only train virtually in accordance to the COVID-19 safety protocol. Bolus explained that the online training has become necessary in MFM’s bid to keep the team in top shape ahead of the 2020/2021 season, adding that the technical crew and players are looking forward to the resumption of the league as announced by the League Management Company (LMC) recently. “It is dangerous not to keep the players mentally busy during this lockdown. Although the technical lessons are not enough, it is important that we keep the players focused so and in top form for the task ahead,” he said.
