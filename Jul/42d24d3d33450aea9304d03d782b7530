President Muhammadu Buhari has described the death of philanthropist and entrepreneur, High Chief Bode Akindele, as an irreparable loss to the country. The President, in a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Mr. Femi Adesina, said the late industrialist was one of the early groups of private individuals to support government intervention in the fight against the COVID-19 scourge, donating handsomely to the fund. “Chief Akindele was a man of many parts. He was a creator of jobs who demonstrated untiring love for the down-trodden. His philanthropic gestures knew no bounds, intervening especially in critical sectors of the economy,” President Buhari said. He condoled with the government and people of Oyo State, particularly the Olubadan-In-Council, on the loss of the Parakoyi of Ibadanland whose immeasurable contributions to development and progress of his community and country remained paramount till the very end. Buhari also commiserated with the Organised Private Sector on the departure of a key member whose imprints in various sectors will remain indelible.He urged family members, friends and associates to take solace in the fact that Chief Akindele touched lives, wrote his name in gold, and lived a life of accomplishments. He prayed that God would grant him eternal rest. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
