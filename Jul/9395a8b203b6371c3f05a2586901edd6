Commenting on the TMC season 3, Bola Atta, Executive Director, REDTV and Group Director, Corporate Communications at UBA Plc, in a chat yesterday expressed delight in being able to “wear several hats” in her role at UBA, one of them being an Executive Producer for REDTV, with TV production as her passion.
 
Shedding light on the latest season, the corporate amazon said: “The Men’s Club is a series about four young men, Aminu, Tayo, Lanre and Louis, who are navigating life, winding through several relationships, breaking hearts and getting hearts broken. Now in its third season, completing filming, which began pre-pandemic, is a learning process itself. Cast and crew were tested for COVID-19 and when thankfully they all tested negative, were placed in residence (of maximum 20 persons).
 
“Following strict protocols for sanitisation and distancing on set while disinfecting every day, it wasn’t easy, but we got it done,” she said.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
