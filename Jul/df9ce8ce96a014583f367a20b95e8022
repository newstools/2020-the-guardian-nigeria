Prof. Lai Olurode of the University of Lagos and Dr. Arthur-Martins Aginam of Baze University, Abuja, have blamed the country’s deteriorating socio-economic situation on the failure of politicians and their parties to consider the interest of the people when making policies. The duo was reacting to the ruling All Progressive Grand Alliance’s insistence on the zoning of the 2021 Anambra State governorship to the southern part of the state. Aginam lamented that ethnic considerations rather merit were being considered by the political class in policymaking. Olurode expressed regrets for a lack of political ideology in the country. He said: “There is so much deficit of trust and integrity in the political parties. Floor members’ voices have  since been drowned out, while a genuine love of ideology and principles are gone and preference aggregation sacrificed.” Meanwhile, an opinion poll conducted by Media Awareness and Development Advocacy Forum on the governorship election is s against the zoning arrangement. In its report at the weekend, MADAF said voters were against the move. “Zoning is not just inconsequential but very unpopular among the electorate in the state, the zoning narrative in Anambra State is an elitist agenda aimed mainly at a power grab, “ the report said. It added: “The method of data gathering was qualitative: using a questionnaire and one-on-interview, asking selected people in the state to respond to the questions. In all, our researchers interviewed 5, 211 people across the three senatorial districts.” The group said it discovered that the zoning issue was  ‘’irrelevant and unpopular’’ among voters. The report said, “The majority of the citizens and the electorate are looking up to credible candidates in the governorship election for good governance,  address the issues of insecurity, youth unemployment,  poverty and others.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
