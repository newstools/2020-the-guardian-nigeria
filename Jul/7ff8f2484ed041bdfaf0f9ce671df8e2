Former international, Friday Elaho, has advised Nigerian footballers aspiring for greatness to emulate Victor Osimhen, by working hard and adhering to healthy practices if they desired to break into the big league. Elaho, who said Osimhen has become a hot cake in Europe due to his diligence and humility, believes other Nigerian youths can also reach the same height if they emulate the Lille of France striker. Lille President, Gerard Lopez, on Monday disclosed that the club was still receiving offers for Osimhen, despite reaching an advanced agreement to sell the former Golden Eaglet to Gennaro Gattuso-led Naples in a deal reported to be worth between €60m and €80m. Speaking with The Guardian yesterday, Elaho said he was excited that Osimhen was attracting the top clubs in Europe, adding that the news about Osimhen will boost the country’s hope of qualifying for the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) and the World Cup. “I have been following the news about Osimhen going to Napoli, but I don’t know why the deal hasn’t been confirmed yet. Again, I think Osimhen has done well for himself and the country. Currently, he is the most rated Nigerian player in Europe. Other players I think should emulate him. “I read recently that he changed his manager for his move to Napoli scale through. If his club is still reporting that some clubs are still coming for his signature despite his almost completed negotiations with Lille, it shows how good and important he is rated,” Elaho said. The former ACB winger added, “Very soon the AFCON and World Cup qualifiers will begin, definitely Osimhen has a pivotal role to play towards Nigeria’s qualification for the tournaments. I see him winning the Africa Footballer of the Year in the nearest future if he can maintain his form. Others should brace up to the challenge,” he stated.
