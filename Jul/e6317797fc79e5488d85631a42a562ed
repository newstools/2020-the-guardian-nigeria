Lewis Hamilton took a knee in support of the Black Lives Matter campaign and Formula One’s “End Racism” stance on Sunday during another chaotic pre-race gesture by drivers ahead of the Hungarian Grand Prix. According to the limited television pictures broadcast of the drivers’ gesture, it appeared that only around 16 took a knee with Hamilton wearing a Black Lives Matter t-shirt and the rest in “End Racism” garments. After the muddled arrangements for the statement to be made ahead of the season-opening Austrian and Styrian Grands Prix, this risks being seen as another example of the lack of unity among the drivers in their support for the Black Lives Matter cause. Drivers assembled just minutes after Max Verstappen had crashed his Red Bull on the way to the grid, hitting the barriers little more than 15 minutes before the race start.
