The Acting chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) Ibrahim Magu has been invited before a panel probing the activities of the agency. The panel is reportedly sitting at the Banquet Hall wing of the Presidential Villa. Magu was stopped in traffic while moving out of the Wuse II Annex of the EFCC in Abuja and the invitation was extended to him. Although Magu was on his way to the Force Headquarters and pleaded with an officer from FCID who met with him to honour the scheduled appointment. But he was told the invitation by the panel was more important. At about 1.35pm, Magu arrived at the Villa where he was ushered into the wing. Magu has been joined at the Villa by his lawyer, Mr. Rotimi Jacobs as the time of filing this report. A source said, “Both Magu and Jacobs are now in an office in the Banquet Wing of the Vila. “He has not been arrested by any of the security agencies. We are awaiting further development.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
