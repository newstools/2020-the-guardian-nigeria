Beatrice, 31 and Italian property developer Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, 37, tied the knot in an unannounced ceremony with Queen Elizabeth II in attendance, along with a small number of guests. The couple had been due to marry earlier in May but the event was postponed due to the coronavirus outbreak and no rescheduled date was given. Buckingham Palace confirmed the secret ceremony: “The private wedding ceremony of Princess Beatrice and Mr Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi took place at 11:00 am (1000 GMT) on Friday 17th July, at the Royal Chapel of All Saints at Royal Lodge, Windsor,” the royal family said in a statement. The statement added that the event was attended by the Queen, 94, and her 99-year-old husband who have been self-isolating at the castle because their age puts them in a high-risk category for coronavirus. “The small ceremony was attended by the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh (Prince Philip) and close family. The wedding took place in accordance with all relevant government guidelines.” Beatrice and her sister Eugenie, 30, are the daughters of Andrew and his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson. Both attended the ceremony, as did the groom’s parents, reports said. Prince Andrew is the third child and second son of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip. Andrew stepped back from frontline royal duties last year after he caused outrage in a television interview by defending his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, the late American financier and convicted sex offender. Epstein was found dead in prison last year as he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges. Andrew, 60, has denied claims that he had sex with a 17-year-old girl trafficked by Epstein. US investigators are keen to speak to the prince about his links to Epstein, after the arrest of British socialite
Ghislaine Maxwell on sex trafficking charges.
