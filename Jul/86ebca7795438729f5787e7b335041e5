The Governor, Lions Club International, District 404A1, Mr Tokunbo Aromolaran, has expressed concern over the escalating rate of diseases such as diabetics, vision impairments, poverty and hunger-induced sicknesses and cancer among Nigerians. Aromolaran, who spoke during his induction in Lagos, said it was unfortunate that the harsh economic situation in the country is biting hard on citizens, worsening their health conditions.He, therefore, called on well-meaning Nigerians to give back to the society by helping the masses in area of poverty alleviation. “As a club, we are contributing our quota by rolling out an initiative where about a million Nigerians would benefit from the Lions Club International vision restoration project, with the primary aim of arresting preventable blindness and encompassing the full spectrum of management of eyesight.” Aromolaran disclosed that the club had already donated protective gears worth $10,000 to the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), while all the 104 clubs in the district had also made donation of various equipment for fighting COVID-19 to healthcare centres and groups in their communities.
