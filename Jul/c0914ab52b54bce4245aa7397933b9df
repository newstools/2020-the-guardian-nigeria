Leaders of the Igbo women community defected to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) from the All Progressives Congress (APC) at the state secretariat of the PDP in Benin City. The state’s PDP Women Leader, Lindsay Sorea, received the women, who were led by Blessing Ahoruonye in Benin City, the Edo State capital. Ahoruonye said they were joining the PDP so they can offer maximum support to Governor Obaseki in appreciation of the excellent work he is doing. She recalled the elimination of double taxation by thugs in the previous APC government, which has brought relief to them. She commended the impressive development in the state as well as the economic expansion that has positively influenced the rate of consumption and his prudent management of resources informed their decision to join the PDP. She expressed fear that if Governor Obaseki’s administration is disrupted, they believe the state would go back to the “hands of thugs, brutal tax collectors and servicing of godfathers at the detriment of development and ease of doing business.” Ahoruonye cautioned against the return of the state to a party immersed in corruption while citing recent NDDC and EFCC allegations among others. She affirmed that they have vowed to vote for PDP and Governor Obaseki to ensure that the train is not derailed. “We the Igbo community in Edo state have realized our past mistakes and we are fully ready to correct it this time by voting PDP,” Ahoruonye said.
