The winner, Nwafor Akunna Claire, is an indigene of Umuoye, Agbogugu in Awgu Local Government, Enugu State who is beyond beauty and talents but also an embodiment of strength and humility. Nwafor, the fourth out of six siblings, is a lawyer and a student of History and International Relations at Nnamdi Azikiwe University(UNIZIK) Awka. She said she was able to emerge winner in the talent hunt by applying her creativity and originality in delivering her art. Nwafor promised to give back to the society as she looks forward to completing a Resource Center for her Foundation ROCC Africa which she started in 2019 at Ugbo-Odogwu, Transekulu Enugu. “I have learnt yet again, that consistency and confidence are vital spices to greatness and I intend leveraging on this duo to achieve my goals. My plan is simply to get the best out of my self and everyone I am able to reach through the process of expressing my Art,” Nwafor said. Reacting to the recent Nwafor’s win, the visioner of Spangler Got Talent Hunt 2020 and the executive director of Spangler, Purity Abhulimhen, explained that the initiative will not be hindered by the coronavirus pandemic. “Amidst the pandemic, our team needed to keep activities rolling in. We had to speak with likeminded individuals as well as organisations who saw beyond the pandemic to organise a virtual Talent Hunt show. We have through it brought lots of talents to the limelight. We feel fulfilled thus far and can’t wait to do more,” Abhulimhen added. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
