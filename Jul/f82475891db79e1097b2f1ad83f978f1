A group, Northern Professionals resident in Edo, yesterday, pledged their support for the Edo State All Progressives Congress’ (APC) gubernatorial candidate, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, boasting that with the support of Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, as party’s campaign council chairman, victory is sure for the party. A statement by the group’s chairman, Abdallah Tureta, said: “We, Northern Professionals resident in Edo, have resolved to throw our weight behind the APC gubernatorial candidate, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu. We are assuring him of our collective support to ensure his victory at the polls in September. “Our resolve to back Ize-Iyamu is in solidarity with Governor Ganduje appointed as the chairman of the campaign council. “It is extremely important to say that our support for Ize-Iyamu is largely because of the chairmanship of one of our performing governors from the North, in person of Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
