A social and professional group in Ogun State, the Abeokuta Club, has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to devolve powers to the regions of the federation to enhance productivity, efficiency and optimal benefits to citizens. The group also implored the President to devolve authority on security, land, solid minerals, inland waterways, agriculture and education to regional units, insisting that these sectors are closer to the people and should be left in the hands of authorities closer to them. This position formed part of the communique issued at the end of Sobo Sowemimo yearly lecture of the club in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital. The club, in the communique signed by its President, Tokunbo Odebunmimade, and made available to journalists yesterday, opined that the Federal Government should concentrate more on defence, foreign affairs, aviation and air-space control, marine boundaries, international relations and international trade. The communique recommended that the government should cede to the regional units matters such as higher education, internal trade, research and development, science, technology and innovation and other issues that would be better enhanced through regional structures. It also urged the federal and state governments to promote togetherness of the people of Nigeria in manners devoid of domineering spirit or tendencies, disregard or disrespect of any component and with observance of, and respect for the fundamental human rights.
