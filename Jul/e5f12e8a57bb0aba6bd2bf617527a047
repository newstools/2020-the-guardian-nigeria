Ayodele furthermore called on customers within IBEDC’s network to stay clear of snapped power wires and cables, sagging lines and fallen poles, and advised customers to call its official lines if any such incident occurred, or report through the DisCo’s social media handles immediately, while maintaining a safe distance from the point of the accident.
