The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has urged the public to take an active part in the vetting of the list and particulars of nominated candidates for the Ondo State governorship election to enhance transparency in the nomination processes. The INEC, in a statement signed by its National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye, said that the list and personal particulars of the candidates as submitted by the 17 political parties would be uploaded on its website and published in the commission’s state office in Akure, Ondo State on Friday, July 31, 2020. Okoye added that the list would also be published on the commission’s social media platforms on the same day. He said: “The list and personal particulars of the candidates as submitted by the 17 political parties will be uploaded on our website and published in our state office in Akure, Ondo State, on Friday, July 31, 2020. This is in compliance with Section 31 (3) of the Electoral Act 2010 (as amended). The List will also be published on the commission’s social media platforms on the same day. “By Section 31 (5) & (6) of the Electoral Act, a person who has reasonable grounds to believe that any information given in the affidavit or any of the documents submitted by any of the candidates is false may file a suit in court seeking a declaration that such information is false. If the court determines that the information is false, the court shall issue an order disqualifying the candidate from contesting the election.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
