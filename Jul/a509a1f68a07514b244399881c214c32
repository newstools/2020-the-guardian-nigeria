National Chairman of African Democratic Congress (ADC) Chief Ralph Nwosu and a leader of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Dr. Emeka Kalu have kicked against the proposed vacation for judges from July to September 2020, saying that it is improper and ill-advised. They both contented that given the situation where the entire world has been on lockdown over coronavirus pandemic in the last three months, all should endeavor to make special sacrifices toward revamping the economy. Kalu said that because the pandemic had already taken over four months, disrupting the social and economic lives of the people, and stalling adjudication of justice by the learned judges, it was expected that there would be special consideration for pending cases. He insisted that going on vacation by the judges would amount to aiding corrupt individuals who might have been using court system to stall justice for the people who need it. “This will also further complicate issues in the country because cases slated to be handled were postponed because of the pandemic. Justice will be stalled for people that dearly seek it.” Nwosu appealed to the Federal Government to prevail on the judges to see reason they should not go on vacation now. “We have all stayed longer than necessary at home due to the pandemic and we cannot afford to entertain another vacation,” he said.
