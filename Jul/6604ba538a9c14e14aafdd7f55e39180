Concerned elders in Ilorin are worried over alleged rise in crime rates among youths in the ancient town of Ilorin, Kwara State. The development came on the heels of outbreak of hostilities among youths at ‘Alore’ part of the town, over an alleged increment in the cost of Cannabis sativa, ‘Igbo’ or ‘Weed’ in the area. The protesting youths, some of whom went berserk, two days ago, to register their anger by destroying unsuspecting residents’ property, allegedly conscripted sellers of the outlawed substance to reduce the cost. But former Secretary of the state branch of Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Dr. Olusola Ajolore and the Chief Imam of Ilorin, Alhaji Mohammed Bashir decried the sad development, attributing it to parents’ failure to impart  high moral standard in their children and wards. Ajolore told The Guardian: “The is sad. We need to react on time to avoid the spread of this bad habit among youths. These are our future, but they need to embrace Christ-like character, to make the town a peaceful one. Parents, in particular, should step up their responsibility to their children.” Bashir said:  “Ilorin was not like this in the past. Some of these youths are copying bad gangs and they need to tread softly. Parents should complement our efforts in this regard.” Reacting to the development, the state’s Police spokesman, Ajayi Okasanmi DSP, said the command was yet to be briefed of the development, but promised prompt action on anyone committing crime in any part of the town, to serve as a deterrent to others. Okasanmi, who described the relationship among the para- military bodies and the military in the state as cordial, said the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) officers would swing into action, “if, indeed, it is true.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
