The Private Schools Owners Association (APSON), yesterday, pleaded for extension of time to enable students adequately prepare for the West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE) holding on August 17,2020. The appeal followed the recent directive on reopening of schools on August 4 for exit classes to prepare the pupils for the test. The association, which is seeking four to six weeks, said more time for revision would better prepare the candidates for the external examination. In a statement by its Chairman and National Director of Administration, Bishop (Dr.) Goddy Opukeme, and Bishop Elakhe Imoukhed, respectively APSON stated: “These candidates have been out of school for over four months, during which time some have abandoned their books and have been engaged in economic activities to assist their parents. “The students, therefore, need a minimum of one month to readjust to school environment. “We wish to reiterate that to avoid mass failure, the students need between four and six weeks for effective revision as our people are used to the conventional schooling and are yet to fully come to term with e-learning.” The body said it had constituted a national COVID-19 committee ahead of resumption. The move, according to the proprietors, is to ensure the safety of students and teachers amid the pandemic. Assuring parents and government of their commitment to observance of the extant safety protocols of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and the Presidential Task Force (PTF), the association hinted that it had liaised with suppliers of personal protective equipment (PPE).
