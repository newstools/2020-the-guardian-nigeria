Swift, 30, surprised her fans on Thursday morning when she announced that she will be releasing her 8th studio album, “Folklore”, which she said was an album of songs she had poured all her “whims, dreams, fears, and musings” into. Speaking about the album, Swift said that the album was the result of her imagination running wild while in isolation: “In isolation my imagination has run wild and this album is the result, a collection of songs and stories that flowed like a stream of consciousness. Picking up a pen was my way of escaping into fantasy, history, and memory. I’ve told these stories to the best of my ability with all the love, wonder, and whimsy they deserve. Now it’s up to you to pass them down. folklore is out now.” Taylor Swift – Folklore | Image: Instagram/taylorswift “Folklore” comprises of 16 songs. On the album, Swift worked with producer and The National guitarist Aaron Dessner, who co-wrote or produced 11 of the 16 songs on the album, as well as Bon Iver, who co-wrote and sings on one of the tracks. William Bowery co-wrote two songs. Swift’s frequent collaborator producer/songwriter/singer Jack Antonoff, also joined forces with the singer once again for the new album. “I’ve poured all of my whims, dreams, fears, and musings into. Most of the things I had planned this summer didn’t end up happening, but there is something I hadn’t planned on that DID happen,” Swift said. “Before this year, I probably would’ve overthought when to release this music at the ‘perfect’ time, but the times we’re living in keep reminding me that nothing is guaranteed. “My gut is telling me that if you make something you love, you should just put it out into the world. That’s the side of uncertainty I can get on board with,” added the singer-songwriter.
