Ondo State Southern Senatorial Patriotic Movement (OSSSPM) has appealed to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship candidate, Mr. Eyitayo Jegede to pick the deputy governor of the State, Agboola Ajayi, as his running mate for the October 10, 2020 gubernatorial poll. In a statement by the group’s coordinator, Wale Edamisan, the group urged the national leaders of the party to rally round the deputy governor in this trying period. Edamisan, who noted that Ajayi is an asset to the party, warned that he shouldn’t be frustrated to an extent that he may take his exit. Ajayi, who decamped recently from the All Progressives Congress (APC), was the first runner-up in the just concluded PDP governorship primary election. The group explained that Jegede must understand that at this point, he needs a running mate that can muster enough votes for him and Ajayi is the only politician in the party from the south with such capacity.
