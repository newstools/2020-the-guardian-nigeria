Officials eased most virus restrictions in June ahead of a large military parade in Moscow and a nationwide vote on constitutional reforms that could extend Putin’s rule. “The number of coronavirus infections in Russia gradually decreased in June and July,” Putin said during a video conference with officials, adding that the number of new cases had halved since the peak in May. Yet Putin cautioned that, “the situation remains difficult — it could swing in any direction”. The president called on Russians to observe the rules in place to prevent the spread of the virus to avoid any need to “re-impose restrictions, especially large-scale ones”. It was important that “kindergartens, colleges, and organisations can work safely, in the regular manner to which people are accustomed”, he added. Russia shuttered businesses and imposed a strict lockdown in March to slow the outbreak which centred around Moscow where around half the cases were reported. Health officials on Wednesday reported 5,475 new cases in the country. A government tally during the peak of the epidemic in May reported more than 11,000 new cases. Only India, Brazil and the worst-hit country, the United States, have recorded higher total numbers of infections than Russia.
