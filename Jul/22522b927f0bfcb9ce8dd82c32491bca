Road users around Omole-Berger route in Lagos State have called on the police authorities to caution a officer controlling traffic around the axis who is fond of breaking the screen and side mirrors of vehicles at random while controlling traffic or attempting to extort motorists.    
 
According to a motorist who captured the police officer on camera at the weekend, his frequent acts had sent shivers down the spine of motorists who are at a loss as why he daily carries out his erratic acts.
 
While narrating the ordeal of motorists to The Guardian, a resident who pleaded for anonymity, said: “He uses big sticks on vehicles and cause a lot of panic and traffic just before the FRSC U-turn on the Ogba-Berger road.”
 
Another motorist, Emeka Onyeama, said: “He seems to enjoy carrying out jungle justice on motorists by breaking their side mirrors and glasses at random like a crazy man. Once you sight him, you are at a loss what to do because he is ready to damage your vehicle in a jiffy. Such an officer doing that with a stick would be a nemesis once he handles a gun.”
 
According to reports from motorists, he is said to be attached to a police station around Omole and Grammar School on the Omole-Berger route.In his reaction, the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) of the Lagos State Police Command, DSP Bala Elkana, assured motorists that further enquiries were ongoing to reveal the identity of the police officer.
 
“I sent the picture to both Isheri and Ojodu divisions. They don’t have such a person. I will make further enquiries and find out who posted him there,” he said. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
