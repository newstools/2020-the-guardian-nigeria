Nigerians have been urged to preserve the environment and save lives by planting trees around their domains. The charge was given by the president of the Rotary Club of Agege, Lukman Akande, at the weekend when he led members of the club to Cardinal Odunbanku and Powerline Primary Healthcare Centres (PHCs) in Agege area of Lagos State.
 
According to him, trees help clean the air people breathe, filter the water and provide habitat to over 80 per cent of the world’s terrestrial biodiversity, just as forests provide jobs to over 1.6 billion people, absorb harmful carbons from the atmosphere and are key ingredients in 25 per cent of all medicines.
 
He added that plants help reduce stress and create a feeling of wellbeing, as an average-size tree produces enough oxygen in one year to keep a family of four breathing.
 
“Tree planting is an annual event worldwide and as Rotarians, it is part of our six areas of focus to preserve and conserve the earth, that is providing shelter to humanity. This is the message we are putting out in our community: to make everyone aware that it is not just about fashion or aesthetics, but actually for our own good to encourage tree planting in our abode and make the world a habitable place for us all.”
 
The Assistant Director of Nursing at Powerline PHC, Mrs O. Oyebola, commended the club for the gesture and promised to nurture the trees as a legacy of the relationship between man and his environment. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
