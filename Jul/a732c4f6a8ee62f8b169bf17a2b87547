Hours after a Presidency source told The Guardian that the acting chairman of the Economic and Financial Crime Commission Ibrahim Magu has been suspended, another official has said the investigation of the EFCC boss is a testament to President Muhammadu Buhari’s anti-corruption stance. Magu has been answering questions from a panel investigating sundry allegations against him since Monday. “Under the Muhammadu Buhari administration, nobody is above scrutiny,” a top official in the Presidency said on Tuesday. The official said the interrogation of the anti-graft agency boss is to give him the opportunity to clear himself of the weighty allegations against him. The source maintained that the investigation of the EFCC boss was to reinforce the Buhari administration’s commitment to transparency and accountability. The source assured that the administration will not prejudge anyone as it could be counted on to uphold justice and fairness. “In consonance with the principle of fairness and justice, it was needful that the acting chairman be given the opportunity to respond to the allegations, which are weighty in nature,” the source said. “The investigation is to reinforce transparency and accountability, rather than to vitiate it. “Accountability for our actions or inactions is an inalienable part of democracy. “In such an elevated position as that of EFCC Chairman, the holder of the position must be above suspicion. “There’s no prejudgment. Absolutely none. The Buhari administration can be counted on to uphold fairness
and justice at all times.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
