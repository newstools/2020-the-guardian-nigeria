Abia State Police Command said yesterday that its Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) has arrested four suspects who plotted and kidnapped one Chekwas Daniel in his shop at Aba by luring him out during a church service to sell to a large number of goods. The suspects’ names were given as Bright Chinonso, Eze Ernest, Chisom Godwin and Chinoyerem Chineye. The State Police Commissioner, Mrs. Janet Agbede who confirmed the arrest, said investigations on the incident were being concluded towards charging them to court. According to her, the suspects saw the telephone number of the victim written on his shop door and called him while he was attending a church service. “They told him they wanted to buy a large quantity of his clothing which huge volume motivated the victim to rush out before church service ended to attend to them. “When he got to his shop and did not see them, he called them back and they came. But as he opened the shop, they grabbed him and put him in a vehicle. “But as he was being moved into their vehicle, our SARS men led by Johnbull Obioguru got a tip-off and they chased and arrested the kidnappers at Ngwa road by Mosque street and rescued the victim,” she said.
