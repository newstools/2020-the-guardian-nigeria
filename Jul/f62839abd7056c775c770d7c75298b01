President of African Export-Import Bank (Afrexim), Prof. Benedict Oramah, has been challenged to reposition the bank for post-COVID-19 economy. Political economist, Dr. Obiora Okonkwo, who gave the charge, said the COVID-19 global pandemic has deepened the need for a continental integrated market to improve intra-African trade, stressing that the coronavirus pandemic has triggered some shocks in the continent’s economy.
 
While congratulating Prof. Oramah on his re-appointment as the President of the Cairo-based Pan-African multilateral financial institution, Okonkwo recalled how within a short time on the saddle, the bank recorded giant strides in Africa’s business.
 
On the likely solutions to post-COVID-19 pandemic shocks to the continent’s economy, he said: “An integrated market will be a major boost to intra-African trade, because Africa is a very large market. A boost to intra-Africa trade will go a long way to recreate many business models across the continent.”  “The re-election is a testament to the trust and confidence of shareholders of the bank in his leadership. Oramah had in the first term led the bank creditably. During this time, he disbursed about $30billion to boost businesses on the continent. I am therefore not surprised that the shareholders re-elected him.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
