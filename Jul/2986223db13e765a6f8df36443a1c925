The Federal University Oye-Ekiti (FUOYE) said it would admit students into the Faculty of Pharmacy in the coming 2020/2021 academic year.Vice-Chancellor, FUOYE, Prof. Kayode Soremekun, who disclosed this while briefing newsmen, said that the decision followed the final approval of the pharmacy degree programme granted to the university by the National Universities Commission (NUC). The Vice Chancellor said that FUOYE had put everything needed ready for the faculty to commence during the on-going 2019/2020 session, but added that the delay was due to the fact that when the NUC approval came, it was too late for Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) to allocate students to FUOYE. “However, we informed JAMB of the NUC approval and the board has now officially enlisted FUOYE as one of Nigerian universities that offer Pharmacy starting from 2020/2021 session. Candidates who sat for JAMB exams in March 2020 now have opportunity to apply to the Faculty of Pharmacy in FUOYE. “We have a new Faculty of Pharmacy building in place. The laboratories and offices are well-equipped with modern equipment that are necessary for effective running of the programme. The university has many members of staff and has appointed over 20 competent academic members of staff in different cadres for the programme,” the VC said.
