Apparently bowing to the fresh threat by the chapter’s Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) to ruffle feathers should the pro-chancellor, Dr. Wale Babalakin come anywhere near the institution, the University of Lagos (UNILAG) yesterday postponed its governing council meeting originally scheduled for today to Friday. There has been no lost between the lecturers and Babalakin since the postponement of the ivory tower’s convocation over the former’s role in the entire exercise. Following the development, the union had declared the governing council chair persona non grata. A statement by the Registrar and Secretary to Council, Oladejo Azeez, said the pro-chancellor had sanctioned the shift. The letter read in part: “I have been directed by the pro-chancellor and chairman of the governing council, Dr. Bolanle Babalakin (SAN), to inform council members that the special meeting scheduled for Wednesday, July 15 to Friday, July 17, 2020, has been postponed. “Certain issues have arisen that require consideration that will make it impossible to hold the meeting. For this reason, the meeting will be postponed to a more suitable time. Council members will be given appropriate notice in accordance with the standing rules about council meetings.” It was, however, learnt that the vice chancellor, Prof. Oluwatoyin Ogundipe, had on Monday, written the pro-chancellor on the danger of physical meeting at this time, suggesting a virtual one instead.
