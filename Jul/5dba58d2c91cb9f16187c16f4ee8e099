• Insists On NDDC Reformation
Member representing Khana/Gokana Federal Constituency in the National Assembly, Dumnamene Robinson Dekor, has described the attempt to arrest the former Managing Director of Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), Ms. Joi Nunieh, as unlawful.
   
Dekor urged security operatives in the country to always follow due process, while performing their duties and avoid methodologies that could leave loopholes for miscreants to take undue advantage.
   
While frowning at the current harassment of the former NDDC boss, the Rivers State-born federal lawmaker commended Governor Nyesom Wike for his prompt intervention, stressing that only God knew what would have befallen the embattled woman.
   
He pleaded with the law enforcement not to jeopardise the existing peace in the state, saying “but for Wike’s timely and necessary intervention, the ugly episode might have incited a more serious situation in the state than the security operatives could have envisaged.”  Stressing that Nunieh is his constituent, Dekor called on President Buhari to, as a matter of urgent public importance, intervene to unravel the mystery of the unfolding drama in the NDDC and concomitant issues that tend to threaten the little that is left of the nation’s integrity.
   
The lawmaker regretted that Nigerian’s’ rights were regularly trampled upon as in an animal kingdom, just as he described the many years of the establishment of the commission as wasted, with nothing to show for all the monies earmarked for developing the Niger Delta.
      
He enjoined the Federal Government to find true Nigerians, true Niger Deltans, with the competences and integrity, “so we can have an NDDC that will run and build the place for all.  If not, what we see now, we are just like wasting our time.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
