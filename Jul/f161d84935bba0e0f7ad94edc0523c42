Ogun to begin enforcement of face masks August 4
Ogun State Governor Dapo Abiodun has signed the revised 2020 Appropriation Bill into law, with a pledge to pay attention to health, education, infrastructure and other sectors. Abiodun, while signing the budget, which was reduced from N449.97 billion to N280 billion, in his office at Oke-Mosan, Abeokuta, noted that the review was due to the adverse effect of the COVID-19 pandemic and in line with the current realities. In another development, the governor solicited the support of the National Assembly to enable Ogun and Lagos states reconstruct the Abeokuta-Ifo-Lagos and the Sagamu-Ikorodu roads. He made the appeal in his office when he received the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, who paid him a courtesy call. He said the takeover of  would enable the two states put them in proper shape, thus taking the load off the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway and bring succour to users. Gbajabiamila, who spoke earlier, listed road infrastructure as one of the areas where the House would collaborate with the state government. However, the governor has warned that defaulters of mandatory use of face masks in public places, which takes effect from August 4, 2020, risk six months jail term, adding that schools will resume on August 4 for final year students in Senior Secondary School (SSS3), while private and public schools and religious centres would be reopened tentatively on August 14, 2020.
