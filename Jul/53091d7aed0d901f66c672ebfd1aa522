Members of Rotary Club of Eko Atlantic and representatives of Lagos State Waste Management Authority (LAWMA) The Rotary Club of Eko Atlantic, in partnership with the Lagos State Waste Management Authority (LAWMA), has held sensitisation on waste separation as part of efforts to ensure a clean environment and waste-free drains. The RCEA Bin Recycler Project, led by Rtn. Pallavi Kaurani and supported by Rtn. Shweta Srivastava, saw residents of LSDPC flats at Adeola Odeku, in Victoria Island, being educated on the need for waste segregation. President of RCEA, Rtn. Sunit Deb Roy, said effective segregation of waste would result in less waste going to the landfills, which would make it cheaper for the people and better for the environment. The Managing Director of LAWMA, Ibrahim Odumboni, appreciated the work done by the Rotary Club for helping to spread the awareness of waste segregation. Meanwhile, the club has also pledged to end mortality from sickle cell, cancer, typhoid, infant and maternal diseases in Lagos State with its donation of laboratory equipment to assist accurate testing, diagnosis and treatment at Ogba primary healthcare centre. The club also donated electrophoresis machine, medical centrifuge machine, laboratory/research binocular microscopes, heamoglobin metre and laboratory incubator to upgrade testing and diagnosis capacity to reduce death rate, according to the president, Dr. Sunit Deb Roy. In reaction, the Chief Medical Laboratory Scientist, Dr Akinkunmi Tolu, said the medical equipment are vital to boosting diagnosis in pregnant women and children, who contract respiratory tract infection and other diseases, adding that proper tests and treatment would be administered rather than trying different types of medication that puts lives at risk.
