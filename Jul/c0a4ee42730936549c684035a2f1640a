• U.S., UK, China, Germany dump wastes on Africa
• Toxins found in breast milk, vegetables, others
• Experts lament weak legislation to tackle the menace Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Nigeria and the rest of Africa may soon begin to grapple with a different layer of complicated health issues unless governments rise up to the mounting electronic waste (e-waste) on the continent. Latest findings indicate that, while Nigerians generate e-Waste owing to various unused electronic materials, developed countries, including Germany, China, United Kingdom, Belgium and the United States of America still ship huge tones of e-Waste into Africa. The Guardian gathered that Nigeria generated 461.3-kilo tonnes (KT) in 2019 to rank the highest in West Africa and second after Egypt on the continent. The 461.3kt amounts to $166, 060, 000 (N64.2 billion).
        
Specifically, the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), a United Nation’s arm in charge of global telecommunications, noted that approximately 60,000 to71,000 t of used electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) were imported yearly into Nigeria through the two main ports in Lagos since 2015.
    
While this importation lasted in Nigeria, ITU noted that specific e-Waste legislation on the management of it is still lacking in most African countries. According to it, few countries have legislation published in Africa, these include Egypt, Ghana, Madagascar, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Cameroon, and Côte d’Ivoire. However, it said enforcing the legislation is very challenging.  Ahove, who said the worth of e-Waste generated in Nigeria runs into billions, informed that “when people come to a street, especially those Hausa boys, they collect some scraps and sell them to some companies. “There is recycling in Nigeria, but locally. But what we have not done is to develop a systemic arrangement of monitoring those who are involved in it, which is very important. These are good sources of economic upliftment for the people if well harnessed. These people need to be educated, trained and supported for them to do their jobs well. It will bring less danger to the public.’’
   
Already, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said children were especially vulnerable to the health risks posed by e-Waste exposure and, therefore, need more specific protection.  Quantifying the value of the 461.3Kt generated in Nigeria, the ATCON President, said according to UN figures, “it would suggest that the price of e-Waste per kilo is greater than the price of the equivalent in Gold.”
    
Teniola on weak e-Waste legislation in Nigeria noted that there appears to be an e-Waste market in Africa and the trade involves countries in the West, where most of the second-hand computers, phones and electronic devices are shipped in for sale in various computer markets along the coast of West Africa, with Nigeria hosting the largest market that trades in the purchasing and selling of this electronic and electrical equipment.
   
The ATCON President, who took on the Standard Organisation of Nigeria (SON), said: “the issue isn’t with the secondary market but that the SON can curtail the presence of substandard electrical and electronic equipment in the market. The real challenge appears to be what happens to the equipment when they reach the end of life. Simply having legislation without enforcement will create the environmental problem that the e-Waste creates when left to be handled by the informal sector.”
   
President, Phone and Allied Product Dealers Association of Nigeria (PAPDAN), Ifeanyi Akubue, said e-Waste was still a major issue in Lagos, “but there are people who buy scraps from Computer Village, and later resell them to some companies for recycling.’’  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
