The aged-long overlapping of functions in the maritime sector will soon be a thing of the past, as the parastatals under the Federal Ministry of Transportation have agreed on the modalities for resolving the issues.
   
The Director-General, Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA), Dr. Bashir Jamoh, disclosed this in Lagos, after a meeting with heads of the parastatals at the Nigerian Shippers Council (NSC) headquarters.
   
Jamoh said the agreement followed the work of a ministerial committee, stressing that meetings like this are necessary to build synergies, and create the right atmosphere for the overall progress of the economy.  Those who attended the meeting were the Executive Secretary of NSC, Hassan Bello; Jamoh; and Managing Director, Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), Hadiza Bala Usman; Managing Director, National Inland Waterways Authority, Dr. George Moghalu; while the Rector, Maritime Academy of Nigeria (MAN), Oron, Commodore Duja Effedua (Rtd), joined via Zoom.
