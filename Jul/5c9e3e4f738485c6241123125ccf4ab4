Governor Abdullah Umar Ganduje Saturday read the riot act to commercial transport operators and commuters to either adhere strictly with the use of face mask or risk prosecution. Ganduje, who issued the warning while flagging off another round face masks distribution at the Government House, directed security agencies to ensure offenders are brought to book. Although Ganduje disclosed that the state taskforce team was recording success in the fight to mitigate the spread of the virus in Kano, he insisted the government would continue strict enforcement on COVID-19 preventive protocols and guidelines. While reiterating government decision to cancel Eid Kabir Sallah festival in Kano to curtail possible spread, he insisted that wearing of face mask and maintenance of social distancing remain compulsory during the two “raka” congregational Sallah prayers. Meanwhile, Kano State Commissioner of Police, CP Habu Sani said police will arrest any driver and passenger who failed to comply with the use of face mask and other COVID-19 protocols at all transport terminals in the state. He insisted that “any person found disregarding the protocol will be treated as deviant”. The CP stressed that a combine security team has mounted checkpoints at 17 inter-state entry points and 156 intra-states border points to ensure effective use of face mask. “Government has considered the transport unions in all the decisions on COVID-19 preventive measures including the use of face mask,” Sani said. “Now, it is compulsory to use face mask. With the policy on the compulsory use of face mask, the police will deploy full enforcement especially at our motor parks. Any driver or passenger that fail to use face mask will be treated as deviant.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
