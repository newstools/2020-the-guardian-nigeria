Plateau state government says it will not hesitate to totally lockdown the state if citizens do not change their attitude and adhere to laid-down COVID-19 guidelines. According to the government, COVID-19 cases are rising daily while residents refuse to use facemasks outside. Besides, the government was equally irked by the wanton disregard of the national curfew, from 10.00pm to 4.00am. A statement yesterday by the Commissioner for Information, Dan Manjang, warned that failure to observe the guidelines would end in regret for anyone caught. Manjang added wearing of facemasks is mandatory and should be strictly enforced by security agents. He also warned those that go jogging with total disregard to social distancing, saying they would be dealt with. Speaker, State House of Assembly, Abok Nuhu Ayuba, has indicated his willingness to work with any group which aim is to complement governmentâ€™s efforts in the fight against the pandemic in the state. Ayuba stated this when officials of the Civil Society Emergency Intervention Group on COVID-19 visited him at the assembly complex in Jos. State coordinator of the group, Ahmed Adaru, said the group was a coalition of different civil society organisations across the country with the sole aim of creating awareness on the pandemic.
