These signs are either telling you something about your heart or about your health which you need to take seriously. Below are some signs your hands are telling you about your health according to The Health: Enlarged fingertips
Abnormal growth at your fingertips should put you on alert. It’s called “nail clubbing.” “This is an increase in the tissue around the ends of the fingers where the nail curves and the cause of this is low oxygen in the blood, something that may indicate lung disease. Nail Biting
It may be more than just a bad habit. If your nails are bitten down to the stubs to the point of bleeding, you may need to seek professional help. Biting your nails may feel uncontrollable and it may be one symptom on the spectrum of obsessive-compulsive disorders. Treatments can range from applying a bitter-tasting compound onto nails to break the urge to psychiatric medications. Colour Change
If nails look like they’re lifting up from the nail bed and are turning a colour you know they should not, such as, white, green, or yellow, talk to your doctor. Called onycholysis, it may be due to a recent bacterial or fungal nail infection, or it could signal an underlying health issue such as thyroid disease. Long Index Finger
Your index and ring finger can tell you a lot about your health destiny; it is something that’s determined based on exposure to sex hormones testosterone and estrogen in utero. Those exposures can predispose—or protect—you from a host of diseases, including prostate cancer risk. According to some research, men who have an index finger longer than their ring finger have a 33 percent lower risk of prostate cancer. Purple Rash Along Wrist
Purplish, itchy bumps around the wrist may be an inflammatory condition known as lichen planus. Though it may look like a contagious rash, it’s not. Most common in middle-aged adults, the condition can be triggered by the flu vaccine, prescription medications, like those used for high blood pressure or arthritis, or over-the-counter painkillers.
