As Nigeria battles economic crisis caused by COVID-19, Managing director of CMOLondon, Elizabeth Patricia Traore -Andony, has called on the Federal government and other relevant agencies to deepen trade relations with African countries to forestall any form of hindrance in this period of economy uncertainty ravaging the world. Speaking in Lagos, Andony stated that CMOLondon has the viable structure to promote investment opportunities between Nigeria and Central Africa counties.
She also noted that Nigeria, recognized as one of the big nations in Africa, needs to build a solid trade relationship with countries in the continent to boost the economic standard of the nation. “Adding signature to the Africa Continental free trade area agreement, Nigeria showed its willingness to boost intra regional trade. Nigeria needs much work to improve on this. According to United Nations data, only 16% of African trade is from crisis and into a new age of collaboration. With decades of cross border experience, we’re ready to partner with relevant government and private agencies to achieve this trade goal. We believe in African collaboration.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
