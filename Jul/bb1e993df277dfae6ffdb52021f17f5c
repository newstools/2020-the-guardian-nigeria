Former International, Ifeanyi Udeze, believes Super Eagles’ assistant coach, Joseph Yobo, is the best trainer for the team’s defenders, saying he has a lot to teach the players to make them more effective. Udeze told The Guardian yesterday that Yobo’s wealth of experience from playing for the Super Eagles for a long period can guide the players to become more tactically disciplined, adding that the former Everton defender should be assigned important roles in the team. Udeze, who commended the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) for giving the Super Eagles’ captain the opportunity to work with the national team coaches, said the appointment has shown former internationals that the country would always remember even when they have stopped playing. “In this modern era of coaching, apart from the head coach, who coordinates all the departments, assistant coaches are assigned to manage some departments of the team. That’s why I think Yobo should be deployed to the Eagles’ defence and the defensive midfield. “He has played at the highest level of football and acquired enough experience, So, handling these areas will not be a problem for him. “We should understand that club football is different from national team games. Yobo should be in a better position to talk to the players on the best approach and positioning in the national team.” Udeze urged critics, who believe that Yobo would not function well because he has not acquired the right certificates, to give the three-time World Cup star the benefit of doubt, saying that so many international coaches started handling their national teams even before the acquired their coaching certificates.
