As world airlines gradually return to operations after the coronavirus-induced lockdown, demand in air cargo is also beginning to improve despite subsisting capacity crunch.
 
The International Air Transport Association (IATA) data for global air freight markets released yesterday, showed that capacity remains unable to meet demand as a result of the loss of belly cargo operations on passenger aircraft that have been parked.
 
Global demand, measured in cargo tonne-kilometres (CTKs), fell by 20.3 per cent in May (-21.5 per cent for international operations) compared to the previous year. That is an improvement from the 25.6 per cent year-on-year drop recorded in April.
 
Global capacity, measured in available cargo tonne-kilometres (ACTKs), shrank by 34.7 per cent in May (-32.2 per cent for international operations) compared to the previous year, a slight deceleration from the 41.6 per cent year-on-year drop in April.  Asia-Pacific airlines saw demand for international air cargo fall by 21.3 per cent in May 2020 compared to the same period a year earlier. This was a solid improvement over the 25.2 per cent drop in April. Seasonally adjusted freight volumes also rebounded slightly in May and have now reached 75 per cent of their pre-COVID-19 crisis levels. Shipments of personal protective equipment (PPE) are helping support airlines in the region. International capacity decreased 31 per cent.
