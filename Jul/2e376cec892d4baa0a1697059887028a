The Obingwa General Assembly (OGA), a Lagos-based umbrella body for the indigenes of Obingwa Local Government Area of Abia State, has doled out cash and food materials to those in need as a result of the coronavirus pandemic lockdown. The beneficiaries, made up of 100 men and women from the local council resident in Lagos, went home with items worth about N20,000 each. On why the association embarked on the exercise, president of OGA, Elder Gideon Ubani-Ebere, said he noticed that the lockdown had impacted negatively on the sources of livelihood of his people, some of whom have lost their jobs. Moved by the excruciating hardship on the people, Ubani-Ebere said the committee met via zoom and agreed to contribute and extend love to the needy as the body’s own little contribution towards alleviating the suffering of their members. Chairman of the palliative committee, Godswill Nwachukwu, expressed delight over the act of charity, saying it had always been his wish to help the weak and the needy. “I feel so fulfilled when people’s tears are wiped through this type of initiative. I call on well-meaning citizens to use every opportunity that presents itself to help those who are in need,” he said. Elder statesman and former Chief Executive Officer of Thomas Cook, Chief Godson Evulukwu, and former labour leader, Comrade Uzoije Ukaumunna, who are both founding members of OGA, said they were pleased to witness the successful distribution of the palliatives to 100 beneficiaries in Lagos.
