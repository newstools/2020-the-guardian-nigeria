Four dead as vehicle plunges into Ogun River
A truck belonging to a popular cement company was yesterday set ablaze in Lokoja, Kogi State capital, after the truck crushed a middle-aged man and his son to death.
 
According to an eyewitness, the empty truck was about negotiating the bend leading to Zone 8 Roundabout when it lost control and crushed a pedestrian who was standing by the roadside with his two sons.
 
While the man was crushed alongside one of his sons, luck, however, smiled on the other one who escaped unhurt. It was gathered that onlookers, in reaction, attacked the truck and set it ablaze after the driver fled the scene.  Meanwhile, four persons have been confirmed dead after a vehicle plunged into Ososa River, along Ijebu-Ode Road, Ogun State, yesterday, at about 10:20a.m. on the second Ososa Bridge, inbound Ijebu-Ode.
 
The lone accident involved a commercial Opel car with registration number, GGE 596 DV. The Ogun State Traffic Compliance and Enforcement Corps Public Relations Officer, Babatunde Akinbiyi, blamed the incident on over-speeding.
 
The accident claimed the lives of three men and one woman out of the six passengers in the vehicle. All the four bodies have been deposited at Ijebu-Ode General Hospital Morgue.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
