In a now-deleted series of tweets, Kanye West accused Kardashian of trying to lock him up and said that he was trying to divorce her. “I would like to apologize to my wife Kim for going public with something that was a private matter. I did not cover her like she has covered me. To Kim I want to say I know I hurt you. Please forgive me. Thank you for always being there for me,” the rapper tweeted on Saturday. West’s apology comes three days after Kardashian had described his twitter outburst as ‘a bi-polar episode’. On Tuesday morning, West set off a series of accusatory tweets, which he alleged that Kim and his mother-in-law, who he referred to as as “Kris Jong-Un”, were trying to force him into psychiatric treatment. “They tried to fly in with 2 doctors to 51/50 me,” West said, a reference to the California welfare code that says people who may be a danger to themselves can be placed in an involuntary hold. “Kriss and Kim put out a statement without my approval … that’s not what a wife should do White supremacy,” West added. West also tweeted he was trying to divorce Kim ever since she allegedly met his fellow rapper Meek Mill at the Waldorf Hotel. In November 2018, Kardashian and Meek Mill attended a criminal justice summit. “I been trying to get divorced since Kim met with Meek at the Warldolf [sic] for ‘prison reform”, Kanye said, adding about Kris: ‘This my lady tweet of the night… Kris Jong-Un.” Kim Kardashian later addressed the outburst on her Instagram story on Wednesday, she called for compassion and asked that the public respect the family’s privacy as Kanye West deals with bipolar disorder.
