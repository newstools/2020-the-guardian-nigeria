 Jubril Akande (left) and Segun Ibironke have been training at the Ibadan Golf Club ahead of 2020 AWA Ibraheem Golf Championship.  With the outbreak of the coronavirus forcing the suspension of most sporting activities the world over, Jubril and Ibironke have been praying for the tournament to hold this year for them to realise their dreams of acquiring improved points to break into world ranking. Speaking after a training session at the IGC, Akande said the AWA Ibraheem Championship is key on the calendar of the Nigeria Golf Federation (NGF), adding that it would help him to assess his standard, as well as aid his entry into the ranking cadre of the Junior World Amateur Golf. “Segun and I have increased our training schedule here and have been playing under the guidance of professional golfers to gain more experience and improve our games. We hope this year’s AWA Ibraheem tournament will hold for us to gain more points that will qualify us into world ranking category. Ibironke, who is the current IGC captain’s son, was runner-up twice at the U-13 andU-14 categories of AWA Ibraheem tournament in the past. Now he is looking to an improved place if only Ikeja Golf Club could be allowed to host the teenage golf tourney this year. “It has always been an awesome experience for us playing along other kid golfers from the Golf Section of Ikoyi Club 1938 in Lagos; IBB International Golf and Country Club, Abuja; Rosani Golf Club, Ekiti; Lamingo and Rayfield Golf Clubs in Jos; Otukpo Golf Club; Ibom Golf Club; Abeokuta Golf Club; Ibori Golf and Country Club, Asaba; Port Harcourt Golf Club; among others. I can’t wait to witness another edition again this year, I pray the COVID-19 pandemic will allow us,” Ibironke noted.
