 Businessman Shankar Kurade from western India’s Pune city has ditched his medical face mask for an attention-drawing solid gold mask. The 49-year-old is said to have spent an equivalent of £4,000 for the face covering which weighs 60 grams and took eight days to create. Kurade’s love for gold is not new as he is known to never leave his house without an enormous bracelet, thick gold chains on his neck and large rings on most of his fingers. He knew he wanted to stand out when the need for a face mask became necessary due to the novel coronavirus pandemic.  Then he saw a news report about a man who had commissioned a silver face mask and realised that he could do the same, only he would get a mask out of his favourite precious metal. Speaking about his unusual face mask, Kurhade said: “I love gold and I am very happy with wearing this mask. It is a thin mask and has tiny holes so I am not facing any problems with breathing.” Shankar Kurade | Oddity He added: “I always go out wearing all the jewellery pieces so when I saw this man on TV wearing a mask made of gold, I thought ‘why should I not get it made in gold?’ “I went to my personal jeweller and proposed the idea.

They are startled to see me waking with a gold mask. They are curious to know if it is real gold.”
