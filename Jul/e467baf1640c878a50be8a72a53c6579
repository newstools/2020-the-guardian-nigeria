The Nigeria Basketball Federation (NBBF) believes the recent listing of D’Tigers’ Captain, Ike Diogu, Al Faroug and other Nigerians in the top 10 list of FIBA/Africa player of the decade will boost the confidence of the team ahead of next year’s Olympics in Tokyo, Japan. NBBF Vice President, Babs Ogunade said the recognition will also spur young players at the grassroots to continue working hard to be the best in the sport. “The listing of Ike Diogu and other Nigerian national team players in the top list of the FIBA Africa Player of the Decade is a positive step, which recognises that Nigerian players are to be reckoned with in the continent when it comes to Basketball. “The NBBF belief it would put the entire team in the right spirit ahead of next year’s Olympics in Tokyo. Now, basketball activities in the country are still on hold due to the lockdown on sports because of the COVID-19 pandemic. “The NBBF will start preparing D’Tigers and D’Tigress for the Olympics when sports activities resume. The board will also put things in shape for the league season pending when sports activities resume,” he said. According to reports, the FIBA/Africa Basketball Player of the Decade list was compiled based on the impact of the Nigerian players in their various clubs and FIBA organised championships.
