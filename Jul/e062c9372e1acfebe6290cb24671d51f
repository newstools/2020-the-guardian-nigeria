The Metropolitan Correctional Center, Chicago The Metropolitan Correctional Center, Chicago is a United States federal prison in Chicago, Illinois. The facility holds male and female prisoners of all security levels prior to and during court proceedings in the Northern District of Illinois, as well as inmates serving brief sentences. Since his extradition to the United States of America last week, Ramon Olorunwa Abass alias Hushpuppi has been putting up in this facility pending when he is moved to another facility in Los Angeles where he will be tried. The 37-year-old known popularly on social media as Ray Hushpuppi is alleged to have conspired to launder hundreds of millions of dollars through business email compromise (BEC) frauds and other scams, the US Department of Justice (DoJ) said. The Metropolitan Correctional Center, Chicago The facility holds 567 inmates in total and is located in Northern Illinois in the Cook County of Chicago. Architect, Harry Weese designed the Chicago Metropolitan Correctional Center which was completed in 1975. The building has a triangle shape. The reason for that according to the designer is, “The triangular plan provides the most perimeter for the space. We needed perimeter so each room could have an outside window.” It was also conceived to cut out the need for long wasteful corridors. The rooms are placed on the outer edges of the building to leave the inner core of each unit free to be used as a lounge and dining area. Each unit of the prison is bi-level, with an open two-story lounge area in the middle. The stairs and elevators are located in the building’s three corners.
