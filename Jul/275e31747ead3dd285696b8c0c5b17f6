The Federal Government has appealed to the World Bank to assist it in reducing the population of out-of- school children from 10 to five million by 2023. The Minister of Education, Mallam Adamu Adamu, made the call when a World Bank delegation, led by its Country Director, Mr. Shubham Chawdry, paid him a working visit in Abuja. The minister said the plea was consistent with the current administration’s efforts at ensuring that Nigerian children had access to qualitative education, irrespective of their economic backgrounds. He said his ministry was working with the global lender on projects in that respect, especially in the area of increased girl-child enrolment. Commending the bank on its commitment to the development of the nation’s educational sector, Adamu expressed government’s readiness for better interventions that would tackle obstacles to the eradication of the phenomenon. In his remarks, Chawdry reiterated his organisation’s commitment to the improvement of the sector.Stressing that education was a sure way of eliminating poverty, the World Bank official pledged the readiness of the financial institution to assist in financing more programmes that would foster the development of the country’s educational system. He also declared the bank’s interest in long-term projects, adding that the lender would no longer dictate developmental schemes but leave the decision to governments, as they were in the best position to know the needs of their citizens.
