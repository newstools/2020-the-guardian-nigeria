The Benue State Livestock Guards, yesterday, impounded 92 cows for contravening the Open Grazing Prohibition and Ranches Establishment Law 2017 of the state. State Commander of the Livestock Guards, Mr. Linus Zaki who paraded the impounded animals in Makurdi, told newsmen that 60 cows were impounded in Ohimini and 30 in Logo Local Council Areas of the state. He stated that owners of the affected livestock must pay the stipulated fines to get back their cattle. Zaki emphasised the determination of the Guards to enforcement, saying animals kept in ranches were also enjoying the protection according to provisions of the law. Special Adviser to the Governor on Security Matters, Paul Hembah expressed the commitment of Governor Samuel Ortom to the rule of law and the safety of Benue people. He lamented a situation where cattle owners abandon hired herders arrested by the Livestock Guards to their fate and hire new herders to look after their animals, stressing the need for the amendment of the law to also provide punishment for erring livestock owners. In a reaction, Secretary of the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria in Benue State, Malam Ibrahim Galma promised to step up sensitisation of herdsmen on importance of the grazing law, which he noted was more beneficial to them.
