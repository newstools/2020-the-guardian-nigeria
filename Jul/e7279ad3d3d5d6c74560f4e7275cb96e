The Lagos State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has suffered another tragedy following the death of a member of the Lagos House of Assembly, Tunde Buraimoh, who represented Kosofe State Constituency II until his death yesterday. Buraimoh, who passed on in the early hours of at the infectious Disease Hospital, Yaba, where he had spent some days, according to sources at the Assembly, was buried at the Ikoyi Cemetery according to Muslim rites. Until his death, he was chairman of the House Committee on Information, Strategy and Security. Buraimoh’s death came exactly 26 days after the party lost Senator Bayo Oshinowo, who represented Lagos East Senatorial District to COVID-19 complications on June 15. Both lawmakers were from Kosofe Constituency and said to be very close. State Publicity Secretary of APC, Seye Oladejo, said Buraimoh’s death was a big blow to the party, especially coming less than a month after that of Oshinowo. Lawmakers in the state, perhaps worried over the state of Buraimoh’s health, were in sombre mood during their plenary on Thursday, where they called for more proactive measures to contain the spread of the pandemic.
 
They urged Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu to take proactive measures by directing the Commissioner for Health to collaborate with the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) and also accredit more private medical personnel and facilities to join in efforts to fight the pandemic.
 
Buraimoh was a former chairman of Kosofe Local Government and the Bamofin of Ketuland. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
