President Muhammadu Buhari has sent greetings and commendation to a Nigerian doctorate student in University of Tsukuba, Japan, Mr Ikenna Nweke, who returned a missing wallet with huge sums of money to the police and also turned down offer of a percentage from the authorities. President Buhari saluted Nweke for projecting the values of honesty, integrity and contentment, noting that good virtues and propriety are the hallmark of every culture in Nigeria, while crimes and criminalities are exceptions. Buhari said Nwekeâ€™s behaviour, coming at a period that the country needs a positive spotlight and close-up on its real values, clearly signposts what should hold the nation together, inspired by solid foundations laid by most families, religious bodies and communities for success in life. President Buhari in a statement signed by Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, on Saturday wished Nweke all the best in his studies and work as a teaching assistant in the same university. He further urged all Nigerians, home and abroad, to keep celebrating the age-old, irreplaceable attributes of honesty and decorum, and shun the microwaved, get-rich-quick tendencies that bring individual and collective shame.
