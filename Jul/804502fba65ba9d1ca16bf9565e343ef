A lot of us struggle with our hair and you must have tried different local and foreign concoctions to grow your broken tresses, damaged edges and restore luster to your once shining mane. Fret no more as we have searched high and low for the following sure-fire things you can do to improve the health of your hair and keep it from shedding prematurely or breaking off. Not including the obvious elimination of chemical treatments, this comprehensive list contains all you need to maintain healthy hair. They are categorised by care/maintenance and styling. Care and Maintenance 
Get rid of shampoos with sulfates; it doesn’t matter if you hair is natural or relaxed. Sulfates strip the hair of needed moisture and natural oils.
Pre-shampoo your hair with coconut oil or olive oil; they help hair retain its moisture and protein. Both natural oils protect the hair from being stripped and from excessive swelling of the cuticle when you shampoo. Deep condition your hair with a moisturising conditioner after every wash. Get protein treatment; you can do this once a month or more if your hair is breaking. Trim away split ends as necessary, but don’t get a trim for the sake of trimming. If your goal is to retain length, you’ll only be cutting off perfectly good hair. The less you do to damage your hair, the less you’ll need to trim it. No microfiber or towel drying. Contrary to popular belief, microfiber rips the hair out. It acts like velcro to our tresses. Towel drying frizzes the hair. Air-dry or use an old t-shirt. Refrigerate your leave-in conditioner. A cold leave-in will help to seal your hair’s cuticle after washing. This is extremely helpful if you can’t take a cold water rinse. It will also increase the shine in your hair. Lubricate your hair with light natural oil daily. Jojoba is light and helps keep the hair tangle-free. Seal your ends with Jamaican Black Castor Oil; it’s best at protecting your ends from splitting. Seal after every wash and before styling. Massage your scalp to stimulate your hair follicles. Some believe this encourages hair growth, but it certainly does increase the blood flow to your scalp.Take a multi-vitamin with Methylosulfonylmethame (MSM). MSM is believed to extend the lifespan of your individual hairs, while also alleviating dry scalp. Never sleep without covering your hair. It’s more prone to tangling and breakage. Tie it up and use a satin scarf, bonnet and use a satin pillowcase; this locks in your hair’s moisture. Moisturise your hair. If it feels dry, moisturize. If you are chemically relaxed, you may need to do so 1-2 times daily. Natural hair may only require moisturizing every couple days. Don’t use too many different brands. When your hair begins responding, you want to know what’s working. Reduce excess product use and keep it simple.
Eat a diet rich in Omega-3 fatty acids; it’s good for your hair and skin too, keeping both soft and pliable. Clarify monthly. Hair products build up on the hair and every now and then the hair needs to be thoroughly cleansed. Especially, if you only condition wash, you can either use a clarifying shampoo once a month or add a tablespoon of baking soda to your hair while shampooing; apple cider vinegar is another option. Styling 
Wear simple styles that offer little manipulation of your tresses and hide your ends, which are the oldest parts of your hair. As it’s raining, low maintenance protective hairstyles you can do include braids, twists, weaves, crotchet, wigs and hair extensions. Stop heat styling your hair; air-drying is the best thing you can do to keep your hair on your head. Limit heat styling to rare special occasions.
Never comb/brush dry hair to style. Finger comb or wear hair in twist outs, twists, braids or braids out to minimise breakage. Comb hair from the bottom up. When your hair is soaking wet and saturated with conditioner, you can comb it with a large toothcomb to detangle. Do so carefully, working from the bottom up. If your hair is tangled, gently pull it up and apart instead of pulling it apart like bread. Use hair accessories with no hanging parts or exposed metal. Banana clips, satin scrunchies, flex barrettes, bobby pins and elastic bands are the best for styling hair so that it does not get damaged. Avoid pulling hair tight at the hairline; doing so will recede your hairline and damage the follicles permanently. Also, hanging nails will damage hair. Ensure your nails are smooth and even before hair styling. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
