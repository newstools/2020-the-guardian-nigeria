The Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Mohammed Adamu, has decorated the 10 newly promoted senior officers at the force headquarters in Abuja. The event followed the recent elevation of 6,601 personnel, including one DIG, four AIGs, three CPs, three DCPs, eight CSPs, 607 SPs, 206 DSPs, and 5,769 ASPs. At the ceremony yesterday, the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha, assured of Federal Government’s commitment to the ongoing reforms by the IGP. The police chief said since his assumption of office in January last year, 41,863 had been elevated across board. He stated that the promotions – a strategic management approach geared at motivating the workforce in addressing current and emerging internal security threats – have been guided by seniority and merit. Congratulating the beneficiaries, Adamu charged them to deploy their intellect and sound professional judgment all times in decision-making. Those that donned their new ranks include DIG Adeleye Olusola Oyebade, who prior to his lifting, was a directing staff at the National Institute of Policy and Strategic Studies (NIPPS). He has also been deployed as the DIG in charge of the Department of Research and Planning at the headquarters. Additionally, to satisfy geo-political balancing, Oyebade is doubling as the DIG in-charge of the South West.  The vacuum was created by the recent retirement of DIG Peter Babatunde Ogunyanwo. Aside the DIG, others are AIG Amba A.A Asuquo, AIG Nkereuwem A. Akpan, AIG Olafimihan Adeniran Adeoye, and AIG Aishatu Abubakar. The rest were CP Jonathan Towuru, CP Sikiru Kayode Akande, DCP Johnson Oluwole Adenola, and DCP Grema Jibir Isa.
