Katsina State Government has squandered N52.6 billion in the last five years from the state’s security escrow account, a Kaduna-based business mogul and Chairman of Dialogue Group Limited, Alhaji Mahdi Shehu, has alleged in a petition to Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). Addressing newsmen in Kaduna, Shehu stated that while Katsina was battling with insecurity, the Aminu Masari-led government spent hundreds of millions of naira on frivolities. The Katsina-born businessman, however, asked Masari to resign his position as governor and sack the Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Alhaji Mustapha Inuwa. Meanwhile, the SSG, who had on Monday responded to Shehu’s earlier allegations of corruption against the state government, debunked the allegations, saying that the government had only received N6 billion as security vote in the last five years. Inuwa had said, “The allegation that the state government embezzled more than N40 billion, with hundreds of millions credited into accounts of public office holders, is frivolous and unfounded. “We promised to expend public monies in a transparent manner and the details of what goes in and out of government coffers is there for all to see.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
