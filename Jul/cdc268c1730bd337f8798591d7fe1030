The Lagos State Safety Commission (LSC) has sealed 33 social and religious facilities across the state. The facilities, comprising bars, lounges, restaurants, gyms and spas, were sealed for engaging in activities and operations against the state’s established COVID-19 reopening protocols. The Director-General of LSC, Mr Lanre Mojola, while on an enforcement drive, affirmed that the state would not hesitate to deal with erring or non-compliant facilities that contravene the established protocols for reopening the economy. He reiterated that Lagos has zero tolerance for establishments that continue to violate the regulations. Mojola noted that further to the governor’s last briefing on the COVID-19 response, hairdressing salons that have been accredited by the LSC could now open strictly by appointment, only with a maximum occupancy of 40 per cent of the total floor space at any given time, while restaurants and eateries should continue to operate on a takeout basis. He implored business owners in the entertainment and tourism sector to continue to register on www.lasgsafetyreg.com to enable them to receive their provisional safety compliance letters in preparation for their full reopening. He reiterated that organisations that have collected their provisional compliance letters for sectors not opened yet should remain closed, but continuously ensure that the necessary safety protocols are put in place in anticipation for Mr Governor’s pronouncement for reopening of such businesses. The director-general warned that the commission would continue its enforcement across the state, identify businesses that have not registered and all erring facilities, especially bars, gyms, lounges, spas and other social and religious centres.
