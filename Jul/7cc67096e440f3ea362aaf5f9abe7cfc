Smiles were brought to the faces of children of His Grace Orphanage, Lagos, as president of the Rotary Club of Isolo, David Olaniyi Taiwo, led members and well-wishers to celebrate his birthday with the disadvantaged kids. Besides the party fun, many gifts and food items were donated to the home. Taiwo said his choice of marking his birthday with the kids in the orphanage was premised on his belief in giving recognition to people who are not as privileged as himself as well as lending helping hands to the downtrodden. “I see them as orphans, motherless children who may lack some things that others have and this prompted me to solicit the assistance of my friends to support me by donating essential items to make these children happy. “We also seized the occasion to plant a tree at this home to celebrate the world ecology month in July with the chairman, Inner Wheel Club, District 912, Isolo, Mrs Abiola Opeifa,” he said. Opeifa reiterated the need to encourage more Nigerians to continue reaching out to the underprivileged so they could know that some people have them in mind during this difficult period of the pandemic.
