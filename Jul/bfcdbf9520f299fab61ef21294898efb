 Real Madrid’s Brazilian defender Marcelo (R) lies on the ground after falling during the Spanish League football match between Athletic Club Bilbao and Real Madrid at the San Mames stadium in Bilbao on July 5, 2020.

Madrid’s last league game will be away at Leganes on July 19. Ferland Mendy is Marcelo’s likely replacement, the Frenchman who has enjoyed an impressive opening year in Spain. Marcelo will be hoping to regain fitness in time for Madrid’s Champions League last 16-second leg away at Manchester City on August 7. City won the first leg 2-1.
