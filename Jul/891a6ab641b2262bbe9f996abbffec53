For the government to address the increasing rate of unemployment and poverty in the country, serious attention and support must be given to organised businesses to thrive and flourish, the Nigeria Employers’ Consultative Association (NECA), has said.
 
NECA said the support is necessary considering the current regulatory environment characterised by strangulation and crass exploitation of businesses.
 
The Association also urged that specific palliatives and job retention schemes should be made available to organised businesses to fast-track economic recovery and promote job creation.  “Cost of production remains high, capacity utilisation is at the lowest ebb and the regulatory environment is consistently hostile.
 
“A report by the World Bank Enterprise Survey showed that 322 organised businesses were shut down between 2004 and 2019, with another 136 reported to be at the risk of closing down. This, to say the least, is a highly conservative number as the total closures would have significantly increased with attendant job losses. “Government needs to pay attention to the private sector. For every ten jobs created, nine come from the private sector. The implementation of all the things PEBEC is coming up with stops at the point where government agencies need to be implementing those orders; they frustrate it and throw it at us. For instance, goods arrive at the Nigerian ports and it takes forever to get them out, it is a total mess,” NECA said.
