These fears have been duplicated by Kanye’s fans as they shared their worries about his mental health after he claimed that he ‘ tried to kill his daughter ‘ and that his father wanted him aborted. Despite missing the deadline in several key states to have his name on the ballot paper, Kanye pushed ahead with the rally at the Exquis Event Center in North Charleston, which was for registered guests only according to a report by The Mirror. During a tearful moment in an emotionally charged rally, the Yeezy founder also claimed “I almost killed my daughter” as he spoke about wanting wife Kim Kardashian to abort their first child before an ‘intervention by God’ showed him the error of his ways. Earlier, Kanye had kicked-off the event by declaring: “I don’t give a f*** if I win the presidency or not. There are homeless people in front of the Gucci store. I care about these things. And I am in service of God. God has a plan for us, as his people, to be finally free. 50 Cent has already poured scorn on Kanye’s political ambitions and the 45-year-old rapper was quick to troll his rival as videos from the event circulated on social media. Reposting a clip of Kanye speaking on stage, 50 Cent, whose real name is Curtis Jackson, wrote: what the f*** did he just say. This is all Jay z fault , kanye’s first Rally. LOL #bransoncognac #lecheminduroi. Their feud dates back to 2007 when they released records at the same time. On 11 September of that year, Fiddy released ‘Curtis’ while West pushed the release of ‘Graduation’ forward by a week to pit the two records against each other. It was West that ultimately triumphed as ‘Graduation’ sold a staggering 957,000 units while 50 Cent shifted 691,000 units.
