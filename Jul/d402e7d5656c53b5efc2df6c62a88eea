The National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) has presented more than 10,000 face masks made by its members to the Sports Ministry as part of their contributions to the fight against the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. The face masks are to be distributed to athletes. In a ceremony at the Ministry of Sports in Abuja yesterday, the NYSC Director General, Brigadier General Ibrahim Shuaibu, handed over the masks to the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry, Mr. Gabriel Aduda, who stood in for the Minister, Mr. Sunday Dare. The hand made face masks were produced by the corps members to support athletes against the spread of COVID-19 during the Edo 2020 National Sports Festival when it finally holds. The festival was postponed due to the outbreak of the coronavirus. Receiving the masks, Aduda said he was impressed by the NYSC members’ kind gesture to complement the ministry’s efforts at safeguarding the health of Nigerian athletes.  He affirmed that the effort would further complement the local content production being championed by President Muhamnadu Buhari. The ministry had earlier requested for 20, 000 face masks, but 10, 000 pieces were delivered. Speaking at the ceremony, Brigadier General Shaibu applauded the Ministry for giving opportunity to the Corps members to contribute towards making the society safe.
