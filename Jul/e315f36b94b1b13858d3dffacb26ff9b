Sam Smith and Burna Boy The wait is finally over as Grammy award-winning British music star Sam Smith and Nigeria’s Grammy-nominated act Burna Boy have released their anticipated collaboration, My Oasis. When the two musicians announced the collaboration, fans worldwide were amazed and expressed excitement as no one saw it come. In an Instagram post on Wednesday, the “To Die For” crooner shared an Instagram video teasing the new single, “My Oasis.” Throughout the black-and-pink teaser video, fans can hear what sounds like the opening of the track, with some hypnotic bells and a skipping bassline. “This track has been a beautiful release of emotions for me during this time,” Sam Smith said in a statement. “I’ve been a fan of Burna Boy for years now and am so happy to have a tune with him.” Smith and Burna Boy wrote the song with Jimmy Napes. “My Oasis” comes following Smith’s decision back in March to postpone and rename their third studio album. Originally titled To Die For and slated for a May 1 release, the singer revealed in an Instagram post that the timing and title of the album didn’t “feel right” to them, but promised fans that “I am still going to bring out some new music over the next few months.” Listen to the new song below:
