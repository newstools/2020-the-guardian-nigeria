Russel And Ciara Wilson Welcome Second Child Together Russel Wilson and Ciara Wilson announced on Friday that they welcomed their new baby boy and revealed his name is Win Harrison Wilson. The singer took to social media on Friday (July 24) to share the happy news. “Happy Birthday WIN!!! Mommy & Daddy Love You!” she wrote, revealing the baby’s name, birth date, and weight. The singer posted a touching video on Instagram as she sang the baby boy happy birthday while cradling him in her arms moments after giving birth. Win, born Thursday, weighed in at 8 lbs., 1 oz. Win Harrison Wilson joins the singer’s two other children, her five-year-old son Future Zahir Wilburn, whom she had with her ex Future, and her three-year-old daughter Sienna Princess Wilson with her husband and NFL player. Her pregnancy was announced earlier this year in January when she revealed her baby bump in a bikini shot from her vacation in the Turks and Caicos Islands with the caption, “Number 3.” Ciara Image Instagram Ciara met Wilson in March 2015, following her separation from then-fiancé Future, with whom she shares son Future Jr. Her baby boy was 10 months old when the NFL star met Ciara’s family. At the time they were just friends. However, shortly after, they made their love official in April 2015, the couple discussed their decision to abstain from sex and wait until marriage to consummate their love. Their vow and commitment to each other became permanent when Wilson proposed to the “Goodies” singer in March 2016. A couple of months later, in July 2016, the pair tied the knot in a ceremony at Peckforton Castle in Cheshire, England according to report by ET online.
