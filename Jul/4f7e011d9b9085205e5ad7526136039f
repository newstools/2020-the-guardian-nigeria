… Optimistic to scale through 2021 recapitalisation exercise
The ongoing recapitalisation exercise in the insurance industry may be getting the necessary boost, as the life underwriters at the weekend expressed readiness for the exercise through their 2019 financial result; saying a process is a form of a corporate reorganisation, which involves making substantial changes in the capital structure. Recapitalisation is one of the strategies companies use to improve their financial stability. The insurance industry post-recapitalisation is expected to be robust and capable of taking big risks, as well as contribute meaningfully to the nation’s Gross Domestic Product. The decision to recapitalise may be taken by the company voluntarily, or in compliance with a regulatory directive. In the latter sense, recapitalisation has proven to be a useful tool in the hands of the authorities for sectoral reformation to sustain adequate economic growth and development. Following the September 30, 2021 recapitalisation deadline given by the National Insurance Commission (NAICOM), to all underwriting companies to upgrade their capital to a new threshold, only a few of the life underwriters are woo Nigerians with their performance in their Gross Premium Written (GPW) in 2019 financial year as it was better compared to 2018 same year. The regulatory body had said Life insurance companies were required to increase their minimum capital requirement from N2 billion to N8 billion, amounting to 400 per cent increase while other operators such as those with a composite licence to upgrade their capital base from N5 billion to N18 billion. Similarly, General insurance companies are to raise their capital base to N10 billion from N3 billion, while Reinsurance firms will now need N20 billion minimum capital to operate in Nigeria. Among few life insurance operators showing eagerness for the recapitalisation exercise are: African Alliance Insurance Plc, FBN insurance Limited and Mutual Benefits Life Assurance Limited, Speaking with The Guardian over the weekend, the Executive Director, Finance, African Alliance Insurance, Olabisi Areole, attributed the increased revenue to shrewd underwriting and better communication of the value of insurance to the retail market. “We have grown the retail business to become much more profitable and have supported their sales efforts with targeted communication both above the line and below the line. Adekola noted “The bulk of claims were in annuity the business of which has been affected by the operating environment vis-à-vis the average market rate and limited investment vehicles. We all know annuity business is basically about hedging assets against contract liabilities, so when the market forces are unfavourable, returns on investment will be affected too.” She stressed that in compliance with the new minimum capital requirements, the company has recorded N7.29billion premium in 2019 against N5.17billion in 2018 representing a 41% growth year on year while its life fund grew by 16% from N38.99billion to N45.33billion in the same period under review. The increase in both premium generated and the life fund lend credence to the company’s strong customer base, continued acceptance, as well as a robust sales, drive across both retail and corporate lines of business. The firm demonstrated relentless commitment to its teeming consumers by paying claims totalling N9.36billion as against N8.78billion the previous year, a 7% increase year-on-year rise. She further expressed confidence in the firm’s ability to turn the bend going by its corporate strategy. “Our strategy has been to keep growing our market share via aggressive sales drive, adoption of digital technology and capital injection. We own viable assets home and abroad which we are certain would aid our quest to capitalize. Indeed, our recapitalization plan is key to our bounce-back strategy,” she said.
