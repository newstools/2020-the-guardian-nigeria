Lagos State chapter of All Progressives Congress (APC) said it has not selected any candidate to replace the late Senator Bayo Osinowo, who represented Lagos East zone until his death last month. In a statement on Saturday, the party’s Publicity Secretary, Mr Seye Oladejo said Lagos APC’S attention has been drawn to the various speculations as regards the emergence of a candidate for the yet to be scheduled Lagos East senatorial by-election. The party’s reaction was based on a social media report, which claimed that it has elected a former Lagos Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mr Dele Alake to replace Osinowo. “Lagos APC will like to state emphatically that the process of selecting a candidate is yet to commence for a number of reasons,” Oladejo said. “First, we are still mourning the demise of  Osinowo whose sudden departure sent shock waves through the fabrics of the party. The Independent National Electoral Commission (NEC) is yet to officially notify the party of  the scheduled time for the by-election.” Oladejo added that the constitution of the party is explicit about the process for the emergence of candidates for elections. He said, “We are irrevocably committed to abiding by this. The nomination is either by consensus or  a primary among the aspirants.” “The party acknowledges the interest the by-election may generate as the ruling party, but we want to urge all and sundry to play by the rules. We wish to reiterate our commitment to provide, at the appointed time, a level playing field for all the aspirants to engender internal democracy. “We want to assure the media, party men and women and other interests that we will communicate the plan and process and program of the party towards the by-election at the appropriate time,” he added.
