Speaker, Lagos State House of Assembly, Mudashiru Obasa and the lawmaker, representing Lagos Mainland Constituency II, Mr. Moshood Oshun, have dismissed the news trending on social media that there was a personal rift between them or any division in the Assembly. Oshun, while addressing the media yesterday in reaction to viral online publications, which claimed that he (Oshun) walked out on Obasa during a plenary, said there was nothing like that. To corroborate Oshun, the Chief Press Secretary to the Speaker, Mr. Tolani Abati, also dismissed as fake news and unfounded report that there was misunderstanding between his boss and any of the legislators, saying: “The matter has been trashed out at the plenary. “Nothing could have warranted me to walk out on the Speaker during plenary. I can tell you that there is no personal issue between the Speaker and myself.”
Oshun also denied the reports that he said the late Tunde Buraimoh died of COVID-19 complications. According to him: “I never told anybody that Buraimoh died of COVID-19. I am not a medical doctor neither did I see his (Buraimoh) death certificate. So, how would I say he died of COVID-19.“I don’t know why I am a victim of fake news. I have always been a victim of fake news. I am not thinking of any motion.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
