In his latest Twitter outburst, West said Kim was ‘out of line’ to meet Meek Mill to talk about ‘prison reform’, and blasted her mother Kris Jenner as ‘Kris Jong-Un’ while accusing the pair of ‘white supremacy’. West also repeated his claim that his wife and mother-in-law had ‘tried to fly in with two doctors’ to have him hospitalized amid concerns about his well-being after his bizarre entry into the presidential race. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-1189614 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image-from-iOS-2-637x598.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="1201" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image-from-iOS-2-637x598.jpg 637w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image-from-iOS-2-487x457.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image-from-iOS-2-974x914.jpg 974w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image-from-iOS-2-256x240.jpg 256w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image-from-iOS-2-511x480.jpg 511w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image-from-iOS-2-600x563.jpg 600w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image-from-iOS-2.jpg 1125w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> ‘Kris and Kim put out a statement without my approval, that’s not what a wife should do,’ Kanye said after reports that the Kardashians were infuriated by his latest antics. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-1189616 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image-from-iOS-1062x539.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="650" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image-from-iOS-1062x539.jpg 1062w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image-from-iOS-487x247.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image-from-iOS-974x494.jpg 974w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image-from-iOS-320x162.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image-from-iOS-640x325.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image-from-iOS-600x305.jpg 600w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image-from-iOS.jpg 1125w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> The 43-year-old deleted his late-night tweets barely half an hour after posting them, except for a final post in which he signed them off as coming from ‘the future president’. Kim, 39, earned glowing praise from Meek Mill for her work on criminal justice reform last year, when the rapper hailed her for ‘doing a lot of good work’ on the issue. Both attended a Criminal Justice Reform Summit in LA in 2018, but it was at the Jeremy Hotel rather than the Waldorf in Beverly Hills which Kanye appeared to be referring to, leaving the nature of the meeting unclear. Kanye’s tweets said that ‘Meek is my man and was respectful… that’s my dog’, without elaborating further before he veered off into his $5billion wealth and a reference to Michael Jackson. Kanye questioned whether he should postpone his controversial run on the Oval Office until 2024 in a tweet late Tuesday night in which he also shared a confusing look at his ‘2020 Vision’. ‘#2020vision or maybe ’24,’ he wrote alongside a picture of a piece of paper in his trademark orange, listing what appears to be the tracklist for his upcoming album. ‘I guess all black people supposed to vote on Biden? Y’all want me to run on nah???’ the rapper then asked. He shared the list again later Tuesday as he repeated that he had a new album being released this Friday.
