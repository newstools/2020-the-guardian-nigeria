The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) has warned tertiary institutions against charging more than N2,000 for post- Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) screening. It maintained that it was unlawful to make candidates directly or indirectly incur further expenses in the name of administrative and bank charges. The warning was contained in the organisation’s guidelines for the 2020 admission process released yesterday in Abuja. “Any institutions interested in conducting any forms of screening could do so, but the gross charge for the screening should not exceed N2,000 only,” it clarified. JAMB warned heads of institutions of higher learning in the country to ensure total compliance, adding:  “Sanctions will be applied to institutions that violate the rules.” The board explained that all applications for admissions to the first degree, national diploma, national innovation diploma and the Nigerian Certificate in Education (NCE) into full time, distance learning, part-time, outreach, sandwich and others must be processed through it only.
