Chairman of the Nigerian Economic Summit Group (NESG), Asue Ighodolo, has warned that the country’s manufacturing and trade sectors might suffer a decline if the country fails to initiate and implement the right policies to cushion them from the effects of COVID-19 pandemic. Ighodolo stated this yesterday in Abuja at the formal inauguration of the Joint Planning Committee (JPC) for the 26th Nigerian Economic Summit (NES26). He noted that COVID-19 pandemic would pose more difficulties to the global economy ahead, adding that with the current situation of the economy, the nation should adopt a better approach to reflate, build and strengthen the economy. He said: “We must take and implement the right decisions and weed out all tendencies that draw us back as a nation.  All hands must be on deck; all those who place their personal interests above national goals must be identified and removed from where they can cause further damage. “It is our hope that the 26th NESG would be a big conversation and action for public and private sector, CSOs, media, stakeholders and all Nigerians; so we can reflect on the state of the Nigerian economy and deliberate the impact of the global pandemic on the economy as we explore emerging trends that will enable Nigeria capitalise on new opportunities and chart a path.” Inaugurating the committee, the Minister of State for Budget and National Planning, Clem Ikanade Agba, disclosed that NES26 would hold from October 26 to 27, 2020, with the theme, ‘Building Partnerships for Resilience’.
