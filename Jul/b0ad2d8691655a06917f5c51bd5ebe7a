Medical workers under the aegis of Joint Health Sector Unions (JOHESU), have accused the Federal Government of prioritising the welfare of medical doctors over other health workers in the sector.
 
National President of JOHESU, Josiah Biobelemoye, who made the accusation in Abuja, decried the alleged discrimination in the health sector.
 
He accused the Federal Government of trying to redefine the term, ‘health workers’, especially since the issues of hazard allowances for those managing COVID-19 patients cropped up.  “Today some machinations have been taking place to redefine who a health worker is, some said other workers should be paid 10 percent, for instance the laundry people who collect materials or waste products from isolation centres, these people are sometimes infected in the course of carrying out their job, for somebody to now say they are not the real health workers beats my imagination, some are biological engineers who decontaminate the isolation centres, all these discriminations, segregation is now breeding crisis in the sector,” he stated.
