Emir of Dutse, Alhaji Nuhu Sanusi, is a firm advocate for youth empowerment. The royal father, an ardent golfer, believes that if given the enabling environment, Nigerian youths can lift the country using their talents. And so, he wants to provide that environment for the youths, starting from his home state.
 
Recently, Alhaji Sanusi began his quest to lift Jigawa youths out of poverty by acquiring the equipment for a proposed golf acade­my, which will help unearth and develop fresh talents from the grassroots. Speaking through one of his aids, Suleiman Uba, the Emir disclosed that the path has already been laid, adding, “It’s the Coronavi­rus pandemic that is de­laying the take off of the academy.” According to Uba, “His Highness re­cently made it clear after his return from abroad that all the equipment needed for the academy have been acquired; the students of the academy will have everything free to encourage them. “This is because the golf academy is one of the ways the Emir wants to take the people of Dutse off the streets; the young ones and the youths need to be gain­fully engaged for their future to be useful for them, their families and the society.” Uba disclosed that many children in Dutse have embraced the sport, which has encouraged the Emir to speed up the academy programme for commencement. Part of the expected golf revolution in Jigawa State, according to Uba, is the renovation of the Dutse Royal Golf Course to meet modern, acceptable standard. “The interest in golf among Jigawa kids and youths at the moment is very, very interesting; a lot of them are now play­ing golf very well. “In fact, it is the inter­est from the people that even made the Emir to be so interested in ensuring that the academy starts soonest. It would have long started because ev­erything, from what the Emir confided in me, the academy is good to go. It is the Coronavirus which has affected everything aspect of our lives glob­ally that is delaying it,” he explained. He revealed that some trees have been cut down at the Royal Golf Course to reduce the hazards, adding, “the fairways, the greens have taken a new look; as I speak routine mainte­nance is on-going to give the course the standard look it should have.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
