President Muhammadu Buhari is presiding over a closed-door meeting with former President Goodluck Jonathan at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. Jonathan arrived at Aso Rock about 11 am and proceeded to President Buhariâ€™s office. The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), had recently appointed the Nigerian former President to head the political reconciliation in Mali where there is a leadership crisis. The Jonathan-led committee had recommended the government of national unity in the country but the opposition group had turned down the recommendation. Although the agenda of the meeting currently ongoing is not disclosed, our correspondent gathered that the former President is expected to brief Buhari on the efforts of his committee in the Mali crisis.
