A 57-year-old man, Joseph Akporugo and his wife, Janet, have been arrested by men of Ogun State Police Command for maltreating their seven-year-old granddaughter. The little girl, with wounds all over her body, walked into the house of a police constable living very close to their house in Awa-Ijebu and reported to him about the maltreatment meted out to her by her grandfather and his wife, who she has been living with since the death of her father. She narrated how the couple put rubber on fire and used it to burn her body on the allegation that she was a witch and that she used her witchcraft to kill her father. The constable brought her to Awa-Ijebu Police Station, where the case was documented. The Divisional Police Officer, Adewalehinmi, subsequently detailed detectives to the coupleâ€™s house and they were arrested. On interrogation, the couple were unable to justify their maltreatment of the girl.The Commissioner of Police, Kenneth Ebrimson, has ordered a proper investigation of the case with the view to diligently prosecuting the suspects.
