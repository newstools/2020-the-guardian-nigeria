As deaths and infections rise significantly due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Centre for Values in Leadership (CVL), Art of Living Foundation and others in a Coalition of Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) have provided succour to the vulnerable in three communities threatened by the virus in Lagos State. The founder of CVL, Prof. Patrick Utomi, in his address to recipients from Makoko and Iwaya, educated the beneficiaries on the importance of observing the established guidelines and protocols for safety against COVID-19. According to him, the government needed support from citizens, and that was the reason CVL was distributing foodstuffs, to teach the young on the importance of leadership, which is about care for others and not self-love. The distribution also extended to Oshodi community and Surulere Widow Support Centre. Organisations like Toleram Group, Indomie, Soroptimist International, Hope Emerge Initiative, Africa Venture Philanthropy Alliance (AVPA), Ford Foundation and the American Business Council also helped in the provision of food items to hundreds of widows in the Pat Utomi Widow Support Centre network. In her appreciation, the Iyalode of Iwaya community commended the conveners for the timely initiative, which, she said, had brought smiles to the faces of so many vulnerable citizens in these trying times. She said: “If the government can organise such initiatives in communities on how to protect themselves and also distribute relief materials, most residents won’t find it difficult adhering to the safety guidelines on frequent hand washing, use of nose masks and social distancing.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
