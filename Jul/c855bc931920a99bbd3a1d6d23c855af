August Alsina, Jada Pinkett and Will Smith | Image: Ebony Magazine Jada Pinkett Smith has denied the claims made by August Alsina that the two had a romantic relationship which Will Smith gave his blessings to. Jada Smith’s representatives have said that the claim is “absolutely not true”, TMZ reports. Jada Smith and Alsina’s friendship have spawned speculations over the years. However, during a recent interview with The Breakfast Club’s Angela Yee, Alsina claimed that he did, in fact, have a romantic relationship with the 48-year-old Red Table Talk host — and Will knew about it. “I actually sat down with Will and had a conversation … He gave me his blessing,” he said. “And I totally gave myself to that relationship for years of my life, and I truly and really, really, deeply loved and have a ton of love for her (Jada). I devoted myself to it. I gave my full self to it. So much so that I can die right now, and be OK knowing that I fully gave myself to somebody … Some people never get that in this lifetime.” When asked if it was “disappointing” that Jada never publicly acknowledged the long-running rumours of a romance. He said: “I really can’t even get into the thought of that because I am only responsible for myself, right? And I am only responsible for what I do. When I am repressing and suppressing things and it starts to affect me. I have to address it. I just always stay solid because I never want to be the person to start confusion.” August Alsina met Jada in 2015 through her son, Jaden Smith. He became close with the family, vacationing with them in Hawaii a year later and attending the BET Awards with the fam two years later.
