Ahead of the 2030 date for the attainment of the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), stakeholders in the critical sectors of the economy have been urged to collaborate for Nigeria to achieve the feat. The Senior Special Assistant (SSA) on SDGs to the President, Princess Adejoke Orelope Adefulire, made the appeal during a webinar at the weekend in Abuja. With the theme, “Achieving Sustainable Development in Nigeria”, the erstwhile Lagos State deputy governor said blueprint could not be attained at the federal level without the full participation of stakeholders and state actors, including sub-national and local governments as well as non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and development partners. She observed that the most populous black nation would not be at ease until a substantial part of the goals was accomplished. The United Nations General Assembly had in September 2015, adopted the proposal to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure prosperity for all in the next decade. Though there is Agenda 2060, if everybody in Nigeria works together, the country can achieve a larger part of the SDGs before the targeted time. “Nigeria cannot afford to fail. If Nigeria fails, Africa has failed,” she stated. Other speakers, consisting of UNICEF’s Judith Giwa Amu, World Bank’s Ubah Thomas Ubah, and United Nations Development Programme’s (UNDP) Amarakoon Bandara, corroborated the presidential aide. The organiser, Omoseindemi Olobayo, urged participants to explore the innovation that would hasten the achievement of the notable proposition.
