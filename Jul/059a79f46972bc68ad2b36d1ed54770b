Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, on Friday announced the partial reopening of schools for students in transitional classes. Sanwo-Olu said students in SSS 3 and Tech III can resume to classes on August 3. “But for JSS 3, we’ll wait for another one or two weeks and we’ll see how we’ve taken the first set of Tech 3 and SSS 3 before they now subsequently would open,” Sanwo-Olu said. Sanwo-Olu said the window period is for schools authorities “to be able to prepare themselves well and get the right directives from our ministry of education and the quality assurance office under the ministry of education.” For students in tertiary institutions, the governor said “they’ll continue to enjoy their online academic activities”, pending the decision taken on physical resumption. The Federal Ministry of Education on March 19 ordered closure of all tertiary, secondary and primary schools nationwide over the outbreak of the coronavirus in the country. The ministry said it is part of measures to contain the spread of the virus. But last week, the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 said schools can be reopened for graduating students in primary and secondary schools across the country. The Federal Ministry of Education issued guidelines for the reopening and it required schools to adopt the use of distant learning centres and temporary shelters. It advocates disinfection and fumigation of facilities including hostel accommodation, with particular attention on those used as temporary isolation and treatment centres. Critics have since faulted the government’s decision. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
