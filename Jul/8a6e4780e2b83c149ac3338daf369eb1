Ekiti State governor’s wife, Erelu Bisi Fayemi would be speaking at a webinar on Gender Based Violence (GBV) organised by Media Women Forum, in partnership with Women Radio 91.7. With the theme, ‘’Blame the Perpetrators, Not the Victim,” the webinar is aimed at examining the argument in some quarters that actions of victims of domestic violence might have given rise to such aggression as well as stimulating conversations for women in media on the importance of protecting her and condemning GBV.
    
The webinar, which will hold today by 6.p.m., will be moderated by Adesuwa Onyenokwe and will also focus on the roles and responsibilities of the citizenry in protecting victims of GBV.
