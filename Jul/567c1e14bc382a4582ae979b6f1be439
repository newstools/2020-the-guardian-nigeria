One of the suspects, Timi Sunday, 27, from Agalabiri community in Ekeremor said he was lured to the crime by his friend named Innocent who urged him to accompany him to sell scraps in Bayelsa. Timi, who is a father of nine children, said he never knew that the oil well heads and valves are stolen items. Speaking with journalists, operations team leader of Aiteo Oil Services, Victor Ehiemere commended the police and Amotoi Global Services Ltd for their efforts in protecting the nation’s assets.

Diri, who got a tumultuous reception upon his arrival in Yenagoa on Thursday night, said the demonstration of love and support was overwhelming and heartwarming.
