The centre said that increasing evidence suggested the possibility of airborne transmission of COVID-19 could not be ruled out yet. “Evidence on the airborne transmission of COVID-19 reinforces the need for strict adherence to preventive measures, such as avoidance of mass gatherings and the use of face masks. “We will continue to adapt our guidelines as scientific evidence emerges,” NCDC said.
