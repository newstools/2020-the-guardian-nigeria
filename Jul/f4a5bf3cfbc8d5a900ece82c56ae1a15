Christian Rights Agenda (CRA) has asked President Muhammadu Buhari to urgently review “lopsided appointments” made by his administration. In a statement in Abuja yesterday, the group’s interim Director of Publicity, Tom Chiahemen, indicated that available data showed that the president’s appointments, especially in his second term, were heavily skewed against Christians. He, therefore, challenged the presidency to make public the list of all federal agencies and parastatals and their heads, noting that appointment of assistants could not in any way be equated with those of heads of parastatals and agencies. “For a nation that claims secularity as a principle, this development is not only worrisome but a precursor to a feeling of marginalisation and its consequences,” CRA asserted. “The president ought to (and should) see himself as the father of the nation, but his body language and appointments since 2015 have left much to be desired. “The Federal Character as enshrined in Section (14)(3) of the 1999 Constitution which states, ‘The composition of the government of the federation or any of its agencies and the conduct of its affairs shall be carried out in such a manner as to reflect the federal character of Nigeria and the need to promote national unity, and also to command national loyalty, thereby ensuring no predominance of persons from a few states or from a few ethnic or other sectional groups in that government or in any of its agencies.’”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
