The Federal Government has directed Reynolds Construction Company (RCC) to immediately start fixing the bad portions of the Ososa River bridges on the Sagamu-Benin Expressway. This is contained in a statement issued in Abeokuta on Monday by Mr Ahmed Umar, the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) Sector Commander in Ogun. He explained that the measure was to reduce motorists’ vulnerability of plunging into the river. Umar with some of his officers; the Federal Comptroller of Works in Ogun, Mr Bakare  Umar and a representative of RCC had earlier conducted an assessment tour of  the three faulty bridges on  Ososa River. He said that the tour was sequel to a crash that claimed four lives there last Wednesday. “The Federal Comptroller of Works has directed the management of RCC to begin immediate palliative works on the bridges as agreed to reduce motorists’ vulnerability to traffic injuries and deaths there. “One of such moves is the temporary placement of movable concrete barriers at the edges of the bridges to create a better motoring environment and prevent vehicles from free fall into the river in the event of crashes. “A good number of concrete barriers are being placed on the edges of the bridges by a team of engineers from RCC at the moment. “Traffic has been temporarily diverted for a seamless palliative exercise,” he said. The sector commander advised motorists to exercise caution while approaching the Ososa bridges, saying that the FRSC traffic control operatives from Ijebu Ode were there to control traffic.
