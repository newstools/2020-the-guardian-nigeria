Operatives of Ogun State Police Command yesterday shot dead a suspected kidnapper along Shagamu-Ijebu Ode Road and rescued two of their victims. The incident happened when the Divisional Police Officer, Shagamu, Okiki Agunbiade, was on routine patrol with his men and sighted a Sienna bus with registration number MUS 86 FN with some occupants whose suspicious look attracted the attention of the policemen and prompted them to stop the vehicle. But instead of the driver to stop, he sped off towards Ijebu-Ode Road, consequent upon which the DPO ordered his men to chase them. Having realised that they were being pursued, the men in the car started firing at the policemen, while on the move and the policemen fired back. They later jumped down, abandoned the car and ran into the bush while the policemen chased them into the bush and shot one of them dead while others escaped with gunshot injuries. Rescued from the abandoned car are a youth corps member identified as Okoroji Agnes, attached to Federal Girls College, Sagamu and one Tawa Sosanwo. The two victims narrated how they were kidnapped at various locations by the hoodlums and were being taken to an unknown destination before the police intercepted them on the road. Their operational car was recovered with one black toy gun, one gold wrist watch, one Samsung Galaxy S7 phone, one cutlass, and one black wrist watch. Meanwhile, the Commissioner of Police, Kenneth Ebrimson, who was full of praise for the gallant display of his men, has appealed to members of the public, especially hospitals, to inform the police of anybody with gunshots injury seen in their area. He also assured members of the public that the fleeing members of the gang would be hunted and arrested within the shortest possible time.
