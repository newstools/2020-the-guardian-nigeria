The Ogun State Government has restated its commitment to addressing the hardship being faced by road users across the state. It said the administration of Governor Dapo Abiodun was fully aware of the challenges occasioned by the deplorable condition of Sango-Agbado Expressway and other roads. The Commissioner for Works and Infrastructure, Ade Akinsanya, had on Friday inspected the progress of the project. This followed his earlier inspection of the Ojodu-Abiodun-Denro Ishasi-Akute and Oke Aro-Lambe-Matogun roads two weeks ago, as engineers from the ministry visited the area to further assess the roads. Akinsanya, who said it is worthy of note that the construction of the 32km Sango-Agbado road was started by the immediate past administration of Senator Ibikunle Amosun, decried how the project was left unattended to months before the end of Amosun’s administration. He said: “The Prince Dapo Abiodun-led Administration is now engaging contractors, as the government evaluates how to rescope, accelerate and get the contractors back to site towards completing the road for use by the people. “The completion of the road will revive economic activities in the axis, while ensuring the safety of persons and vehicles. “These talks are inevitable, as there remains an outstanding payment of about N2.83 billion on the road project, and N26 billion for it to be completed as designed.” The commissioner, therefore, urged members of the public to remain calm as the state government works out modalities on the continuation of the abandoned road projects.
