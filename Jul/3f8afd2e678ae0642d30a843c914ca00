Chairman of the Ebonyi State Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Onyekachi Nwebonyi, has commended President Muhammadu Buhari for the progress of the second Niger Bridge, which is nearing completion, adding that he had done well for the South East region. Speaking with journalists in Abakaliki yesterday, he said the party also praised the President for ensuring that the renovation of the Akanu Ibiam International Airport, Enugu, was on course, as it would benefit the people of the South East and the country, and add value to the nation’s economy. Nwebonyi, however, explained that the PDP, in spite of being an opposition party at the federal level, was still at liberty to point out areas where the Federal Government had performed well. On National Assembly’s clamour for sack of service chiefs, he explained that the decision remained President Buhari’s constitutional responsibility. “We appreciate the President for his good works in the South East region. The ongoing construction of the second Niger Bridge is a dream come true for the people of the region. “Some of us thought that the project was not real, but the case is different now. Once the project is completed, the zone will have so much to be grateful for. “The reconstruction of the Akanu Ibiam International Airport in Enugu is another project that the zone is happy about. The pace of work is worthy of commendation and the people of the region are pleased about it. “The sack of the service chiefs remains the constitutional responsibility of the President. Whenever he decides otherwise, Nigerians will know. He should be allowed to do his job,” he stated. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
