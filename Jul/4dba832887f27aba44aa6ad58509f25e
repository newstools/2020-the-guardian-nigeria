The National Consultative Front of National Leaders of Conscience has disclosed that the body is essentially a consultative forum for a popular political intervention in the country, which is yet to transform into a political party as being widely speculated. In a statement yesterday, signed by Mallam Tanko Yunusa, NCF reiterated in clear terms that the mandate and task before the NCF at the moment is the mobilisation of all well-meaning Nigerians to join forces together to pull Nigeria out of the precipice of failures and political anarchy. “So, consultations in that regard are expected to be finalised by January 2021, when the emerging movement is expected to be finally launched and inaugurated as clearly stated in our last communiqué, which also announced the setting up of a provisional leadership to steer and move forward further consultations towards the formation and launching of a new popular political movement by January 2021.” He noted that the body is also not unmindful that “our sort of Citizens Movement may face its own trials and challenges at some point from possible reactionary machinations of adversarial agents of the State and Fifth columnists, who will desperately want to break our ranks and truncate this historic intervention for their selfish interests. “But we as Leaders of Conscience are deeply convinced and assured by the fact that when Conveners and Allies championing a popular initiative remain resolute and steadfast, such intervention always triumph over evil plots and machination to destabilise the popular objective.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
