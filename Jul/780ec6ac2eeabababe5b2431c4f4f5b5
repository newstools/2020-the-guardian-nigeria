Love And Oneness (LAO Foundation), founded by actress Linda Osifo, has made donations of seven sets of computers to the Little Saints Orphanage, Shasha, Akowonjo, Lagos. Overwhelmed with joy while receiving the donation, the founder of Little Saints Orphanage, Akowonjo, Revd. Dele George, said: “I am overjoyed as this is a timely intervention and we are indeed grateful for this donation. We lay so much emphasis on education at Little Saints because, without it, these children’s past will continue to haunt them and they won’t be able to live a financially independent life when they leave the orphanage.
 
“There is no way the history of Little Saints will be written without the mention of the LAO Foundation, and because of this act of kindness, we will be adding Linda Osifo’s name to our hall of fame.”
 
Speaking on behalf of the LAO Foundation, Osifo said: “I am glad to make this donation despite the many obstacles we encountered (trying) to bring this to fruition. At LAO Foundation, we believe love is what matters the most at the end of the day, and we believe togetherness also matters a lot. I wish we could have done more. However, we believe with small initiatives, others will be encouraged to do more. We do this every year in different communities, especially towards the time I celebrate my birthday. Looking at how impactful this orphanage has been, I will be coming back to do more. It is just the beginning of a great relationship.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
