The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) is ready to partner the Barca Academy Lagos in its quest to give the country’s youths the platform to develop their football skills. To this end, the NFF has written to the promoters of the elite academy, Blaugrana Sports Group, through the Lagos State Football Association, to pledge its support to the academy if it meets its requirements. The letter signed by the National Technical Director, Bitrus Bewarang, on behalf of the NFF General Secretary, said the federation is gathering data and collating information on some specific football academies in the country with the aim of helping them in their programmes. According to the NFF, Lagos State has only three football academies, which include the Pepsi Academy, Buruj and Barca. Speaking on the development, Chairman, Blaugrana Sports Group, Leslie Oghomienor, commended the NFF leadership for its contributions to the development and growth of the game in Nigeria. He appealed that the current tempo of development should be maintained for the good of the game, adding that such efforts could help the country win global competitions and also be found worthy of hosting major international competitions. He also praised the current Chairman, Lagos State Sports Commission, Sola Aiyepeku, for supporting the Barca Academy, adding, “Our emergence as one of the academies recognised by the NFF is an indication that the superior supervising bodies are happy and satisfied with what we are trying to do.” Oghomienor revealed that the NFF would appraise the academies based on genre, target and age category of participants among others.
