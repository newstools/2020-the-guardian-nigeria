To accelerate energy access by the un-served and underserved communities, Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI), Ibadan Electricity Distribution Company (IBEDC), and Nayo Tropical Technology, have partnered to bring Nigeria’s first rural commercial under-grid mini-grid.
 
The Nigerian Rural Electrification Agency, REA-supported project, powers Mokoloki Community, an area in Ogun State.
 
The project demonstrates a financially-viable business model that could provide electricity access to millions of people living in the underserved rural communities throughout Nigeria.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
