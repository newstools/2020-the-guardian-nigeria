Working with Partners  UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, works closely with the Office of the Commissioner for Refugees (COR) in the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) and other key government line ministries. UNHCR also works in partnership with the United Nations Country Team (UNCT) and I-NGOs, such as Action Africa Help, Plan International, Caritas Czech Republic, CARE International and World Vision Zambia. Most of the international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) and UN agencies provide community-based protection and basic assistance to refugees from the Democratic Republic of the Congo in Mantapala settlement, northern Zambia. The Government of Zambia, UNHCR and partners also provide community-based protection and basic social support to persons of concern in Lusaka as well as the older refugee settlements of Meheba and Mayukwayukwa, in Western and North Western Provinces. The coordination and management of all refugee settlements is led by the Government, specifically the Office of the Commissioner for Refugees (COR), which takes the lead in coordinating and managing the settlements, including efforts of the Government, UNHCR and other partners directed at addressing refugee needs. This mandate is inscribed in the Refugee Act (Act No. 1 Of 2017).

During the last week of May 2020, staff from COR and UNHCR undertook a joint border monitoring mission covering all reception centres in the regions of Luapula and Northern Provinces. A total of 53 asylum-seekers all from the DRC arrived within that week and were hosted at three of the five reception centres, bringing the total of arrivals in the two provinces in May to 66.

The SGBV Monitors were provided with masks, sanitizers and PSEA learning materials to safely continue community awareness-raising on SGBV and PSEA during the COVID-19 pandemic. UNHCR and the Ministry of Community Development and Social Services (MCDSS) jointly held a consultation with the groups of community mobilisers to discuss SGBV issues pertinent to SGBV prevention in Meheba and Mayukwayukwa. The dialogue will continue over the course of a year with the aim of promoting men’s participation in SGBV through revamping the Men’s Network. In Mantapala settlement, UNHCR selected 666 persons with specific needs (PSNs) to begin receiving cashbased-intervention (CBI). UNHCR established protection hotlines for the settlements and at country-level, to help refugees swiftly report protection-related complaints in view of COVID-19 and any SGBV or SEA incidents. Following the outbreak of COVID-19 in Zambia, over 300 personnel were trained in COVID-19 prevention and awareness in the three settlements and Lusaka. A total of 5,000 information, education and communication materials developed by UNHCR and partners were distributed to refugees and their Zambian hosts to raise awareness about COVID-19 Distributed by APO Group on behalf of United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
