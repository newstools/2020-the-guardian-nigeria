The National Union of Chemical Footwear Rubber Leather and Non-Metallic Products Employees (NUCFRLANMPE), has kicked against the planned mass sack and unfair anti-labour practices by the management of Nycil Chemical Company, located in Sango Ota, Ogun State.
 
The chemical workers said the company’s decision to sack workers at this critical time of COVID-19 when governments are putting measures to contain the dreaded disease, is against the Constitution of Nigeria, and an unfair labour practice on the employees. The management in an attempt to carry out its mass retrenchment, which it said was due to the effects of COVID-19, locked all its gates against the workers, who had arrived for the day’s activities.
