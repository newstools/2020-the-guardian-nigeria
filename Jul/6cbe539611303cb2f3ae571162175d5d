• Airlines shift rebound till 2024 The continued closure of international airports in Nigeria and other parts of the world has been blamed for the slow recovery of global aviation and passenger traffic.

Traffic fell 86.5 per cent compared to the year-ago period.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
