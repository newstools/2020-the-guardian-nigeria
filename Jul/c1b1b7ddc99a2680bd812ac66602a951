The Rotary Club of Lagos Central has provided palliatives to residents of Oke-Ira Nla and Oke-Ira Kekere communities in Ajah, Eti-Osa Local Government area of Lagos State. Director, Service Projects, Ademola Ali, said the targeted beneficiaries of the COVID-19 Relief Project are elderly indigent individuals, poor widows, vulnerable or incapacitated individuals after a rigorous process of identification and enumeration of potential beneficiaries from the communities. The disbursement of relief materials was carried out from house to house in a guided distribution to avoid a gathering of beneficiaries, which is against the COVID-19 safety protocol. “We kicked off with a visit to the residence of the Baale of Oke-Ira Nla community to intimate him of our project in the community and symbolically present some of the goody bags to him and his household. The Baale gave his blessings and prayed for God’s blessings to be upon all the members of the club for the humanitarian gesture. Thereafter, we proceeded with the house-to-house visits to present the goody bags to beneficiaries with warm compliments from the club.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
