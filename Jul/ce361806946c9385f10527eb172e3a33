The Borno State Police Command has restricted the movement of vehicles to ensure a hitch-free Eid-el-Kabir celebration in Maiduguri metropolis. The 6am to noon restriction today involves cars, tricycles, bicycles, wheelbarrows, horses, donkeys and camels. While announcing the restriction yesterday in Maiduguri, the Commissioner of Police (CP), Aliyu Mohammed, disclosed: “Residents of Maiduguri metropolis and Jere Council are hereby informed that there will be restriction of all categories of vehicles.” The CP, who was represented by the acting police spokesman, Yakubu Mohammed, noted that during the six-hour restriction, Muslims would have finished their prayers. He warned that no bag, weapon or sharp object would be allowed into praying grounds. On being safe at Eid-el-Kabir, he said: “Owing to the effect of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), worshippers are advised to go with their face masks to praying grounds. They are to observe physical distancing and other safety measures.” Urging the faithful to pray at the nearest community praying ground, he warned: “Failure to abide by COVID-19 protocols could prevent you from accessing the Eid praying grounds.” Borno State Governor Babagana Zulum’s convoy had been attacked on Wednesday by suspected Boko Haram terrorists, but his security details repelled the bandits and ferried the governor to safety.
