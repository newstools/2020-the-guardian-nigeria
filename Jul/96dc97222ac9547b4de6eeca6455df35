As Rotarians across the world mark the World Tree Planting Day with month-long events, members of the Rotary Club of Ewutuntun, District 9110, have beautified Mafoluku Grammar School, in Oshodi, with flowers to stem global warming, preserve the environment and propagate the life-saving benefits of trees to humanity.
 
President of the club, Dele Adegbola, said the project was in line with the new focus of Rotary International. “Because of the emergency of climate change, Rotary International has expanded its areas of focus to accommodate what is now called ‘Supporting the Environment.’ The decision to plant trees inside the premises of the school is also consistent with Rotary’s support for basic education.
