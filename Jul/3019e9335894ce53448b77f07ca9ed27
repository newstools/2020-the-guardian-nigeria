The District Governor, Lions Club, District 404 B2, Nigeria, Ademola Adesoye, has decried rising cases of diabetes among Nigerians.This has led to the determination to fight the disease to its knees in Kwara, Ekiti, Osun and Lagos states with no fewer than 20,000 beneficiaries of its mass screening and treatment. He made this known at a press briefing to usher in the new Lions Service Year, 2020-2021, at Insurance Brokers’ House, Yaba, Lagos. He said: “We are building a diabetes hospital for the people of Kwara State at General Hospital, Offa, where patients would be screened for diabetes mellitus. We are targeting 8,000 people to benefit from the treatment of the disease in Ekiti, Osun and Kwara, while 12,000 people would be screened in Lagos.” Adesola added that in line with the theme for his service year, ‘Reach out, Touch life, Kindness Matter because Kindness is Very Important,’ he would also be reaching out to about 100 people with sight challenges who would need cataract operations, apart from the gifts of 4,000 glasses to be given out. “I want to be remembered for transparency, good governance and service to the underprivileged after my administration. Other segments of the underprivileged society like the physically challenged, orphans and widows, would be impacted with our programmes too,” he said.
