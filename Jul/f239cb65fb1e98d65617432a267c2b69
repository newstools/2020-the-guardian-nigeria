On what would have been her 40th birthday celebration, the Ibidunni Ighodalo Foundation launched a new initiative in memory of the founder, Ibidunni, who passed away on June 14. Tagged ‘Project 40at40,’ the idea is in accordance with the founder’s last wish. Forty couples, not more than 50 years of age, from the lower economic class with infertility problems across Nigeria and who have been married for five years without any issue are set to benefit from the project, which seeks to reduce infertility in the country. The initiative, conceived by the late Ibidunni, would grant 40 couples in dire need of reproductive intervention an opportunity to become parents through In-Vitro Fertilisation (IVF). Speaking at a press conference to launch the project, chairman of the foundation, Pastor Ituah Ighodalo, said the initiative was conceived by the late Ibidunni to support 40 couples go through IVF procedures and get their babies. He added that the foundation, since inception in 2016, supported about 50 couples in achieving fertility, and has recorded over 12 successes, including a set of twins. Speaking on the source of funding, Ighodalo said about N150 million is needed as each procedure costs about N2 million and sometimes N4 million, depending on the complexity. He appealed to the public to fund the project and ensure its sustainability to reduce the rate of infertility in the country. Chief Medical Director, Roding Reproductive Centre, Dr Adewunmi Adeyemi-Bero, who is a board member of the foundation, said the advent of technologies in medicine has changed the face of infertility globally, with a 25-30 per cent success recorded among couples treated with IVF.
