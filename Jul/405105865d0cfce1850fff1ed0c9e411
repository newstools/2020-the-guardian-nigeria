 House of Representative Committee on Aviation examine activities and readiness of the Nnamdi Azikiwe international airport Abuja.													     PHOTO: PHILIP OJISUA  At least another two airports were yesterday certified ready and opened to commercial flights services after three months of COVID-19 lockdown.The facilities, Margaret Ekpo Airport, Calabar and Yola Airport, Adamawa State, reopened, although amid general traveller apathy since local flight services resumed a fortnight ago.
  
Corporate Affairs General Manager at the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN), Henrietta Yakubu, confirmed the development, and hinted that Kaduna Airport would also join the active aerodromes today.
  
Meanwhile, the Federal Government has insisted on compliance with the standard safety and security protocol, to avoid the closure of recently reopened airports.To date, a total of 10 out of 22 airports have opened for local flights operations, amid very low patronage and operating number of flights.  “Please note that you can wake up tomorrow and find that we have closed Abuja, if we have a need to do so. It is not any consideration of geographical spread or federal character.” He added that some of the airports are not yet ready for inspection. But when ready, they would go there for certification.
  
“We will inspect Katsina and Kebbi soon. Benin, Akure, Ilorin, and Ibadan are not ready for the inspection according to the airport managers. From July 20, we will get into these airports to ensure we do the needful and also open them.
  
“Makurdi is scheduled for inspection. We will try to pair it with Jos. Some of those we are awaiting to send in their plans for restart are not airports owned by the FG. They are like Bauchi, Gombe, Asaba, and Escravos. However, Dutse, and Osubi are FG owned. We will wait until they tell us that they are ready,” Sirika said.
