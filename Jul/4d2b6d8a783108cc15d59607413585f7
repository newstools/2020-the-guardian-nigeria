Hundreds of Muslims settled for last-minute purchases of rams and food items in the Ota area of Ogun state to celebrate the annual Eid Al-Kabir on Friday. Some of the Muslim faithfuls, who spoke with The Guardian at Goro livestock and Ijako food markets, said their decision was hinged on taking advantage of discounts from the purchase of ram, goat, cows, tomato, rice and other food items. Yusuf Ibidapo, a judicial worker blamed the coronavirus pandemic for the hike in food prices, especially during the Eid Al-Kabir celebration. Ibidapo said, “The pandemic has forced things to take backward steps, regardless, Muslims are doing their best to have a fulfilling and memorable celebration. “Most of the people at this market came with the mindset that they would get rams and goats at lower prices today being Eid al-Adha.” A trader at the Goro livestock market Lukman Afolabi commended Muslims for celebrating the festival of sacrifice in the best possible way, noting that “we witnessed a significant rise in the number of persons that have been at the market in the last five days.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
