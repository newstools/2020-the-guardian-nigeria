 shows Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro gesturing while having his hydroxychloroquine dose, after having tested positive for COVID-19. – The 65-year-old head of state shrugged off his diagnosis insisting that “life goes on” in the face of what he for months has been calling a “little flu” — otherwise known as the global COVID-19 pandemic that has claimed the lives of 65,000 Brazilians and counting (Jair Bolsonaro in Facebook/AFP/Stringer)  Bolsonaro, 65, appeared in his weekly Facebook Live post at his official residence. He appeared to be in good shape and was not accompanied, as is often the case, by ministers or senior officials, and the usual sign language interpreter was not present. Since the beginning of the crisis, the far-right president has dismissed the seriousness of the epidemic and criticized containment measures ordered by governors in Brazilian states. Bolsonaro said that after feeling unwell at the end of last week, he had started taking one hydroxychloroquine tablet every day. The drug, originally tested to fight malaria, has been pushed as a treatment for COVID-19 in many countries — but its effectiveness has not been formally proven and the issue is deeply dividing the global scientific community. “I’m saying this very clearly,” Bolsonaro said in his video. “I took (hydroxychloroquine) and it worked, and I’m fine, thank God. And let those who criticize it at least offer an alternative.” He did, however, deny making “propaganda for hydroxychloroquine”. Brazil is currently the second country hardest-hit country in the world by the pandemic, behind the United States. The death toll on Thursday was 69,184, with an increase of 1,224 in the previous 24 hours. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
