US President Donald Trump and Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan agreed to work “more closely” for a solution to the Libya conflict during a phone call on Tuesday, the Turkish presidency said. Erdogan and the US president “agreed to cooperate more closely, as allies, … to promote lasting stability in Libya,” it said.
