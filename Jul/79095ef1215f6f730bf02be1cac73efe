The Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) reopened bearish yesterday, occasioned by losses in most blue-chip stocks, especially Neimeth International, and Cutix as market capitalisation lost N10 billion.
 
At the close of transactions Monday, the All-Share Index (ASI) also slipped by 18.08 absolute points or 0.07 per cent to close at 24,269.58 points. Similarly, the overall market capitalisation shed N10 billion to close at N12.660 trillion.
 
The downturn was impacted by losses recorded in large and medium capital stocks, including Cutix, Neimeth International Pharmaceuticals, Zenith Bank, Ecobank Transnational Incorporated (ETI), and Access Bank.
 
Analysts at Vetiva Capital said: “With the absence of any positive event capable of lifting investors’ sentiment, coupled with the lack of significant positive movement in large cap stocks, the domestic bourse extended last week’s bearish performance into today’s session.
 
“However, with the persistent declines we’ve seen across board in recent times (especially in the Banking sector), we expect to see positive investors’ patronage in the coming sessions, driven by cheap valuations of a number of fundamentally justified stocks.”
 
Market breadth was slightly negative, with 12 gainers versus 13 losers. GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Nigeria recorded the highest price gain of 9.47 per cent to close at N5.20 per share.
