Residents said the quake hit shortly after midday and was felt in towns and cities across a wide swathe of the rugged country. But the PNG Disaster Centre said it had received no reports of casualties or significant damage several hours after the quake, although assessment teams were still en route to some of the most remote areas. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre briefly issued a warning of potentially hazardous waves in nearby coastal areas, but later cancelled the alert. PNG sits on the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire, which is a hotspot for seismic activity due to friction between tectonic plates. A 7.5-magnitude quake that hit the rugged highlands region in February 2018 triggered landslides, burying homes and killing at least 125 people.
