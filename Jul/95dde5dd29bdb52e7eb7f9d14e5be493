The acting managing director of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), Daniel Pondei slumped while the House of Representatives members probing the misuse of N81 billion interrogated him on Monday. He was however revived after some NDDC officials came to his rescue. Pondei was however ferried out of the venue of the investigative hearing chaired by the chairman of the House Committee on Niger Delta, Olubunmi Tunji-Ojo at about 1:00 pm. Some members of the committee, who felt Pondeiâ€™s action must have been stage-managed, failed in their bid to stop sympathisers from taking Pondei away for medical attention. Pondei was being grilled over alleged extra-budgetary expenditure incurred while he was on the saddle between February to date. The development forced the lawmakers to adjourn the probing session abruptly for 15 minutes to enable them to determine whether to continue the probe.
