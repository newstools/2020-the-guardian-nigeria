Pingjian, who has been around since September 2016, described his tour of duty as a “highly rewarding time.” “I have been privileged to visit all the 36 states of the federation. I have seen the remarkable progress being made under your leadership. I am confident that Nigeria will fly higher,” he said. The Chinese added that in the nearly 50 years of Nigeria-China relations, “this is the best time we have had. You have visited China twice, showed us solidarity at critical times, particularly when the COVID-19 broke out, and you always personally attend the commissioning of projects Nigeria does in alliance with China.” The diplomat said the One China Policy was dear to his home country, lauding the most populous black nation for its support. “To keep China one is a task that must be done. We will appreciate your continued support, and I will remain a goodwill ambassador of Nigeria,” Pingjian stated.
