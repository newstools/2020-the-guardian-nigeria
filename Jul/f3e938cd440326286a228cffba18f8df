The Rotary International District 9110 has commenced a free screening for prostate cancer, with 1,000 men to benefit from the gesture. This was announced by the District Governor, Bola Oyebade, to kick-start the 2020-2021 Rotary Year, which began on July 1. He said most men do shy away from getting screened for the disease because of the cost. It was gathered each screening cost about N25,000. Oyebade said: “We want to see healthier people around. We want everybody to be healthy and we do not have any delight in seeing people die of sicknesses that could be prevented. Hence, we are committed to the humanitarian services of seeing our men, who are breadwinners, stay healthy and live long to become grandfathers and great-grandfathers,” he said. Chairman of the screening committee, Sola Benson, said adequate provision had been made to screen no fewer than 1,000 men between July and September.
The guest speaker, Dr Olanrewaju Afolabi Soyinka, admonished men from aged 40 upwards to be aware of the symptoms of prostate cancer like frequent and uncontrollable urination, while they should avoid red meat, take lots of vegetables and endeavour to have sufficient exercise.
