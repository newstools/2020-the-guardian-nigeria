This means that in some instances, cases could be allocated to the wrong sub-districts. We are working with the sub-districts to clean and verify the data and where errors are picked up locally, cases will be re-allocated to the correct areas.

We send our condolences to their loved ones at this time. Donation from the Chinese Consul General: Today, I received a donation of personal protective equipment (PPE) from the Chinese consul General, Mr Lin Jing. The donation consists of:
30,000 surgical masks;
5000 N95 masks;
500 isolation gowns and​ 500 face shields. This donation will help to bolster our available stocks of PPE, ensuring that we have even more supply for the healthcare workers who are fighting COVID-19 on our frontlines. We thank the Chinese Consulate, and the Chinese government for partnering with us in our fight against COVID-19 and for their ongoing relationship with the Western Cape. Masks for the elderly: The Department of Social Development has distributed 105 000 donated masks to various old aged homes in the province. The Department has so far been able to distribute a total of 120 000 masks to homes in the province. The donations have supplemented the extra support given by the Department of Social Development to facilities, to assist in the fight against COVID-19. We thank the many generous donors who have made these donations to the Western Cape Government and the Department of Social Development, which has allowed us to provide additional protection to this high risk group. Fake news: A number of new fake news messages are once again circulating on social media networks, which are designed to spread fear and confusion among members of the public and parents of children returning to school. COVID-19 is a serious pandemic which should be treated as such, however, using false information that creates panic, or which is designed to take advantage of vulnerable citizens, is irresponsible and does not help in the fight against this virus. Information coming from unknown or unnamed sources should be carefully checked and verified before sending it on. Use official government channels, such as the Western Cape, and the South African Government websites and social media channels, and trusted news websites for information. You can also report fake news by Whatsapping it to 067 966 4015. Issued by: Western Cape Office of the Premier Distributed by APO Group on behalf of South African Government.
