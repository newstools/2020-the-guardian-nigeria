The Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) operators in Nigeria are set for a capacity lift, as Tier 11 lender, Polaris Bank, has partnered with global social media giant, Facebook, to provide free digital marketing training for them
 
The move is geared towards equipping SMEs, who are focused on leveraging social media tools to drive businesses and sales.
 
Speaking on the partnership, Group Head, Products & Market Development, Polaris Bank, Adebimpe Ihekuna, was quoted in a statement as saying it is part of the Bank’s non-financial offerings to SMEs, as they strive to scale to the next level.
 
She said as an enterprise positioned to meet the challenges of the digital age, especially during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the Bank is committed to assisting SMEs to ensure they remain relevant in their line of business. She said the 5-day virtual training, which was scheduled to start next month will comprise a maximum of two modules daily, at different time intervals, while a repeat session will hold the following week for SMEs, who were not accommodated in the first week. She said participants, among other things, would learn how to find new customers and build business communities using digital tools. “Participants would also be exposed to strategies to grow their business internationally, build an online business presence with Facebook, use WhatsApp to grow their business, learn how to create Facebook Ads, and scale advertising with Ads Manager and unearth tools to drive their business,” Ihekuna was quoted. Recall that the Bank in conjunction with Digivate 360 ran a similar training across eight locations: Lagos, Enugu, Abuja, Kano, Ilorin, Port Harcourt, Abeokuta and Benin in October 2019 through which 723 SMEs were trained.
