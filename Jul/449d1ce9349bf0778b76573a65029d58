Nigeria, Botswana and Seychelles are likely to reach the United Nations Broadband Commission’s target of affordable broadband services of less than 2% of Gross National Income (GNI) per capita by 2023. This is according to a new report by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), Measuring Digital Development: ICT Price Trends 2019, which claims that broadband prices in the three countries currently account for between 2 and 3% of the GNI per capita. The report says in many African countries, voice packages cost 4.5% of average income, falling short of the global average by 2.5%, while mobile internet users pay 11.5% of GNI or almost three times more than users in other regions who pay 4.3%. According to the report, in Africa, the most affordable broadband prices are so far only available in Gabon and Mauritius which have managed to position prices below the Broadband Commission’s 2% target. The Commission defines internet as being affordable when 1.5 Gigabyte of mobile data is priced at not more than 2% of average monthly income. The research suggests that despite the steady reduction in mobile data prices globally and limited incomes, prices in Africa remain out of reach for a large part of the population, costing more than 10% of GNI per capita. Doreen Bogdan-Martin, director, Telecommunications Development Bureau at ITU, said: “The COVID-19 global health emergency has made us all acutely aware of the vital importance of broadband networks to social and economic prosperity and global development and I hope this authoritative report serves as a pillar of renewed effort to urgently make digital services more available and affordable to all people of the world.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
