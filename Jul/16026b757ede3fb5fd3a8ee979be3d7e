Worried by the effects of COVID-19 on economies within the continent, analysts and auditing firms have stressed the need for Nigeria to be self-sufficient by ensuring fiscal sustainability to achieve the gains of the African Continental Free Trade Area Agreement (AfCFTA).
    
Indeed, COVID-19 has shown that self-sustenance matters, and is important mostly for food security, education, healthcare and logistical services. One of the objectives of the AfCFTA is to make Africa self-reliant in these sectors, while signatories to the agreement need to develop a framework and set realistic implementation plans to improve on them irrespective of regional integration.    
 
PricewaterhouseCoopers Limited (Pwc Nigeria), in its latest report titled, “COVID-19 and the African Continental Free Trade Area Agreement,” said rather than closing borders that can send a negative signal to the progress of the agreement, governments can reduce human flows while keeping the borders open to key goods and services required for national development and economic sustainability.  The report believes the AfCFTA will be competitive, where countries like Egypt with three active digital strategies – (National E-Commerce Strategy, Strategy for Social Responsibility in ICT, and Digital Arabic Content Strategy), would have an edge over others in the market with weak or no digital framework to support trade in goods and service within the continent.
 
Going into the AfCFTA post-COVID-19, Nigeria and other African economies requires building a digital economy to foster production of higher quality goods and services at reduced cost. This will open new channels for value addition and broader structural change.
  
To sustain this process, the report said there is a need to develop and/or upgrade the digital infrastructure, digital financial services, digital entrepreneurship, and digital skills that are thematic pillars of the Digital Economy for Africa (DE4A)15 to encourage trading digitally across individuals, SMEs and governments.
