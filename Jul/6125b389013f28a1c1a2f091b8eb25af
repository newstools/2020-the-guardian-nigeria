The Nigeria Rugby Football Federation.(NRFF) will partner with United Kingdom’s Rugby Outreach to provide fitness, strength and conditioning advice to rugby clubs across the Federation, the federation has revealed. NRFF Technical Director, Abubakar Yaro said at the weekend that the partnership would help domestic teams improve on their fitness and conditioning as required by the game. He described the Rugby Outreach Project as a global charity that provides Rugby fitness, strength and conditioning advice to players. The project, he added, operates on every rugby playing continent to help teams grow from the grassroots level to international standard, including Union, League and Sevens rugby. The NRFF noted that teams interested in the programme could receive free training schedules on areas such as speed, power development, strength and endurance. Yaro said the programmes are tailored to the requirements and needs of the team in question, regardless of location, adding that availability of equipment or kit can also increase players’ physical development.
