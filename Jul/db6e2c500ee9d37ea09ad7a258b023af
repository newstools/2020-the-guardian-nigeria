Harsh conditions for global trade are exacerbated by the tightening of the export credit insurance market – leaving many member country businesses highly exposed. Now more than ever, international partners must come together in solidarity to support countries as they face this once in a generation crisis. It is essential for ICIEC to provide support in stabilizing the trade ecosystem while also planning for recovery across our 47 member countries. The Corporation is playing a critical role in recovery by addressing market gaps and targeting immediate needs for priority sectors such as pharmaceuticals, healthcare supplies and agricultural commodities”. “The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted most OIC member countries on the economic, financial, and social fronts, some more severe than others. In a bid to extend support, shore up demand, and protect people’s jobs and livelihood, ICD has set up a dedicated US$ 250 million respond package to aid SMEs and the private sector in affected countries. The emergency funding would be mainly in the form of medium to long-term financing instruments to alleviate the economic burden faced by existing and new clients.” stated Mr. Ayman Sejiny, the CEO of the Islamic Corporation for the Development of the Private Sector (ICD), and one of the keynote speakers in the webinar. Eng. Hani Salem Sonbol, the Chief Executive Officer of the International Islamic Trade Finance Corporation (ITFC) and one of the keynote speakers in the webinar, stated: “ITFC is moving forward with its plans to continue supporting member countries in the recovery phase, including the provision of lines of financing to support the private sector and SMEs. In the recovery phase, ITFC will drive integrated trade solutions that will combine financing with capacity building and flagship programs to promote regional cooperation and enhance intra-OIC trade. It is with trade as the engine of economic growth, and close collaboration with partners, ITFC will focus on what makes the best impact on the livelihoods in the near-term and long-term and provide quality of life for the hundreds of millions of people most affected by the pandemic.” This initiative tied with Annual Investment Meeting will abet in an upsurge in Foreign Direct Investment growth whilst stimulating trade and investment opportunities in targeted countries. Affected OIC Member Countries’ economies will be supported during this challenging period by seeking a pool of potential partners to finance trade and infrastructure projects that will lead to a rise in job creation and an increase in Gross Domestic Product. In addition, this will support the SMEs to thrive and improve the country’s export. Post the COVID-19 period, it will be evident that markets are recovering gradually. Consequently the IsDB Initiative will cater to supporting developing countries and economies at that time by generating business growth and co-financing investment and trade prospects in member countries. They also strive to invigorate the cross border investments. Distributed by APO Group on behalf of Islamic Development Bank Group (IsDB Group). About Islamic Development Bank (IsDB):
