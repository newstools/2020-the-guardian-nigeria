Africans have been charged to enhance their working concept by developing the mindset of futuristic to avoid job takeover by robots in the future. The charge was made during the Fix-it-conference, a pan-African virtual conference that took place recently. The keynote speaker, Kwame Opoku, who extensively discussed the concept of technology as the future, said: “The world is gradually moving into the era of robotics and to secure jobs and businesses, everyone needs to key into futuristic technology to avoid losing to robotics.” The all-encompassing conference, which was organised by The Ark Coaching Company, had local and international participants from all walks of life treated to series of business transformational coaching sessions by professionals in different fields.
