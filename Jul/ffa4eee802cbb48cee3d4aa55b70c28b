The Ekiti State government has backtracked from its earlier decision to reopen worship centres yesterday, shifting the date to August 14.In a statement by the Commissioner for Health, Dr. Mojisola Yaya-Kolade, the government said the action was taken in view of the unpreparedness of the leaders of churches and mosques to comply with conditions stipulated for reopening of the religious centres. “The latest communiqué of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) is indicative of the fact that worship centres are not yet ready to comply with conditions stipulated by the government for reopening of worship centres. “In view of the foregoing, the state government has shifted the date for the reopening of worship centres to August 14, 2020, to give the worship centres enough time to meet the prescribed conditions,” he said. The Commissioner said in as much as fumigation of religious centres remains a prerequisite for reopening, such should not be done in contravention of the Ekiti State Environmental Health and Sanitation Law. She stated that those within the ages of one to 12 and 65 and above were exempted from attending any congregational programme in any religious centre because of their vulnerability.
