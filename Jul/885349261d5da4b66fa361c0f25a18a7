She added that a police sergeant guarding the foreigners was shot dead by the attackers and that officers were searching for the kidnappers. The police could not immediately say the motive for the abduction. Local community leader Dominic Akpan said there were six attackers armed with Kalashnikov rifles. “They shot into the air while one aimed at the police, killed him and collected his gun before going for the Chinese (workers),” he told AFP. Victims of kidnappings are often released unhurt after ransom payments. Police rarely confirm such payments. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
