The suspended acting chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Ibrahim Magu, has applied to the Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, to be released on bail. Magu, who is facing a probe panel set up by President Muhammadu over allegations of corruption and insubordination, requested to be granted bail through a letter sent on his behalf by one of his lawyers, Oluwatosin Ojaomo, Friday in Abuja. His lawyer’s letter dated July 10 with the IGP office’s acknowledgement stamp bearing the same date, and obtained, requested the embattled acting EFCC chairman be granted bail “on self-recognisance”. Magu, who has been in detention since his arrest on Monday has been appearing before the panel from the Force Criminal Investigation Department (FCID), Abuja. The suspended acting boss of the anti-corruption agency spent his fourth night in detention on Thursday. Unlike Magu, every other person who has appeared before the panel has been allowed to go home after the appearance.
