A few days after losing in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship election primary in Ondo State, the Deputy Governor, Agboola Ajayi, might be on his way to joining the Zenith Labour Party (ZLP) for the party’s ticket. This was a sequel to the deputy governor’s meeting with the state’s immediate past governor, Dr. Olusegun Mimiko, who is also a kinsman, at his residence in Ondo City, on Friday. The Guardian learnt the meeting occurred shortly after the winner of the PDP primary election, Eyitayo Jegede, visited Ajayi, as part of his reconciliation moves. It would be recalled that Ajayi dumped the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) 30 days to PDP’s governorship primary, but came second with 657 votes. Meanwhile, ZLP had elected Rotimi Benjamin, as its candidate for the October 10, 2020 governorship election. Sources, who were privy to the meeting in Ondo, said Mimiko did not give him a definite answer while expressing uncertainty over the effect of such political overtures to Benjamin. However, the Director-General of Agboola Alfred Ajayi Campaign Organisation (3ACO), Dr. Kola Ademujimi, said: “PDP remains our party. We want all our supporters to remain loyal to the party, as we work towards the way forward.” Also, the Media Adviser to the Deputy Governor, Mr. Allen Sowore, said: “Ajayi is a bonafide member of the PDP.” He revealed that his boss was at the flag-off campaign of Edo State governor, Godwin Obaseki. Sowore, who earlier issued a statement to accept the result of the primary and urged their followers to support PDP, affirmed that the party’s candidate, Jegede, met with the deputy governor for post-primary reconciliation. Similarly, the Chief Press Secretary to the Deputy Governor, Mr. Babatope Okeowo, said: “It is the handiwork of the state government to portray him as a desperate person.
