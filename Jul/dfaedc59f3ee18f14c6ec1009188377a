One of Spain’s best-supported clubs with more than 50,000 season ticket holders, Betis are currently 14th in La Liga, nine points above the relegation zone. A report in newspaper Marca said the club wishes to wait until they have mathematically guaranteed their status in the top flight before announcing they have hired Pellegrini. Pellegrini won the Premier League title with City in 2014 as well as two League Cups and had successful stays in Spain’s top-flight with Villarreal, who he took to the Champions League semi-finals in 2006. He led Malaga into Europe’s top competition for the first time in 2012 and to the last eight of the competition the following year, losing to eventual finalists Borussia Dortmund.
