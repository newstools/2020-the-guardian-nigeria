  Jhene Aiko, Roddy Rich, And Other Rappers Jump On “Feed Your City” Challenge The Feed Your City Challenge, founded by retired NBA star, Ricky Davis, and music industry legend, Tony Draper, has made the fifth stop on its nationwide campaign to combat the COVID-19 pandemic on Sunday in the parking lot of the Baldwin Hills Mall at 2 pm. Los Angeles natives, Grammy award-winning multi-platinum producer Mustard, platinum-selling singer Jhene Aiko and Grammy award-winning artist Roddy Ricch, alongside local city leaders, served the community fresh groceries and PPE items until supplies ran out. Feed Your City Challenge has provided fresh groceries and essential PPE supplies for up to 10,000 community members via non-contact drive-thru lanes, following all CDC social distancing guidelines. The organization has produced community-driven events in cities across the country and served tens of thousands of people impacted by the coronavirus. Los Angeles will join the growing list of cities receiving support in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Feed Your City Challenge is meant to feed those in need and challenge more cities to join. Previous events around the country included Norfolk, VA with recording artist Pusha T; Petersburg VA with recording artist Trey Songz; Brooklyn, New York with music executive Steven Victor in honor of Pop-Smoke; and Oakland, CA with Grammy award-winning and Oscar-nominated, producer/singer/songwriter Raphael Saadiq. Challenge is focused on providing underserved and underprivileged community members with healthy fresh groceries, meat, and essential PPE supplies.
