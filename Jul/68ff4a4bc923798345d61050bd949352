Group seeks stiffer penalty for corrupt persons The first Military Administrator of Delta State, Air Commodore Luke Ochulor (rtd.), yesterday, said those working under President Muhammadu Buhari were responsible for increased corruption in the country. He said as the President was prosecuting the corruption war, his success would depend largely on the collective support and efforts from those he had engaged to help him curb the socio-economic menace. Ochulor, who stated this in an interview with The Guardian in Owerri, urged Nigerians to see reasons with Buhari over the situation, saying, “As an individual, he does not have the capacity to fight corruption alone. “Buhari can not act outside the reports he receives on the issue. It is the responsibility of his aides to brief him properly on the true position of things.” Meanwhile, the Savannah Centre for Diplomacy, Democracy and Development (SCDDD), has urged the President to ensure that all those indicted for corrupt practices were made to face the law, no matter how highly placed. Executive Director of the group, Amb. Sani Bala, stated this at a one-day town hall engagement with stakeholders on Leadership Effectiveness and Accountability in Governance in Owerri yesterday. He said the rate of corruption in the country has become a huge embarrassment and source of worry to concerned citizens. “Regrettably, good governance and effective leadership have continued to remain critical challenges in Africa and Nigeria, as they have hampered development. It is important that citizens constantly demand absolute necessity from their leaders through constructive dialogue, transparent actions and conducts,” Bala said.
