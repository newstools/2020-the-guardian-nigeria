Another shows her in a ruffled bottom, white knee-high stockings and a blue done-up hairstyle, complete with a bright-green bow, the PEOPLE reports. “Love. Marriage. Baby carriage. Overflowing with excitement & gratitude. Thank you all for the well wishes.” This is coming nine months after Minaj and Petty tied the knot after less than one year of dating. A month before the wedding, she shocked her fans with a surprise retirement announcement, stating that she wanted to start a family. “I’ve decided to retire & have my family. I know you guys are happy now. To my fans, keep reppin me, do it til da death of me … Love you for LIFE,” she wrote on Twitter. During an episode of Queen Radio in June, the “Megatron” rapper said that she and Petty had already received their marriage license. “We did get our marriage license. I think I have what I was striving for, just happiness. It was so hard to get to a happy place. Now that I’m there I don’t want to compromise that for anyone of anything. Certain travelling things I don’t wanna do it. I’m just enjoying my downtime.”
