Benjamin Keough And Family Elvis Presley’s only grandson died on Sunday, his mother Lisa Marie Presley’s manager has confirmed. Benjamin Keough was 27, however, manager Roger Widynowski gave no further details about his death. He said Lisa Marie, 52, was “heartbroken, inconsolable, and beyond devastated. She adored that boy. He was the love of her life.” She is trying to stay strong for her other daughters. The Los Angeles County coroner’s office confirmed that the death of a person of his name and age was under investigation, but there was no other immediate information on the circumstances. He was the younger of the two children Lisa Marie Presley had with her first husband, musician Danny Keough, before their divorce in 1994. The other is actress Riley Keough, 31. Lisa Marie had previously described Keough’s resemblance to her famous father as “just uncanny.” Rock ‘n’ roll legend Elvis Presley died in 1977 aged 42. Lisa Marie also has twin 11-year-old daughters with her fourth husband, musician, and producer Michael Lockwood, who she wed in 2006 after brief marriages to pop star Michael Jackson and actor Nicolas Cage. Her close relationship with her son, whose middle name was Storm, apparently inspired the title track on her third album, Storm & Grace, released in 2012. Lisa often dedicates songs to her children. In the song, she sings about Benjamin, who was 19 at the time, growing too fast. Stop moving so fast there, and then take your foot off the gas. My heart can’t seem to take it, your storm and your grace. She accompanied the song with a beautiful music video featuring family photos. Benjamin is the younger brother of Riley Keough, 31, who recently starred in the indie horror film The Lodge. She also appeared in romance/mystery Earthquake Bird, and TV series The Girlfriend Experience. Riley married Ben Smith-Petersen in 2015. Benjamin also has twin half-siblings Finley and Harper, 11, through his mom.
