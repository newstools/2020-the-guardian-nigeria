In response to the increase in reported cases of sexual harassment in tertiary institutions, the Nigerian Senate has passed a bill to protect students from sexual predators. Titled “A Bill for an Act to Prevent, Prohibit and Redress Sexual Harassment of Students in Tertiary Educational Institutions and for Matters concerned therewith 2020,” the bill has passed a third reading and has been sent to the House of Representatives for their input. Upon its return from the House, and after a concurrence report, it will be sent to the President for assent. If passed into law, the bill prescribes a 14-year jail term for anyone caught intimidating a student for sex or any lecturer who enters a mutually agreed relationship with any student. Indeed, the bill criminalises any form of sexual or close relationship between lecturers and students. 
 
The spirit behind the bill ought to draw attention to the plight of female or vulnerable students who have suffered sexual exploitation in the hands of randy lecturers. To that extent, the concern of the National Assembly is in order. The devil is in the details and the selective attention given to tertiary institutions. Although, we agree that sexual harassment is a public health problem that is often dealt with in the closet by most institutions.
