Oyo State Governor Seyi Makinde has proposed an N3 billion-investment plan for water supply to make the commodity available at major cities and rural areas. Chairman, Oyo State Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Agency (RUWASSA), Najeem Omirinde, who disclosed this while answering questions on a radio programme in Ibadan, yesterday, said that out of the N3 billion water investment plan, N500 million was dedicated to repairing faulty public boreholes throughout the state to ease people of the burden of contributing money towards such purpose. Omirinde added that he had contacted chairmen of all local councils and their Local Council Development Areas (LCDAs) to submit a list of 10 faulty boreholes in each community. He said: “Oyo RUWASSA has already contacted the chairmen of all the local councils in the state to make a list of 10 faulty boreholes in their areas for repair to reduce the number of boreholes to be dug and be environmental-friendly and as well cut cost. “The governor has assured the people of the state of his readiness to make water available, both from the surface (dam) and from the deep ground to ease the burden of our people’s quest for water. “Governor Makinde has set aside an N3 billion water investment plan for an immediate solution for water problem in Oyo State and from this, the sum of N500 million will be used for repair of faulty boreholes in all public areas.” Najeem said that the governor had directed that every new borehole dug in public areas must be solar-powered so as to ensure durability of the project. He, however, urged the public to write the agency whenever they want to request for digging of a borehole for public use or for private homes and businesses.
