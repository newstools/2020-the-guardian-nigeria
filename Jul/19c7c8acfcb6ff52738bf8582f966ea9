Different accusations have been pointed at Frank Amudo since the allegation got out in June. In a released video on Social Media, the ex-manager said Seyitan informed him of the alleged rape incident when it happened. Giving a recap of the incident, he said: Upon my arrival in Accra, Seyitan called, saying that D’banj gained access into her hotel room at Glee Hotel by 3 am and raped her. I was shocked at this allegation because I wondered how D’banj gained access into this room knowing full well that I did not disclose my room number to him and he was not lodged at the hotel. I called Seyitan back to ask why she was given $100 and why she would claim she was raped by D’banj and she angrily replied in a series of voice notes reiterating the accusation and that she was told not to tell me because they assumed she was my girlfriend. She said she had left everything in God’s hands and made it clear that she was not interested in taking the matter to the public. I chose not to discuss this matter with D’banj because he and his wife were also in Accra as this was supposed to be a healing trip to recover from the loss of their son. I thought it was insensitive to discuss such an issue on this trip, as Seyitan had even mentioned that she didn’t want the matter escalated further. He further said he was pushed to say his side of the story because of the constant calls he was getting and allegations stating that he pushed Seyitan to take up the case because he ended his work relationship with Dbanj on a bad note. In his words: Most confounding was that Kemi Olunloyo, who never called me to hear my side of the narration, claimed that I was in the habit of arranging girls for artistes and that I was being ungrateful to D’banj by setting him up in collusion with Seyitan. I find this act of defamation very unscrupulous, malicious, mischievous, and very damaging to my name and brand. My legal team has initiated moves to earnestly seek redress. The last, of course, has not been heard of this. He further complained about the different rigorous questioning sessions he had to go through with the police and hopes things would end soon. I have since gone there and made my statement as requested. I was re-invited again to come in for certain clarifications on some aspects of the investigation, which I have also done. This experience has been very traumatic and demonstrates a sheer show of power, wealth, and influence, considering that I have gone for questioning more than the accused or accuser.
