Organizers of the Africa Safety Award for Excellence (AfriSAFE) have announced a $1,000 prize for the winner of the AfriSAFE Young Innovation award category, which seeks to recognise and reward young people deploying innovative solutions to address the unique challenges presented by COVID-19 in their environments. This was disclosed yesterday by the Chief Coordinator of AfriSAFE, Femi Da-Silva, who stated that it was in line with the body’s bid to support excellence and creativity in the health and safety industry.
 
He said: “The young innovation award will be given to any young person or collaborative effort from across Africa by young persons of not more than 25 years that have created innovative methods to tackle the challenges presented by the novel coronavirus in their domains. Their submissions must be original and not be alterations to patents held by others.”  The award nomination, which is currently ongoing via www.afrisafe.org, will end on August 7, while the award ceremony will be held virtually on October 11, in line with global standards for social distancing and large gatherings.
 
Da-Silva added that the AfriSAFE 2020 would also recognise and celebrate government leaders, employers and top executives that have displayed a verifiable commitment to the health, safety and well-being of staff and the community at large.
