Dbanj and Seyitan Seyitan Babatayo, who accused Nigerian singer Oladapo Oyebanjo better known as D’banj of raping her, has withdrawn her petition against the singer. In the high-profile rape allegation case which has earned reactions from public figures and social media users alike, Seyitan Babatayo accused D’banj of raping her in December, 2018 in Lagos. In a letter dated July 17, 2020 addressed to the Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, through her lawyer, Olamide Omileye, Seyitan said she was withdrawing the case for “personal reasons”. “We hereby officially notify you of our client’s intention to withdraw and discontinue her petition against Mr. Oladapo Daniel Oyebanjo aka D’Banj for personal reasons. “Our client further humbly applies that the investigation and all other action that is currently being carried out by the police with respect to the statement.” Withdrawal of petition by Seyitan’s lawyer Withdrawal of petition by Seyitan’s lawyer The Deputy Commissioner of Police (Admin), Umar Sanda, in his response to the letter, said the investigation was “discontinued as no substantial evidence to prove the allegation of rape against the suspect.” Seyitan also addressed the statement made by humans right organisation, Stand To End Rape (STER) in which it accused human rights activist Segun Awosanya better known as Segalink of perverting justice by arranging for a private settlement between Seyitan and D’banj. In her response which was released on her Twitter page, Seyitan said that it was her and her family that “did resolve to and subsequently contact @segalink to facilitate a meeting with D’banj’s team for a resolution of the issue.” She added that she had called the attention of STER to the part of the statement claiming that “@segalink called me for a meeting with D’banj to resolve the matter, and the view that he condoned or tried to stop a criminal justice course is grossly incorrect.”
