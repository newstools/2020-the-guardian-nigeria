While the wave of support has also landed the ex-pornstar in legal wranglings with industry giant BangBros. Khalifa has repeatedly shared the Change.org petition, titled ‘Justice for Mia Khalifa’, on her popular social media channels and the signatures have come flooding in. The petition says Khalifa was in the porn industry for only three months in 2014 when she was 21-years-old. The petition reads: She was only paid $12k from the millions of dollars that Pornhub and BangBros make off her videos. The infamous hijab video has collected ISIS death threats that have targeted Mia from the video’s release in 2014 to today. Mia attends therapy on a consistent basis for trauma, emotional distress, and the consequences of bullying. In an Instagram post, the ex-porn star posted: The men yelling at me are the same men clicking on me.” But fuck them, because tonight over 1 million people have signed the petition to reclaim my domain name from B*ngBros & stop constant republication of the videos that have haunted me for 6 years. Thank you, guys. I know this is a MOUNTAIN of a fight, but we need change for future girls, and precedent has to start somewhere. However, Bangbros has sent Mia a cease and desist demand via their legal team. On Twitter, they posted: Today we sent @MiaKhalifa a legal C&D [cease and desist] demand which lists some of her defamatory, false statements about BangBros over the years and a list stating the actual facts. We encourage her to share the fact checklist with her audience. We doubt she will though. Mia Khalifa is also known as Mia Callista. She is a Lebanese-American social media personality, sports commentator, and webcam model. She was a pornographic actress from 2014 to 2015.
