This is the first step to looking stylish. A man who is confident in himself and his wears is the archetype of a stylish man. Owning all the designer clothing in the world doesn’t mean much if you don’t exude the confidence that comes with being a stylish man. Ebuka Obi-Uchendu | Image: Instagram/ebuka Make It Fit
This is not the 90s and except you’re doing a stylish retro, do away with oversized items of clothing. The trick is, wearing clothes that fit would solve a great deal of your styling problems. Jamie Foxx | Image: Mark Holmes/styleitholmes Invest In A Suit
You don’t have to work in the corporate world to own a suit. According to GQ, when choosing a suit, opt for one in a solid true navy blue or charcoal grey. Both colours work with every shirt-and-tie combo you can think of. Chance The Rapper | Image: Eric Ray Davidson/GQ Footwear
Your shoes are one of the first items people notice. For formal occasions, an Oxford is preferable, same as a Monk shoe or Derby. Loafers and Chelsea boots are versatile and can give a smart casual look. For a more casual look, go for desert boots, moccasins or boat shoes. Adekunle Gold | Image: Instagram/adekunlegold Jewellery
