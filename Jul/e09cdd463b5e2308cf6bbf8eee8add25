The House of Representatives Committee on Capital Markets and Other Institutions, has expressed commitment to work closely with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), to substantially tackle issues impeding the growth of the local bourse, which can be resolved through the provision of enabling laws.
 
The Chairman of the Committee, Babangida Ibrahim, while speaking during a meeting with the new management of the SEC in Abuja, said: “We have all agreed that there is a need to work together to substantially reduce these challenges. These challenges include policy issues, legislative issues and can also be operational issues.
 
“But what is important is that we have all agreed that there is a need to look inwards to see how best we can boost confidence in the market, and to also make sure that the process of investing in the capital market is as simple as possible.”  Furthermore, he added that the NASS would also review key policy issues that require amendments and adjustments.
   
“We wish to tell investors that they should continue to be patient with us as we work out these issues to boost their confidence. We are aware of their plight, especially their experiences in the recent past, but we will do our best to restore confidence in the market.
   
“We want to assure investors that with the new management we have now at the SEC, we are going to take the capital market to the next level,” he added.
   
The Director General of the SEC, Lamido Yuguda, commended the Committee for its interest in making the capital market transparent and more investor friendly.
   
Yuguda said: “This committee is very important to us at the SEC. We have had very useful discussions with the Chairman, and he has assured the SEC of the co-operation and support of this Committee as we set out to discharge our responsibilities.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
