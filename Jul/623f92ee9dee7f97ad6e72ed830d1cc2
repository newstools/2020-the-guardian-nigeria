The Head of Service, Lagos State, Mr Hakeem Muri-Okunola, has charged post-primary school teachers in the state to collectively review processes and procedures that the pandemic has brought to the fore, such as academic curricular, new ideas and innovations and escalation of sexual abuses of children. He made this remarks as the special guest at the Teaching Service Commission (TESCOM) Eko Educators Webinar Series, where he described teachers as nation builders who are uniquely positioned and lawfully charged with the responsibility of shaping the minds and future of many through all the critical stages of human development, hence, possessing the greatest power of influence. He commended the initiative to represent a truly positive change in the stateâ€™s approach to dealing with emerging issues, particularly in the face of the ravaging COVID-19 pandemic. He added that teachers must continue to improve themselves to meet up with the challenges of the new normal and ensure diligence and continual publicity of all safety rules to prevent the spread of the pandemic. The second series of the Eko Educator Webinar had over 3,000 participants and two guest speakers: Dr Tunji Abimbola (UK), who discussed Vulnerability and Safety: Identification and Support and Mrs Titilola Vivour-Adeniyi, who discussed Abuse and its Consequences on the Child. Chairman, Teaching Service Commission, Mrs Olabisi Ariyo, said with the spate of sexual abuse against children, it had become imperative to train teachers in primary schools on what to look out for as early signs in children suffering from such abuse.
