 Man steals 3-foot dildo | Image: Surveillance footage/TMZ A masked man has made off with a giant dildo from a sex shop in Las Vegas, United States. According to the surveillance footage obtained by TMZ, the masked man calmly strolls in Deja Vu Love Boutique in Las Vegas in broad daylight and grabbed the 3-foot, 40-pound dildo which was standing on the sales floor. The man hoisted the massive dildo on his shoulder and walked out of the store without paying, after which he stuffed it into his car and drove away. A store worker, Laura, who declined to give her last name, told HuffPost that the formidable phallus is named The Moby, presumably in homage to Herman Melville’s classic “Moby-Dick.” “Sadly, the pandemic has encouraged even the scummiest of scumbags to steal the strangest products from innocent businesses,” staffer Ryan Carlson told The New York Post. “This landmark item in our store is worth nearly $2,000, so if you happen to see a 3-foot penis sitting around, please turn in the 6-foot-tall dick who stole it. We can only hope that this thief finds Jesus and returns the item or the law finds him and throws him in prison where he belongs!” The massive phallus is listed on Amazon as the world’s largest retail dildo.
