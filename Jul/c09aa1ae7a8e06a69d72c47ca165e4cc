 IPU members during the donation  The food items were presented to the traditional ruler of the community, Oba Felix Adeniyi Afolabi, by the president of the group, Chief Stephen Omolale, and chairman of Special COVID-19 Palliatives Committee, Deacon Dele Ogunsemoyin. Omolale said IPU, the umbrella body of all indigenes of the community, was affected by the disruption of the sources of livelihood of many in the community due to the debilitating effects of the pandemic. “We felt the only way we could help our people is to come together and do something for them, no matter how small,” he said.	While thanking God that no indigene of the community at home or in the diaspora had fallen victim of Coronavirus, Ogunsemoyin advised citizens to always take all preventive measures to avoid contracting the virus. He also urged the traditional leader and the political class in the community to mount pressure on the state and local governments to provide Iro-Ekiti with all the social amenities befitting its status. Responding, Oba Afolabi thanked IPU for the gesture and prayed for God’s blessings and protection for members of the group at home and in the diaspora. Items donated included bags of rice, beans, Semovita and salt.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
