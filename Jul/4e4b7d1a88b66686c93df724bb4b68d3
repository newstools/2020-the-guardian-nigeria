The Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN) has revealed that it is waiting for response from the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19 to know if it will proceed with its ordinary congress, which was postponed on April 24 due to the severe circumstances caused by the global pandemic. Some state chairmen, delegates and stakeholders in the athletics family were already looking forward to the congress to air their views on the leadership crisis, which has hit the federation, before it was called off. An official of the AFN told The Guardian yesterday that the body had written to the PTF seeking for clearance to enable it hold the congress and plan for the nation’s athletes, some of who are looking forward to their qualification for the Olympics Games. According to the official, the ordinary congress of the AFN would ratify certain decisions taken by the Olamide George-led board at its last meeting in Abuja in January as well as review its constitution. The official added: “It is an opportunity for all the delegates and stakeholders to make their contributions, particularly on issues arising from the removal of the former president Ibrahim Gusau. The congress also has to discuss and approve the training plans for the Olympics Games, which has been moved to 2021.” The Guardian further learnt yesterday that the AFN board had already secured the funds it needs to convey all state chairmen, delegates and other stakeholders to the venue of the congress, which has been scheduled for the Federal Capital Territory Abuja. It was revealed yesterday that the Olamide George-led AFN board has the backing of the Ministry of Youths and Sports Development to hold the congress after it secured a stay of execution order against an Abuja high court ruling, which declared Ibrahim Gusau as the president of the AFN on July 1.
