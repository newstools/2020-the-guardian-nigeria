Vice Chancellor, University of Benin (UNIBEN) Prof Lilian Salami has called on security agencies to step up security efforts in the wake of alarming criminality in the state and country. She also called on the Edo State Police Command to unravel those behind the gruesome murder of a 100 level student of the institution inside a church in Benin City. Speaking during a visit to the Edo State Police Commissioner, CP Johnson Kokumo, the VC solicited Police support in crime prevention and management in the university. Salami, who condemned the gruesome rape and murder of the microbiology student, Miss Uwaila Omozuwa, expressed sadness that the Police was yet to come out with a comprehensive report on the matter. She urged the Police to do all in its power to ensure that no stone is left unturned in their investigation of the crime. CP Johnson Kokumo pledged to work with the institution in securing lives and property, adding that the Police is working tirelessly to bring the culprits to justice, particularly with the arrest of two key suspects. Meanwhile, the Tertiary Education Trust Fund, (TETFUND) has commenced the construction of a 28-executive-room hostel at the university. Salami, who supervised the ground-breaking ceremony, said the proposed edifice is symbolic, as it marks the first of many major projects to be executed during her tenure.
