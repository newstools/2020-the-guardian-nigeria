The Ekefa Olubadan of Ibadan land, Oloye ‘Lekan Alabi has urged young Nigerians to emulate the virtues of integrity, humility, industry and transparency exuded by the late Ibadan-born industrialist, Chief Bode Akindele, so as to excel in their endeavours. Speaking with The Guardian in Ibadan, Alabi who said he had been close to Akindele for 36 years, described him as an enigma, connoisseur, silent philanthropist and pious statesman who contributed to the development of Ibadan, Yoruba land, Nigeria, Africa and the world. Akindele, the Parakoyi of Ibadanland, Baba Ijo, Methodist Church Nigeria, Agbeni, Ibadan and Chairman, MONDANDOLA GROUP, died on June 29 at the age of 87. Alabi said: “He was more than an Ibadan industrialist.   He was a Nigerian and international man.  He is not in the category of a typical businessman.  Chief Bode Akindele’s level is beyond typical businessman. He was into real estate business.  He was into finance.  And he is not limited to Nigeria.  He had factories in Africa, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States of America. He made impacts in industries he played in. He offered employment in thousands. Akindele developed the economies where the companies are located.  …” But he added philanthropy to his own. If an individual could spread his hands to such tentacles, and made a huge success, there is no excuse for government or corporate bodies not to succeed.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
