His tally for the season is 12 goals in all competitions – the Capital One, FA Cup, and friendly games. Also, a brace in the 77th and 90th minutes by Jamie Vardy ensured that the Foxes returned to winning way for the first time at the start of the league after the 3-0 demolition of Palace. Meanwhile, Vardy yesterday scored his 100th and 101st Premier League goals to ignite his club’s hopes of achieving a top-four Premier League finish with the victory. Vardy, who had failed to find the net in three League fixtures, however, led the Foxes’ attack to reap apart the helpless visitor in yesterday’s game. The former English International’s goals make him the 29th player to reach a century of goals in the Premier League and the 16th player to record that for a single club. Vardy has now scored 20 goals this season, making him the highest goal scorer in England’s top-flight football league.
