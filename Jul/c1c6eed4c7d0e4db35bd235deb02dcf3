The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has asked the Nigerian Government to immediately begin the processes of prosecuting the embattled former acting chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Ibrahim Magu. It stated that Magu’s indictment reinforced its position that the much-hyped war against corruption by the EFCC, under Magu’s watch, has been a huge scam by “corrupt individuals to cover the plundering of public resources, harass political opponents, intimidate and extort money from innocent Nigerians.” The party, in a statement by its national publicity secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, Wednesday evening, observed that the revelations of diversion of recovered funds and fraudulent sale of assets seized by the EFCC among other sleazes, as detailed in the memo by the Attorney General and Minister of Justice, as well as the report of the Department of State Services (DSS) on Magu’s activities, have further exposed the racket that the fight against corruption had become under the All Progressives Congress (APC) government. The PDP also said the development has also exposed why corruption has worsened under the Buhari administration, as documented by credible international organisations, including the Transparency International (TI). According to the PDP, “it is a big embarrassment to our nation, that the head of the anti-corruption agency in an administration led by the African Union (AU) anti-corruption champion and which prides itself on zero tolerance for corruption, is being dragged in allegation of looting recovered fund and other  barefaced frauds.” It declared that having exposed the racket, the onus lies on President Muhammadu Buhari to clean his Augean stable by not sweeping the matter under the carpet or seeking to provide soft landing for the indicted EFCC boss and shield him from prosecution. The party pointed out that what Nigerians expect at this moment is for President Buhari to enforce the law by directing relevant agencies to commence actions that would lead to Magu’s prosecution in the court. “Anything short of this will not be acceptable to Nigerians,” the PDP said.
