The Lower Anambra Irrigation project sponsored by the Africa Development Bank (AfDB) under the Agricultural Transformation Agenda support Programme of the Federal Government at Ifite Ogwari, Ayamelum Council Area of the state has received a boost.The project comprises rehabilitation of the pumping station and irrigation channel at Ifite Ogwari awarded to Raycon Construction Company at the cost of N1.8b. It also has the construction of 7.8km and 11.5km roads awarded to Heribron Construction Company and Raycon Construction Company at the cost of N1.2b, as components. Speaking shortly after inspecting the works being carried out on the sites, Commissioner for Agriculture, Nnamdi Onukwuba, who led the Technical Team of the  ministry on the inspection, expressed satisfaction at the pace of work so far accomplished. Onukwuba, however, urged the contractors to expedite action in order to deliver the job on schedule, stressing that the state was benefiting because Governor Willie Obiano paid the state’s counterpart fund, which enabled it to benefit from the programme. He assured that the Ministry of Agriculture would ensure proper monitoring of the projects to achieve its objectives. “This is one of the legacy projects that will guarantee agricultural development and enable Anambra State to achieve its target on rice production,” Onukwuba said. Speaking, Zonal Project Coordinator of ATASP, Romania Egba, explained that the contractors had shown enough commitment since they were awarded the contract.
Egba pointed out that the contractors had achieved 40 per cent completion at some of the sites within a short time. Responding, the site engineers of Heribron and Raycon construction companies, Moses Adelabu and Kayode Olusegun pledged to deliver the project on schedule. They promised to redouble their efforts to cover delays encountered during the lockdown, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. On the inspection team were, Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Agriculture, Mrs. Stephanie Keri Uzo, Special Assistant to the governor, Chief Nwobu, Director of Planning, Ekene Adokwe, and other senior staff members of the ministry.
