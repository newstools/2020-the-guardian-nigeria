Velvet Cakee. Photo Kitchen Lab This past week, I think I lost count on how many times I made red velvet and chocolate cakes for my family. So I thought to share my recipe with you. I use almost the same recipe for both chocolate and red velvet cakes, save for the cocoa powder and red food colouring, every other ingredient is the same, in terms of size and cups. I always get the same result, moist, delicious and yummy cakes. Try out the recipe below, and let me know what you think. Ingredients Classic red velvet. Photo The Kitchn Method
