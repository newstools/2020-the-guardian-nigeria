Justice F.N. Azinge of the Delta State High Court sitting in Otor-Udu has convicted and sentenced the duo of Pastor Glory Okeoghene Aberefa and Reverend Vincent Okpogo to 16 and 10 years of imprisonment respectively. This was contained in a statement yesterday by the spokesperson of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Dele Oyewale.
 
The convicts, alongside their company, Mustard Seed Micro Investment Limited, were prosecuted by the Benin Zonal Office of the EFCC on 16-count charges bordering on conspiracy to steal and stealing, contrary to Section 516 and 390 (9) of the Criminal Code, CAP 21, Vol 1, Laws of Delta State of Nigeria, 2006.  The convicts, who are already serving terms in prison, having been earlier jailed 17 years by both the Federal High Court, Asaba and Delta State High Court, Warri, would serve a new sentence, which Justice Azinge said would take effect after they have completed the extant 17 years of imprisonment.
 
Trouble started for the convicts when under the guise of running a finance company, they defrauded dozens of unsuspecting members of the public of millions of naira, through their fraudulent Mustard Seed Micro Investment Limited.
