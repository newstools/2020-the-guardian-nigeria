•Reiterates readiness to sanitise oil and gas sector
In efforts to address unwholesome practices as well as sanitise the oil and gas sector in the country, the Natural Oil and Gas Suppliers Association of Nigeria (NOGASA), has rolled out the Lagos Zone (South West) operations. The roll-out, took place at the Sagamu Industrial Area Unit, Ogun State, with the inauguration of three industrial unit offices in Sagamu, Ogere, and Mosimi depots. To boost customers’ confidence, the Lagos Zonal Chairman of the Association, Philips Yemi Fatuyi, also unveiled the NOGASA Trustway Bill, and Supplier Trust Receipt, which would be issued at industrial area units to check sharp practices, and promote efficient delivery of products to end users. Fatuyi said: “We formed this association to maintain the integrity of members through flushing out of bad eggs, and making sure there are no irregularities. We are tired of complaints of low quality, scarcity of petroleum products, and stories of diversion of products to neighbouring countries.” He also reiterated NOGASA’s readiness to sanitise the sector by working to ensure and support the government’s effort at stopping pipelines vandalism and promote transparency along the supply value chain. Also speaking, Chairman of NOGASA, Ogun State chapter, Abimbola Okuneye, said with the commencement of operation in the state, the body would work to prevent all forms of products adulteration, and ensure members buy petroleum products from government-approved depots nationwide. He further said the Association would collaborate with various security agencies to stop pipeline vandalism. “As part of our objectives, we shall work against every form of fraud and malpractices in the oil and gas sector. We shall also protect the interest of all our members so as to ensure quality service to the final consumers.” Also present at the occasion was the National President, NOGASA, Benneth Korie, who was represented by his Vice South West Zone, Adebayo Bello, and other state chairmen in the zone comprising, Lagos, Osun, Ekiti, Oyo and Kwara states.
