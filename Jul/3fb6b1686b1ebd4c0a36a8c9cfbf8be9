The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), University of Port Harcourt, has kicked against the alleged secret and fraudulent recruitment of academic and non-academic staff in the university. It also condemned the omission of the university among the recently constituted governing council of some federal universities. ASUU-UNIPORT chairman, Dr Austen A. Sado, said that the union was concerned that the administration of the university had continued to engage in virulent and pervasive violation of procedure in management of the university lately particularly through secret fraudulent recruitment of staff. “The latest is the ongoing recruitment of both academic and non-academic staff, without regard to the rules and procedure for such exercise in the university. To the best of our knowledge, there is no advertisement of vacancies in the university, which ought to be and is the first step of a transparent recruitment process” he said. He said that the union should not be misunderstood as saying that there was no need for additional staff in the university, particularly the academic component, but that the recruitment process must be transparent and fair in addition to observing all the established rules guiding the conditions for staff recruitment, appraisal and promotions in the university. According to him, the present exercise was lacking in all indices of evaluation and appears to be a tactic to hurriedly employ unqualified cronies as a parting gift and to synchronise the personnel register with fraudulent personnel costs.
