While some young Nigerians are lately getting on the wrong side of the law for engaging in internet frauds, the General Manager of Lotto9ja, Mr. Mitchell Okorie, has urged young Nigerians to explore legitimate avenues to earn money through their pastimes instead of engaging in scams. He made this known at the unveiling of Afro hip-hop artiste, Omoniyi Temidayo Zlatan as the brand ambassador of Lotto9ja, an instant online gaming platform. The event, which was held at the Victoria Island, Lagos headquarters of Lotto9ja, had in attendance the Deputy Director of the National Lottery Regulatory Commission (NLRC), Lagos, Mrs. Priscilla Onuzulu, who represented the Director-General, Mr Lanre Gbajabiamila, and other top officials of the commission. Okorie said: “As of December 2019, the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) said there are 126 million internet users in Nigeria. That is about 61.2 per cent of Nigeria’s over 200 million people. Lotto9ja seeks to leverage on this growing but largely mobile population in Nigeria. “The millennials who constitute a huge percentage of the internet users are always on the go and on their mobile devices. As they explore the boundless opportunities that technology offers, they want convenience and privacy. “They want rapid and exciting games that resonate with their personality and deliver instant results. They want games they can call their own and bond with, which is what our platform offers, a premium gaming services to Nigeria’s growing online population.” Zlatan said he was very proud to be identified with the brand because of the opportunity it offers young people to better their lives.
