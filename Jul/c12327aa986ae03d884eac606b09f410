An appeal has gone to the Federal and State governments, to declare war on congestion of prisons, especially with the ravaging coronavirus pandemic.
  
The Hospital and Prison Welfare Initiative (HPWI), which made the call yesterday, through a statement, called on President Muhammadu Buhari to immediately order the release of minors under the age of 18 years from all federal prisons in the country.
 
They also called on governors to follow suit by releasing all vulnerable people who have not committed any capital offence and are merely awaiting trial.   To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
