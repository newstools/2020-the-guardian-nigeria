The Federal Government has enjoined Ebonyi State Government to provide infrastructure for the proposed Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in the state. The state recently crossed a major hurdle to secure approval for the operation of the free trade zone. The Nigeria Export Processing Zone Authority (NEPZA) on Monday received the Certificate of Occupancy from the governor, David Umahi, who was represented by his deputy, Dr. Kelechi Igwe. Speaking at the occasion, the Managing Director of NEPZA, Prof. Adesoji Adesugba, explained that the authority would work towards ensuring the success of the zone. A statement signed by NEPZA, quoted Adesugba as saying: “Infrastructure is key in a free trade zone because such a facility would not function optimally without a good road network, steady power, water and other basic facilities. “It is with this in mind that I urge Ebonyi State government to ensure a seamless provision of infrastructure for the zone. This world-class infrastructure, when developed, will attract investors, industries to the state.” Responding, Umahi said the state was committed to the success of the project. He added that collaboration between the state, federal government and the private sector is required to attain success.
