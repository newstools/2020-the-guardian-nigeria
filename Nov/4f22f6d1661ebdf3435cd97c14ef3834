Kwara State Governor, Abdulrazak Abdulrahaman, has approved a new minimum wage for Kwara workers and lifted the embargo on annual salary increment, promotions, and conversions. He made this known on his official Twitter page monitored yesterday in Ilorin, saying: “I’m delighted to announce that the implementation of the new minimum wage for Kwara workers will commence on November 1, 2020.” This followed the review of the recommendations of the Government and Labour Committee that was set up to work out the modalities for resolving all workers’ welfare-related issues. “Additionally, we have lifted the ban on annual salary increment, which was last done in 2012. Embargo on promotions and conversions have also been lifted with immediate effect. This is in fulfillment of our administration’s pledge to give workers’ welfare the deserved attention,” he said. The governor commended labour leaders and the state’s workforce over their efforts to deliver better services to the people and for their selflessness, understanding, perseverance, and love for the state. “You are the reasons Kwara still remains strong and outstanding among the states of the federation in spite of the economic storms. We know that Kwara is passing through the valley of economic challenges and we’ve proved that we are stronger than the storm. “I, therefore, appeal to our workers to reciprocate our gesture by ensuring increased productivity and efficient service delivery,” he added.
