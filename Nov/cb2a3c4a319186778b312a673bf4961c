 Director-General of NOTAP, Dr. DanAzumi Mohammed Ibrahim  The Director-General of NOTAP, Dr. DanAzumi Mohammed Ibrahim, gave this hint while hosting the Registrar, Trademark Registry, Shafiu Adamu Yauri.
 
Ibrahim said because the world is moving from resource to knowledge base and that the vibrancy of Research and Development in an economy determines the industrial and technological development of a nation, NOTAP would like to see products being developed by Nigerians.  He stressed that NOTAPs intervention in the area of patent promotion was yielding positive results with the attendant increase in patents secured by researchers through the Office over the years, citing examples of the increase in patents from six in 2015 to 16 in 2016, and from 50 in 2017 to 55 in 2018, and 57 in 2019.
   
The Director-General said with the collective goals of enhancing the development of the nation that both organizations share, available windows for partnership with the Trademark Registry would be fully explored.  The Registrar said the Trademark Registry is the gateway to the market and had decided that a desk officer from NOTAP would be needed at the Registry that will handle every trademark application from the Office efficiently.
  
He advocated a robust relationship between Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) of government to drive processes and complement each other in their activities. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
