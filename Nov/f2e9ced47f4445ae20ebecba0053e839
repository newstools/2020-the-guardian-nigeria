In human form and creative form. I’m so glad I can finally share them with you. I present to you ‘A Better Time’” Davido recorded the album after his tour was canceled due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. “I got back in the studio, and funny enough, I was making better music than I had previously dropped, and we just kept going,” he told Rolling Stone.
