They also urged Buni to dissolve the existing caretaker committee of the party in the state led by Marcon Nlemigbo and accord due to recognition to Nwafor group in the overall interest of the party. Also, in a communique issued after the meeting, the party leaders said: “We enjoin Governor Hope Uzodinma to allow the democratically-elected Executive Council Chairmen and Councillors to go back to their offices peacefully so that they can work in unity to support his APC-led government to deliver the dividends of democracy to our people. “We welcome with delight the recent judgment of the Court of Appeal, Abuja, in reaffirming our legitimacy as the duly elected executives of Imo State APC at all levels. “We pledge to work with all our leaders and members to uplift the party and its fortunes.” It would be recalled that the Court of Appeal, Abuja, had on November 9, 2020, upheld the ruling of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) High Court of August 14, 2018, which recognised the Nwafor-led executives as the legitimate party leadership in the state.
