PHOTO: PHILIP OJISUA  Describing the killing of peaceful protesters at Lekki Tollgate, Lagos State, as an affront on fundamental human rights, the forum called on the government to take necessary action against the perpetrators. Co-chairmen of the group, Bishop Sunday Onuoha, and Alhaji Kunle Ishaq, said that social media had especially been used to make negative utterances capable of inciting violence in the country. Speaking to journalists yesterday in Abuja, the duo called on religious leaders to educate their members on tolerance “because this is fundamental to preventing the escalation of violence.” They urged the youth to be patient and allow the government to address their demands, as violence would not solve the problem. “When people go out and burn Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) vehicles in Lagos, it is not the government that will suffer, but the people. So, youths should not allow themselves to be used as agents of violence,” they advised. On reports that police officers deserted Edo streets, the group called on the police to work with understanding in communities to restore law and order.
