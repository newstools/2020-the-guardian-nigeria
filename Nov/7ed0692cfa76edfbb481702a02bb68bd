In a curious replay of the circumstances leading to Senator Hope Uzodimma’s emergence as the governorship standard-bearer of All Progressives Congress (APC) after former Governor Rochas Okorocha raised obstacles, Senator Ifeanyi Ararume, has defied Governor Uzodimma’s antics to clinch the party’s ticket for Imo North Senatorial By-election. 
   
A Federal High Court sitting in Owerri last Friday ruled that Ararume and not Frank Ibezim or Lady Uchenna Uba, was the rightful candidate qualified to represent APC in the forthcoming by-election. It would be recalled that the seat of Imo North Senatorial District formerly occupied by Senator Benjamin Emeka Uwajumogu, became vacant following the sudden death of the senator in his residence in Abuja last December. 
 
As part of the process of selecting a candidate to fly the party’s flag during the by-election earlier fixed for October 31, 2020, but put forward indefinitely due to the #EndSARS protests, APC organised parallel primaries. 
   
While Ibezim, who was favoured by Governor Uzodimma emerged from the rival primary organised by the Chairman and Secretary of the APC Senatorial Primary Election Primary Committee, Senator Ararume, was announced winner in the alternate primary endorsed by other members of the committee. 
   
Dissatisfied with the outcomes of both exercises, Lady Uchenna Uba approached the Court seeking an order to be declared the authentic candidate of the party for the Senatorial by-election.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
