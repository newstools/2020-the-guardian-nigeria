Sierra Leonean officials may allow fans into the Siaka Stevens Stadium to watch today’s African Cup of Nations qualifier between hosts, Leone Stars, and the Super Eagles. The Confederation of African Football (CAF) last week ruled that fans would only be allowed to watch the qualifying games to the Cameroun 2022 AFCON between November 11 and 17 if the respective countries give the nod. The Guardian learned that the Sierra Leone FA officials are waiting on the country’s leadership to decide on the status of fans, as they believe having supporters in the stadium could lift them to victory over Nigeria. According to Super Eagles’ Media Officer, Femi Raji, the Eagles who had their last work out at the Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium, Benin City, Edo State on Sunday evening, are determined to redeem their image in Freetown after the embarrassing 4-4 scoreline at the weekend. “The Eagles will land in Freetown today (yesterday), after settling down in their hotel rooms, they will proceed to the stadium to have a feel of the pitch which is a normal routine. “The Eagles are in high spirit and all hands are on deck to get the vital points in Sierra Leone,” he said. The Super Eagles held their first training session at the Siaka Stevens Stadium yesterday ahead of game.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
