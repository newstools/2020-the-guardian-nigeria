Ahead of his 2023 political ambition, former Governor of Kano State, Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, has inaugurated a new FM station, NASARA radio 98.5fm, in Kano. Owned by the former senator, the new radio station has commenced test transmission that will last for six weeks before it fully hit the airwaves. Unveiling the new radio house on Thursday, October 22, 2020, Kwankwaso said the radio station was conceptualised to give healthy competition and promote human development through intellectual programing. Kwankwaso assured that the new station would be allowed to operate professionally as ethics of the profession demand, reminding that no amount of pressure will derail the management from executing its vision and mission. Arguing that the media in Nigeria is yet to fulfil its role of promoting healthy competition among oppositions, he was confident that the birth of NASARA radio 98.5fm would bridge the wide gape that exist between the voice and the voiceless. Besides the promotion of various political interests, Kwankwaso disclosed the radio station would focus on the plight of common man at the grassroots. “The success of NASARA remains our model contribution to help the society. The new radio will help promote education in all aspects of human life.
“After over two decades of proliferation of media outfits in the country, the media is yet to fulfil its role in promoting healthy competition among oppositions. NASARA radio is here to give people right to voice and exchange ideals,” Kwankwaso said. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
