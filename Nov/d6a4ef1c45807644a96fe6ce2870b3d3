This year we’ve been through crazy times. Real crazy times. And through it all, we’ve all had to look inwards to find our unique hopes of better times ahead. I found a few. In human form and creative form. I’m so glad I can finally share them with you. I present to you ‘A Better Time’” “A Better Time” is coming a year after his second studio album, “A Good Time”, was released. Davido recorded the album after his tour was cancelled due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. “I got back in the studio, and funny enough, I was making better music than I had previously dropped, and we just kept going,” he told Rolling Stone. “My sophomore album was called A Good Time, so, obviously, A Better Time, it’s a better album. I took my time. Better visuals, better production, everything as a whole package.” Stream “A Better Time” below:
