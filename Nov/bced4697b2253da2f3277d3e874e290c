The All Progressives Congress (APC) has asked the Federal High Court in Lagos to compel the police to probe forgery and perjury claims against Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate in the forthcoming December 5, 2020, Lagos East senatorial bye-election, Babatunde Gbadamosi. The party, in a November 24, 2020 motion ex-parte application filed by its counsel, Mr. Kayode Enitan (SAN), against the first defendant, Inspector-General of Police (IGP), and second defendant, Gbadamosi, sought five reliefs from the court. They include an order granting leave for the APC to apply for the issuance of a writ of mandamus to compel the IGP to discharge its public duty to investigate Gbadamosi for the allegations of forgery, perjury, fraud, and failure to participate in the one-year mandatory National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) programme, among others. The APC supported its application with a November 24, 2020 affidavit sworn to by its Assistant Legal Adviser at its Lagos State office, Abimbola Ladigbolu. Providing the basis for the application, Ladigbolu averred, among others, that she knew for a fact that unless the court intervenes by granting the instant application, the first defendant will not investigate the contents of the petition dated November 11, 2020. “I know for a fact that the grant of the instant application will serve the interest of justice and the respondents will not be prejudiced,” she added. On Monday, the APC prayed the court to disqualify Gbadamosi on the grounds that the WAEC certificate he submitted to INEC revealed that the PDP candidate sat for only five subjects, but details of Gbadamosi’s result obtained from WAEC’s official website revealed that the PDP candidate sat for eight subjects in which he had F9 in Bible Knowledge; F9 in Economics and F9 in Mathematics, among others.
