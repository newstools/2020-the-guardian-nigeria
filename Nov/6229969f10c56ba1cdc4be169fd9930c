WILMINGTON, DELAWARE – NOVEMBER 05: Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden walks out of The Queen theater on November 05, 2020 in Wilmington, Delaware. Biden attended internal meetings with staff as votes are still being counted in his tight race against incumbent U.S. President Donald Trump which remains too close to call.   Drew Angerer/Getty Images/AFP The US Secret Service has increased its protective bubble around Joe Biden as chances increased that he will be the next US president, the Washington Post reported Friday. The Secret Service sent an extra squad of agents to Biden’s campaign headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware as expectations rose that the Democratic candidate would be able to declare victory over President Donald Trump as early as Friday, the Post reported. The Secret Service, an agency under the Department of Homeland Security, is in charge or protecting the White House and senior government officials, visiting high officials, and others. It had already deployed some agents to protect Biden around early July after he triumphed in the Democratic Party’s presidential primaries. As a former vice president, Biden could have requested Secret Service protection before then, but reportedly did not. If Biden becomes president-elect, Secret Service protection is expected to ramp up to a higher level. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
