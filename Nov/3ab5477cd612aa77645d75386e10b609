Presenting the results to the Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu, the Registrar and Chief Executive of NECO, Godswill Obioma, said a total of 70,580 candidates sat for the examination nationwide, out of which 24,416 passed, scoring a minimum of 66. The minister announced that three students got the highest scores: Umeonyiagu Chinua Crucifixio (Anambra State) scored 199, Onwuamanam Udochukwu (Enugu State) scored 198 while Salaam Mariam Aderemilekun, (Lagos State) scored 197. He noted that a total of 16,713 candidates were said to be absent from the examination due to the #ENDSARS protests that rocked the country recently. Adamu further noted that with the Unity Colleges now 110 in number, admission carrying capacity has been shored up to 26,625 for the current academic year. He said 720 slots were added with the establishment of six more federal science and technical colleges across the six geopolitical zones. The minister said: “As has been the tradition for decades, the admission criteria include 60 per cent strictly on merit, 30 per cent based on state’s representation in the unity colleges and the remaining 10 per cent to cover other sundry considerations such as special need candidates, gender, local community, biological children of teachers and old students association. “I have, therefore, directed that within 72 hours of the receipt of the result, principals are to complete both the merit-based (60 per cent) and 30 per cent equality of states admission. MEANWHILE, students have been advised to embrace science subjects in order for them to be employers of labour after graduation, rather than engage in subjects that would make it difficult for them to put food on their tables. The traditional head of Panso community in Sardauna Local Government of Taraba State, Alhaji Ahmed Hassan, gave the advice yesterday in an interview with The Guardian in his palace in Gembu. The monarch, who noted that white-collar jobs are no longer available, said: “The much-desired growth can only be achieved if the youths eschew violence and endeavour to go to schools and study science subjects. Their knowledge in science will help in catapulting the country to the desired height.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
