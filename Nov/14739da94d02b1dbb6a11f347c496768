The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in Jigawa State has explained reasons for sack of its former acting chairman, Alhaji Habibu Sani Sara, saying he was axed over alleged gross misappropriation of the party’s funds when he was in office. The Acting Chairman of the party, Alhaji Mohammed Umar Dikuma, who gave the reasons at a press conference with newsmen in Dutse, yesterday, said the action followed an extensive investigation by a committee set up to probe allegations of fraud levelled against Sara. He claimed that the embattled former chairman was given a fair hearing and the opportunity to defend himself. However, when contacted, the embattled chairman faulted the claims, saying due process was not followed in removing him from office. He said: “They invited me before an investigative panel and merely asked me to explain how certain monies were allegedly misappropriated, which to the best of my knowledge, I sincerely explained.” Sara, who explained that his sack had been premeditated, which was why such allegations were orchestrated to make him a scapegoat by those that don’t want him, said: “After just a few days from the so-called investigations, they called me and told me that I should relinquish my position as acting chairman.” The state acting chairman also said the party had specifically summoned a meeting involving elected and appointed members of the party to discuss ‘specific’ issues affecting the harmony and unity of the party with the sole aim of strengthening relationship among party members. He said contrary to reports from some media, the meeting did not hold at the instance of the governor but was convened by the state APC, adding that the North-Central senator, Alhaji Sabo Nakudu, had tendered his apology for his absence and had sent someone to stand for him.
