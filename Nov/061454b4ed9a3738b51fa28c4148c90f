Association for Public Policy Analysis (APPA), yesterday, in Abuja, raised concern over the poor treatment of electricity consumers in the country, especially rural communities. They stressed that the Nigeria Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) may be adding to the frustration and exploitation of consumers. President of the association, Princewill Okorie disclosed that forum offices set up by the commission to address consumer-related issues, especially in the Southeast region, have become a tool to humiliate consumers. Okorie stated that he had been walked out over two times from the office as the group made attempts to defend the rights of power consumers, who are faced with the high handedness of the distribution companies. The development, according to him, is paving ways for arbitrary billing and exploitation of consumers that NERC failed to educate on their rights. In the face of the increase in tariff in the country, Okorie said: “Our effort in analysing bills given to communities and identifying discrepancies and unlawful fraudulent billing methods, and demanding that NERC Forum Office Owerri address them is provoking members of the NERC Forum Owerri, who are bent on covering up the wrongs of the DisCos.” Okorie said NERC officials in the region lack knowledge of Consumer Protection and Licensee Performance Standards of Electric Power Sector Reform Act 2005.
