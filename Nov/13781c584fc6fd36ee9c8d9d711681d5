Following public outcry, soldiers who were seen in viral videos assaulting some residents of Beere, in Ibadan, Oyo State capital on Sunday, were said to have been arrested and taken to the barracks.
 
This was claimed yesterday on Twitter by the Commissioner for Youths and Sports, Seun Fakorede. Fakorede wrote: “My ears are full with news of the unlawful activities of some soldiers of the Nigerian Army, over the weekend. I have immediately reached out to the Commandant of the Operation Burst and I have been assured that the men involved in this distasteful operation have been arrested and taken to the barracks.
  
“They will be dealt with accordingly. This will not repeat itself again in Oyo State. Please, kindly go about your daily business and activities without fear. Thank you.’’
