Following the wild success of singles, Fem and more recently, So Crazy, featuring Lil Baby, pop singer David Adeleke better known as Davido or Omo Baba Olowo (O.B.O), has released highly anticipated album, A Better Time. The album, which officially dropped at midnight yesterday, November 13, features musical greats from across Africa and America such as Nicki Manaj, Tiwa Savage, Nas, Sho Madjozi, Lil Baby, Mayorkun, and Sauti Sol among others. The 17-tracker, which is expected to break records on a number of regional and international music charts, gives more than just the usual Afrobeats sound. In an interview with New York-based writer and editor of WMagazine, an online platform, Maxine Wally, the 30 billion gang leader said: “I changed my album three times because I’ve been recording too much.” According to him, the theme for A Better Time is a celebration. “One thing about Africans — rich or poor, happy or sad, no matter the situation going on in your culture, you always find time to smile and just be happy. People always like to celebrate. So on this album, there are no downers. It’s just straight bangers and music to make people happy,” he told the New York Times. Davido – A Better Time  “It’s the first African album to ever do that. I have to beat myself,” the pop singer stated. With his status his family and his as Nigeria’s ‘golden boy’, it’s no gainsaying the Skelewu crooner carries a fair amount of responsibility on his back, as his three children and fiancé Chioma Rowland are the constant source of tabloid fodder. “There’s a lot of pressure, and I go through a lot. I handle a lot. It’s good being in competition with yourself, because ain’t nobody in the competition with me. No cap. I have to keep being myself, keep doing it every time. Every time we achieve something, we’re happy, but my team is like, ‘you got to do it again, boy,” he added. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
