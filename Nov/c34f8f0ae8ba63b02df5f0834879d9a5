• Accidents claim 109 lives, injure 450 on Ogun roads in nine months An electricity transformer and shops were razed in a fire explosion on Wednesday night when a diesel-laden tanker crashed near a petrol station in Agulu, Aniocha local government area of Anambra State.
 
According to an eyewitness, the 33,000-litre tanker driver lost control while descending a slope towards Nise/Amawbia road in the area. Spillage from the truck spread to the transformer and the nearby roadside shops, which suddenly went up in flames.
 
Also, 13 persons sustained varying degrees of injury in another road accident at Okija, Ihiala local government area of the state. The accident, which occurred along Ihiala-Onitsha road same day, involved a white Toyota Hiace bus and a Toyota Sienna space bus.  MEANWHILE, the Ogun State Traffic Compliance and Enforcement (TRACE) Corps Commander/Chief Executive, Seni Ogunyemi, has said over 109 deaths and 450 injured persons were recorded within nine months in the state this year.
 
Ogunyemi made this known at the 5th annual TRACE Commanders’ Conference and 15th anniversary lecture held at Valley View Auditorium, Government House, Abeokuta yesterday.
 
He identified major causes of the accident as reckless driving, carelessness, burst tyres and nonchalant attitude of road users, noting that most accidents could be averted if necessary actions are taken.
 
He said if strict actions could be taken to deal with reckless driving in the state, many of the accidents could be averted, noting that strict compliance would now be enforced on road users across the state.
 
“If their vehicles are impounded and within one month, they can’t meet up with the condition for release and the vehicles are auctioned, they will abide by rules guiding the roads,” Ogunyemi said.
 
He noted that the commands were fully equipped with public enlightenment gadgets and sensitisation materials to bring more public participation into the ‘Safety Drive’ through the TRACE Traffic Whistle Blower Initiative.
