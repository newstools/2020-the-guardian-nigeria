Following the massive destruction that followed the #EndSARS protests in Lagos State last month, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance, Solomon Adeola, has renewed calls for the Federal Government to grant the state special status and special grant. Adeola was among the South West senators briefed by Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos on the destruction of public and private properties worth over N1 trillion across the state. He stated that over the years, many attempts had been made in the agitation for a special status for the nation’s economic nerve and former capital, with many federal infrastructures and a huge population of different ethnic groups. According to Adeola, the resources of the state government cannot adequately cater to the population and the pressure on amenities in the megacity with a population of over 20 million. A statement by Adeola, which was circulated by his media adviser, Kayode Odunaro, yesterday, made it clear that “with the magnitude of the destruction of critical infrastructure in Lagos last month, it is inconceivable that Lagos government alone can handle the rebuilding of destroyed property, most of which are for the public good.” He explained that when the Federal Government intervened with N1 billion per state to assist in stemming the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), Lagos should have been favourably treated in view of its status. “Nigerians boarding all the burnt Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) buses are not asked their states of origin when they board,” he stated. While commending Sanwo-Olu for his handling of the crisis within the power and resources available to him, Adeola called for an urgent grant from the Federal Government to help the state in rebuilding and replacing destroyed public facilities.
