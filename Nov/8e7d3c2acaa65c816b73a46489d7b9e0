The Marketing Edge Publication (MEP) has recognised outstanding stakeholders in the Integrated Marketing Communications (IMC) industry in the 7th edition of  Brands and Advertising Awards of Excellence.
 
The Awards, which had become a benchmark for recognising and celebrating talents and milestones in the IMC industry, honoured the Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Lagos State, Gbenga Omotosho, among other individuals, multinational companies and the media.
 
Speaking at the event, Publisher/CEO, MEP, John Ajayi, said the event was organised to recognise distinguished players in Nigeria’s IMC industry, for their contributions to the growth and development of their respective sectors.
He said the firm’s venture into brand journalism business, was a result of the urgent need to expand the frontiers of knowledge in the marketing and advertising industry.  The summit which held virtually, had in attendance industry experts, and thought leaders, cutting across the micro and macro-economic sectors, who shared knowledge and insights that provided stakeholders with the requisite compass to navigate the present competitive business environment.
 
In his remarks, Gbenga Omotosho, commended John Ajayi led Marketing Edge for its vision. He said, “John and I have come a long way in the newsroom when there were no gadgets such as computer, and internet and had to chase reporters for stories to meet the deadline. He has always been a hardworking man.”
