All “critical systems” required for games to take place at Old Trafford were secure, the statement said, adding Saturday’s game against West Bromwich Albion would go ahead as planned. “We are not currently aware of any breach of personal data associated with our fans and customers,” it added. “These type of attacks are becoming more and more common and are something you have to rehearse for,” a spokesman for the club told the PA news agency. United are languishing in 14th in the Premier League table and a fine start to their Champions League campaign took a knock with a 2-1 defeat to Istanbul Basaksehir.
