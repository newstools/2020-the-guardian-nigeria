Commenting on the quality of the matches, which have lite up the city of Abuja in the last one week, a Technical Committee member of the League, Barrister Emma Akhigbe, expressed satisfaction with games played so far, adding that all the teams are giving their best to earn good results. “The league has been interesting, considering that we are just coming out of the lockdown due to the first wave of the COVID 19 pandemic. The technical display of the teams did not show that the players were affected by the lockdown. “I am impressed with the performance of the new teams, if you consider the fact that they are playing in the elite division for the first time. Handball is not only about your ability to play on the court, but it is also about team management, discipline, coaching staff, medical staff and many other elements,” he said, adding that the new teams might not win the title but would gain experience ahead of their future. Akhigbe is optimistic that the league would impact positively on the sport in Nigeria, while appealing to other sport-living firms to partner with the Handball Federation of Nigeria.
