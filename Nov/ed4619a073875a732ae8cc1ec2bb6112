Special Adviser on Works and Infrastructure to Ogun State Governor, Engr. Akeem Adesina; Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun; Minister of Works, Raji Fashola and Special Adviser to the Lagos State Governor, Engr (Mrs) Aramide Adeyooye, during the Town Hall meeting and inspection of the on-going reconstruction of Lagos-Ibadan express road, at Ogere, Ogun State… yesterday The Federal Government is to spend N311 billion on the construction and rehabilitation of the 127.6-kilometre Lagos-Ibadan Expressway. The road awarded to Messrs Julius Berger Nigeria, and RCC Nigeria Ltd, in 2013, was reviewed in 2018 following increasing infrastructural development in the axis. Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola SAN, disclosed this during an inspection tour, and a town hall meeting on the dual carriageway at Ogere, Ogun State. He said the government was determined to deliver the project as scheduled, by May 2022, despite the dwindling financial fortunes of the government. The minister ordered tanker drivers and their owners to move their vehicles off the road to enable contractors complete their works on schedule. He further urged the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) to ensure the enforcement of traffic laws, as pouring of diesel and parking of trucks on completed section of the road constitute traffic offences. On the environmental impact of the work to the surrounding communities, Fashola urged the contractors to ensure that remediation work was done on burrow pits and old roads damaged during the construction to ensure sustainability. He also promised that works will soon resume on the Ikorodu-Sagamu road and Lagos-Otta road as funds for the projects have been captured in the 2021 budget.
