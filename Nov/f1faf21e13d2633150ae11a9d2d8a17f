The Climate Transformation and Energy Remediation Society has urged local councils to embark on aggressive investment in clean and renewable energy projects to boost electricity at the local levels. The president of the association, Smart Amaefula, made the call during a summit on “Mainstreaming Renewable Energy for local Governance” in Abuja. He urged local government authorities to key into renewal energy policy for the purpose of supplying electricity and improving the socio-economic development of residents at the grassroots.
 
According to him, there must be innovative interventions to stimulate debate for local council administrations to initiate frameworks, policies, and strategies for sustainable electricity for their primary public infrastructure. He said: “We see the need to intervene in providing a strong voice on how local authorities, even the states, can do things differently to accelerate industrial development in their localities. In his contribution, Darlington Johnson stressed the need for the government to include councils formulated policy and allow them to play a role in power generation. Johnson explained that the third tier of government has the potential to embark on renewable energy projects, citing FCT, Imo, and Rivers which received N23.4 billion, N39.6 billion, and N41.3 billion respectively, from the federal allocations for five years. He called on local government administrations to make by-laws on the generation of renewable energy to empower markets, clinics, and others in their localities. Contributing, the Director, Environment, Satellite Town Development Department in the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA), Olusegun Olusa argued that area councils chairmen should be involved in renewable energy drive. “Though funds are always scarce at the council level, politicians should provide renewable energy to the people,” he added.
