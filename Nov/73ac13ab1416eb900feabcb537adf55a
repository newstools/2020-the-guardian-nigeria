Adorable Angels, Delta Force, and Safety Shooters, yesterday, recorded wins at the on-going Prudent Energy Handball League, at Package B of the Moshood Abiola National Stadium, Abuja. The Angels demolished Seasiders Babes 42-23 to increase their win to four at the championship, while their fifth match ended 31-31 against the Safety Babes. In the other duel, Defender Babes played 21- 21 against hard-fighting Kada Queens in another fixture in the female category. However, in the male class, Delta Force defeated Borno Spiders 25-22, while Safety Shooters subdued Kada Stars 30-25 in an interesting encounter. Commenting on his team’s performance, Coach Isiaka Attanda said they were in the championship to win the trophy, regardless of the presence of other better-ranked teams, adding that hard work by his players was paying off. “We are taking the matches one after the other and our aim is to win the four remaining games. I am not surprised that the team is doing well because we have been together for a long, and the leadership of Emmanuel Olubiyo, who has been financing the team and making sure the players are okay. “The players need to be given monthly salary just like the Kwara Falcons Basketball Club, or else it would be difficult to keep them in Ilorin, as better-remunerated clubs would lure them. “I am sure if the government starts supporting the team and the players get paid, they would be very committed. We are playing the Desert Queens on Sunday (today), and a victory will take us close to the title,” Attanda stated.
