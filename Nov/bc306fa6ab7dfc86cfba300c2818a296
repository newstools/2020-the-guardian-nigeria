After successfully defending his African light heavyweight title last month, Jude Iloh has expressed his desire to get a short at the world title next year. Speaking at the weekend, Iloh, who is confident of his ability to win more laurels in boxing, expressed his desire to keep forging ahead in the sport he loves and is passionate about. He declared that Nigeria’s boxers have qualities needed to be among the best in the world, adding that they only need opportunities to train with good facilities and more promoters to invest and organise competitions for them. On his successful defence of his African light heavyweight title, Iloh said it was possible because of his commitment and discipline in the boxing ring. “I started my boxing career in Benin before moving to France. My decision to continue boxing, even as a businessman, when I returned to Nigeria, was because of my love for the game. “Success in sports requires much hard work and determination. My career so far has been a success. I have recorded 10 victories with eight of them coming through knockout, while two were by split decisions. “My career goal is to win the world title and also develop the young ones aspiring to be boxers in future. As a philanthropist, through my foundation I have been able to support people in my own little way.” He acknowledged the fact that combining boxing with his business engagements has not been easy, adding, however, “God has given me the ability to create time for training regularly despite my busy schedule.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
