A former Flying Eagles coach, John Obuh, has said that that country’s representatives in the CAF Champions League competition, Enyimba FC of Aba, and Plateau United of Jos, would not face any challenge despite their long absence from active football due to the COVID-19 lockdown when they battle their opponents in their opening games today. Plateau United will host Tanzanian side, Simba SC, while Enyimba will face Rahimo FC in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, in the first leg of the preliminary round. Speaking to The Guardian, yesterday, Obuh noted that the commitment and determination of Nigerian footballers would be the positive force behind the teams’ success in the game. He noted that Enyimba and Plateau, which have not kicked a ball in any competitive game since February this year have been using friendly matches to prepare for the ties, adding that they needed to give their best to prove to the world that Nigerian teams are not pushovers in African football. “Enyimba and Plateau United can pick points in the opening fixtures of the CAF Champions League. My fear is whether the new players in the two teams have got enough time to blend. But if coaches of both sides stick to their old players, it would not affect the teams. Enyimba has been in the CAF championship before and the players know the antics involved. For Plateau United, they need to be 100 per cent confident of going into the game. If Enyimba and Plateau United approach their games with the Nigerian spirit of hard work and determination to succeed against all odds, they would surely secure victory in the encounters,” he said. Meanwhile, Simba FC’s 24-man squad, which arrived in the country a few days ago, would be banking on talented Zambia midfield maestro, Clatous Chama to outshine the Nigerian side.
