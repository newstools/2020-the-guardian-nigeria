• Shorunmu begs Nigerians for continuous support
Super Eagles Coach, Gernot Rohr, says he is satisfied by Nigeria’s goalless draw with Sierra Leone in the reverse fixture of the African Cup of Nations qualifying series in Freetown on Tuesday, saying the two points from the matches will aid his team’s qualification dream. Speaking shortly after the game, Rohr promised a more improved Eagles in subsequent matches, adding that he has learnt valuable lessons from the double-legged encounters with the Leone Stars. “My target was to win the two AFCON qualifiers and book the ticket here, but I am satisfied with the team’s performance. The two points still put the Super Eagles in vantage position to be at the AFCON,” he said. On Kelechi Iheanacho’s disallowed goal in the game, Rohr said, “I don’t know if the goal was offside or not, but we tried, we tried to play well on this difficult pitch and congrats to the players,” Rohr said. Meanwhile, former Super Eagles goalkeeper, Ike Shorunmu, is pleading with Nigerians to keep faith with the national team, stressing that castigating the team could be counterproductive .  Shorunmu, who praised the players for the 0-0 result they got in Sierra Leone, said the team has the brightest chance among the four sides in Group L to qualify for Cameroun 2021. He said, “Getting a draw in an away game, no matter the rating of the opposition, is commendable. “The coaches have to keep working on the players to bring out the best in them and insulting or castigating the players cannot help the team. “Sierra Leone scored four goals against Nigeria in Benin, but could not score even one goal in their country. That shows that the Eagles corrected their mistakes. I think they got a fine result.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
