Speaker of Gombe State House of Assembly, Abubakar Sadiq Kurba, has been impeached for alleged misconduct. The lawmakers also unseated the Majority Leader, Samuel Marcus, and Deputy Chief Whip, Yahaya Kaka, after a vote of no confidence by 16 of the 24-member legislature. The proceedings, presided over Deputy Speaker Siddi Buba, followed a motion moved yesterday by Shuaibu Haruna on the floor of the legislative chamber in the capital. Consequently, Abubakar Mohammed Luggerewo was elected new speaker, while Yerima Ladan Gaule and Saidu Mohammed emerged fresh majority leader and deputy chief whip. Addressing newsmen later, the majority chief whip, Musa Buba, who also chairs the House Committee on Security and Tender, stated: “We simply exercised one of our numerous responsibilities as enshrined in Section 92, subsection 2c of the 1999 (as amended).” On recent happenings in the Assembly, he said: “We just impeached the speaker by passing a vote of no confidence on him.” “You know we are under oath. There are some breaches we can’t disclose here. But in simple word, like you can see, we lack confidence in him, and have passed a vote of no confidence. He stands impeached,” Buba stated. He, however, disabused minds of residents of any link with the executive arm of government or any external forces in the entire episode, stating:  “No sponsorship. We are responsible people elected by our people on trust.” “We have a very good relationship with our governor. This is an internal issue, and we have taken correction. We love our governor and state,” he added. In his remarks, Luggerewo said:  “I want all to know that this action (impeachment) is in the interest of the state.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
