We won’t be having the normal scouting programme due to a lot that happened in 2020. So we have decided to come up with a tournament, more like an eight-a-side football championship. If you are a professional or amateur footballer, you can register with 12 players for the tournament and stand a chance to win a cash prize and a scholarship. Arrangements are still going on for the actual kickoff date of the championship in December,” she Barcelona forward said.
 
In the last few years, the Asisat Oshoala Foundation has produced over 10 players for the Nigerian national teams, ranging from the U-17, U-20, and the Super Falcons.
 
Two of the notable players that have made a mark through the Oshoala Foundation are Rashidat Ajibade and Chidinma Okeke, who have played for the Super Falcons and are currently plying their trade abroad.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
