No doubt, Nigerian Afro-pop singer, songwriter and performer, Yemi Eberechi Alade is one of Africa’s leading female artistes; her Black Magic and Woman of Steel, her third and fourth studio album, reinforced that feat. Yesterday, Yemi Alade, as she’s fondly called, released her fifth studio project titled, Empress. The 15-track album includes songs like True love, Yoyoyo, Maami water, Lose my mind, Dancina, Boys, I choose you, Control, Temptation (featuring Patoranking), Ice, Deceive (featuring Rudeboy), Turn up, Rain, and Double double. The actress cum activist in a move that is well-aligned with her desire for continental dominance, team up with some music heavyweights including French singers, Vegedream and Dadju, on Lose my mind and I Choose You, and South Africa’s revered show choir, Mzansi Youth Choir in Rain, as well as Nigeria’s mega stars, Patoranking in Temptation and Rudeboy (one half of defunct Psquare) in Deceive and British singer, songwriter, rapper, record producer, and actress, Estelle in Weekend. With her last album Woman of Steel, the original Igbo-Yoruba girl booked her place in the Afrobeats pantheon with the heavy, surreal collaboration with Grammy winner Angélique Kidjo. With Empress, Yemi immerses herself in spun from the grand themes of African royalty and sensibilities. Born March 13, 1989, Johnny crooner emerged on the Nigerian entertainment scene in 2009 upon her resounding victory at the fiercely competed Peak Talent Show. She was thereafter signed to Effyzzie Music Group, where she released the critically acclaimed hit, Johnny in 2014. Since then, Yemi has gained prominence in the music industry following the releases of her albums, King of Queens, Mama Africa, which made her embark on world tours consecutively; Black Magic and Woman of Steel. Applauded for her creative and overwhelming stage performances, fashion and music videos, her efforts was recognised and rewarded at the MTV African Music Awards, as she was honoured with the Best Female Artiste in 2015 and 2016 consecutively, and nominated for Artiste of the Year in 2015, making her the first female to win MAMAs Best Female Artiste consecutively twice and nominated for Artiste of the Year. In 2015, she became the first Nigerian female artiste to be nominated for the MTV Europe Music Awards (EMAs) for Best African Act and was nominated for the BET awards for Best International Act: Africa in 2015 and 2016. She has won The Headies award for Best Performer consecutively, 2018 and 2019. Yemi’s music has been of influence in many African countries and the world as she is acclaimed ‘Mama Africa’ for her versatility in using different African languages including Igbo, Yoruba, Pidgin, Swahili and French, as well as attires in her songs and music videos.
