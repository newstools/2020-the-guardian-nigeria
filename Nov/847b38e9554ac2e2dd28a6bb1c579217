Dolly Parton Finds The Secret To Youth In The Hands Of Her Surgeon The musical icon Dolly Parton admitted that she doesn’t have time to grow old while chatting with another legend, Oprah Winfrey. The 75-year-old singer and songwriter is ready to ‘look like a cartoon’ if that means defeating any form of aging, just weeks after revealing she’s considering posing in a spread for Playboy magazine. During a sit-down on AppleTV’s The Oprah Conversation, Dolly candidly spoke of her desires to gracefully age. As you reach each milestone age, I want to know what impact, if any, does the number have on you?’ Winfrey asked. I don’t think about my life in terms of numbers,’ she said. ‘First of all, I ain’t never gonna be old because I ain’t got time to be old. I can’t stop long enough to grow old. She optimistically added that she’ll ‘be the best I can be at whatever age.’ And if her attitude doesn’t hold up as easily, Parton knows her plastic surgeon is just one phone call away. I bet you I won’t look much different when I’m 95 if I live that long because I’m like the Gabor sisters,’ she said. ‘I’m gonna look like a cartoon. I’ll have on the makeup. I’ll look as young as my plastic surgeons will allow me and [with] all the makeup and lighting and all that. But I think more than anything, it’s about what comes from inside you. Dolly added that her youthful appearance isn’t what really counts. It’s an attitude and you gotta shine from within. Sometimes, that can make you feel young and make you seem young to other people. Parton revealed last month on the Scott Mills & Clark Stark Show that she’s considering posing for a spread in famed adult magazine Playboy. I just might do it. If I can do it in good taste and they [Playboy] want it, we’ll do it along with a really good interview inside,’ Parton said. ‘So, yeah, it’s possible. Yep, we’ve talked about it.’
