Speaking at the valedictory thanksgiving service in his honour in Lagos on Sunday, the air officer urged individuals to take up leadership responsibility, as “development of a nation is done through collective responsibility and not for one unit alone.” According to the retiring officer, the country belongs to everyone, adding that the opportunity given to him to serve as NAFRC Commandant enabled him to contribute to human development, which, in the long run, would benefit the general public. He said that adding value and impacting the larger society was in the DNA of the Nigerian Air Force (NAF), particularly when the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar, “has been known for improving standards.” His words: “My predecessors have done very well. There’s nobody who has visited NAFRC that has not expressed surprise at the quality of our infrastructure and the ambiance. You don’t do such thing in a day. My predecessors committed their time and resources to the country. “All I have to do was to build on what I met on the ground. I want to place it on record that it would not have been easy if those we took over from didn’t lay a good foundation.” Reminiscing his 42 years sojourn in service, the commandant said he did not set out to join the military, but for divine providence, stressing that he went to the Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA) to get busy, while awaiting his polytechnic admission. “When I was leaving the Nigerian Military School, my intention was to go to polytechnic to learn something technical and get busy in some productive activity. But I remembered that the NDA result was the first that came out that year in 1983 and I said let me report to NDA and when the other results come out, I can leave for any of those places. But as God would have it, none of those ones came out again. I remained in NDA and gave it my very best and here we are today.” Lar advised young officers to work hard and stop trying to influence their postings or promotions, stating that such things could not help them, but trust in God and adding value wherever they find themselves. He thanked the current administration of President Muhammadu Buhari for providing good retirement packages, adding that such would enable retirees contribute to national development. The deputy Commandant, Maj.-Gen. Akinyemi Olusegun, described the outgoing commandant as a professional, who believed in work before pleasure and called a spade its name without mincing words. Olusegun added that the outgoing commandant was a very focus person, highly intelligent and a persuasive leader, which other colleagues would attest. “For the three months I stayed with him, he has been a fantastic person,” Olusegun noted.
