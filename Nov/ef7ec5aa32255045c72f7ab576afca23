President Muhammadu Buhari’s niece, Rabiatu Mohammed, yesterday, ruled out the possibility of a woman becoming the governor of Katsina State in 2023, due to women’s lack of requisite experience. Mohammed, who is daughter to Buhari’s elder brother, the late Mamman Danbafale, however, urged women eyeing political positions, to instead, aspire for national and state assembly seats. Mohammed, who is Commissioner for Women Affairs in the state, stated this while highlighting some of the recent achievements of the ministry to newsmen in Katsaina. Her words: “To me, I don’t think it is possible for a woman to become Governor of Katsina State in 2023. But I know we are trying to create awareness for our women to come out en masse and contest in different positions. “We have the House of Assembly, Senate and House of Representatives. So, we are going to campaign to our women to come out and contest in 2023 so that we have a delegation from the women in Katsina State.” She said her ministry had trained and empowered no fewer than 500 women in various entrepreneurship programmes in the 34 council areas of the state from 2015 to date, in collaboration with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and the Northwest Entrepreneurship Development Centre (NEDC). She explained that most of what had been proposed for women in form of vocational skills acquisition and financial grants were truncated due to COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns, adding that adequate budgetary arrangements were being made to empower women across the state next year.
