Plateau State Governor, Simon Lalong, has urged Nigerians and others living in the country to support the development of golf among women, saying such support would aid in building a healthy nation. Speaking during the closing ceremony of the Lamingo Golf Club’s fourth Ladies Open, which held from November 5 to 7, Lalong said women should be encouraged to play the game as ‘it is for both men and women.’ Over 40 lady golfers participated in the tournament. Represented by the Plateau State Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Letep Dabang, Lalong added, “Golf is a game of unity as different tribes come together to play the game without discrimination.” Also speaking at the event, former Captain of the Club, Mr. Jang Dapoet, said he was there to support the ladies, adding that he was impressed by the performance of the ladies. Earlier, Captain of the Ladies Golf Tournament in Lamingo Club, Maryam Julde-Adura, thanked participants at the tournament for their support, saying, “This year has been a challenging year for our nation and the world driven by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The world came to a standstill and only just recovering. “Our beloved game of golf happens to be one of the human activities with lowest risks that allow people to continue to get the benefits associated with the game.
  
“The game of golf as an embodiment of life offers opportunities to enhance health, improve decision – making and build valuable relationships. Deciding to hold this championship is testament to the resilience that the game builds and our determination to continue to move ahead,” Julde-Adura stressed.
