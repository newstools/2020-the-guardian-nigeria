Office of the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Sustainable Development Goals (OSSAP-SDGs) has described as fake reports making the rounds that it was queried by the National Assembly over award of N26.9 billion COVID-19 related contracts. A statement by the Head of Communications, Mrs. Janet McDickson, stated that at no time was the office queried by the House of Representatives during its budget defence session or by any agency of government over the sum of N26.9 billion for procurement of COVID-19 items. “We therefore see this as fake news and a figment of the imagination of the author,” she added. The statement noted that “project implementation by the office is subject to budgetary allocations and releases of funds.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
