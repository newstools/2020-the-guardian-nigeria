Lawbreed Limited, the authorised publishers of Judgments of the Supreme Court of Nigeria (S.C. Reports) has sent a heartfelt message of solidarity and comfort to those who unfortunately lost their loved ones during the recent EndSARS protest that shook the entire country. Deputy Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the firm, Mrs Adejoke Layi-Babatunde commiserated with those whose businesses were looted and properties vandalized during the protests. Her words: “Our hearts go out to every family that have either lost loved ones or their means of livelihood in the recent unrest in our country. May they find comfort in the fellowship and care of fellow Nigerians. Our subscribers and customers who may have been affected should please contact us via lawbreed.com on how we can be by their side at this time. It would be recalled that the country was most recently thrown into a state of pandemonium where arson, vandalism, looting, and the like were the order of the day. “This is no doubt a trying period for most Nigerians, especially those who have suffered personal losses in varying degrees. May Nigeria overcome her challenges.    However, the task of building a safe, strong and prosperous country in which the rule of law is given pride of place is that of Nigerians. May God grant her the grace to be where it ought to be,” she stated. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
