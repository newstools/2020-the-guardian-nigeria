A senior security staff in the Nigerian Embassy in Germany has been suspended for allegedly soliciting for sex from a woman before renewing her passport in a viral video. “The Embassy of  Nigeria in Germany announced today that it has suspended with immediate effect a local staff (security unit),” the embassy tweeted on Tuesday. While the embassy did not give his name for “legal reasons,” the embassy noted the official had been “in connection with allegations of sexual abuse and other serious criminal activity.” The suspension came after a footage of the official identified simply as “Mr Martin” was caught with his pants down in a hotel room after he had allegedly asked the unnamed lady to have sex with him before he could release the passport. “Let me explain, please. Please, it is not like that,” a shocked Mr Martin said on camera. When asked to explain, he kept saying “please, please, please.” The voice behind the camera accused Mr Martin of several unwanton sexual encounters he had in the past in exchange for delivering his official duty. “Your cup is full, Martin. Your time is up,” the voice said. The embassy said “investigation is taking place with all the urgency and diligence that this very serious situation demands.” “When due process is complete, any guilty party can expect to face the full weight of the law. Our heartfelt sympathies are with any innocent victims of abuse,” it said.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
