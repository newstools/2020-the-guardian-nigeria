Alleges dumping of dead bodies in Onyeama valley Fiery Catholic priest and Spiritual Director of Adoration Ministry, Enugu, Nigeria (AMEN), Rev. Fr. Ejike Mbaka, has asked President Muhammadu Buhari to apologise, especially to the youths, on behalf of himself and his predecessors for failing Nigerians. Mbaka had been a staunch believer in Buhari as the country’s ‘messiah’ and supported his presidential bid in 2015 and re-election last year. While ministering on Sunday at the Adoration Arena in Emene, Enugu, the cleric also alleged that bodies of #EndSARS protesters killed by security agents in Enugu were thrown into the Onyeama valley. Many youths, according to him, are detained in various prisons across the country, arguing that Nigerian leaders should have been in such custody and not Biafra boys. He added: “This country can never be the same again. Few days ago, at Miliken Hill, after New Market, Enugu, people discovered bodies of those that were killed during the recent protest, while families of those young men and women continued searching for them. “That is why I am telling you that Nigeria can never be the same again. Whether you choose to misunderstand me or not, that is your headache.” The cleric, who had been criticised for his support for Buhari in 2019, after his unsatisfactory first term performance, added: “I know that by the time some of the leaders listen to this message, they will begin to attack Fr. Mbaka. But that is their headache, not mine. One day, enough will be enough.” He regretted that Buhari, who could have salvaged the situation, had also failed because he surrounded himself with the wrong advisers who “tell lies with NAFDAC number.” Efforts yesterday to get police reaction on the allegation by the cleric proved abortive, as Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) in the state, Daniel Ndukwe, did not respond to calls and text messages.
