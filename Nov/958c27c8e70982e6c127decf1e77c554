The National Orientation Agency (NOA), Cross River State is partnering the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), European Union (EU) and Communication For Development (C4D) on COVID-19 to boost child survival and maternal health care in the state. NOA, UNICEF and others had carried out an awareness Campaign on COVID–19 containment and key Household Practices (KHHPs) in Calabar and Ogoja, and the Acting Director NOA, Cross River State, Mr. Amissine Ogban, who led the C4D team during the campaign, stated that it has become necessary for the exercise to be carried out, as people need to observe NCDC Protocols on COVID-19 to stay safe and continue to remain healthy. Ogban said people should practice regular hand washing with soap under running water or use alcohol based hand sanitiser, use face mask, maintain social distancing, avoid hand shake and cough into sleeve, when necessary to avoid spreading or contracting the virus and called on youths to desist from cultism, stay off alcohol rape, violence against girl child and other vices.

The UNICEF Programme Officer of NOA in the state, Julie Atialekong, said the motorised campaign, among other things, was to reduce the risk of community transmission, create the required awareness on prevention and control of COVID-19 and increase uptake of Ante-natal care and routine immunisation, which is necessary for improved health. The Paramount Ruler of Ogoja, Ntol Akpogor Adom 3, thanked the Federal and State Governments, UNICEF and other partners for their contributions to ensure healthcare needs of the people is given needed attention in spite of the attendant fears associated with COVID-19 and tensions in the nation.
