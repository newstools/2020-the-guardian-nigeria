The African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM), a specialized entity of the African Union (AU), supports African countries in the area of credit rating agencies. As part of this mandate, the APRM undertakes routine reviews of rating opinions of African countries issued by international credit ratings agencies. Accordingly, the APRM has noted the downgraded by the two dominant international credit rating agencies – Fitch and Moody’ – on the 20th of November 2020 on the Government of South Africa’s long-term foreign currency credit rating. Whilst the rating actions have been justified by the two agencies, the APRM raises the following observations;  Based on these factors, the APRM will provide technical and operational support to; the South Africa credit rating liaison team in preparing for upcoming credit rating review, the National Treasury for implementation of admissible rating recommendations, and engage rating agencies on information exchange with aim of avoiding further downgrades.
