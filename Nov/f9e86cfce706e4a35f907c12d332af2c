The minister stated this at a virtual youth town hall meeting anchored by the President of Pan-African Young Women Development Initiative, Dr. Jophia Gupar, in Abuja yesterday. Speakers at the meeting include the Chairman of FCT National Youth Council of Nigeria, Mr. Ango Suleiman; Coordinator, Conference for Patriotic Citizens FCT, Mr. Zakari Babale; Vice President, North Central National Youth Council of Nigeria, Muktar Akoshile; National Coordinator, Association of Uniform Voluntary Organisation, Abraham Kwaghfan; and Johnson Michael. The minister argued that the youths needed to be included in their numbers as stakeholders in the planning and implementation of policies that concern them. She explained that the successes achieved by the FCTA during palliative distribution were due to youths who entered every nook and cranny of the territory to assist in distributing the items. Her words: “As your co-youth development personality, I have taken giant strides of ensuring that we enter into a partnership with some training bodies in the country, to engage FCT youths on sustainable entrepreneurship.” While appealing to youths to be their brothers’ keepers, the minister stressed that the town hall meeting was designed to achieve inclusiveness in governance among youths in the territory and beyond. Issues raised by the speakers include scaling up entrepreneurship among youths in the territory, environmental sanitation in rural communities, job creation, security, and a good road network in the councils.
