Speaking on his team’s fifth straight win against Benue Queens, Coach Aaron Okogie described the duel as a tough one, adding that the other teams always raised the game when they meet his side. “As I said after our first game, our ambition is to win the title. We have beaten most of the big teams, but some of the smaller teams are proving very difficult to play against. “It’s like they get extra motivation when they want to play against us. So, we have to be at our best always,” he said, adding that with four matches remaining in the female category, that he would prepare his players psychologically and technically ready for the remaining fixtures of the league.
