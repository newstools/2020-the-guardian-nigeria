The upturn was impacted by gains recorded in medium and large capital stocks, including Dangote Cement, Chemical and Allied Products (CAP), Vitafoam Nigeria, Dangote Sugar Refinery, and Oando. United Capital Plc said: “This month, with a sustained low yield environment and a rather expansionary monetary policy stance, the stock market will remain attractive for investors seeking high returns. “However, we do not rule out intermittent profit-taking by participants during the month. In all, we continue to see further uptick in the share prices of the tier one banks, food processors, Agro-allied companies, cement makers and the Telcos. “We advise investors to take cautious positions in the brewers, diversified consumer goods companies, and tier-two banks as they remain highly speculative.” Sentiment, as measured by market breadth, was positive with 24 stocks recorded gains relative to 18 losers.
