Honourable Folasade Ajala is excited by the way things have panned out for her this past year despite the challenges posed by COVID-19. The Lady Captain of Tiger Golf Club, Ibadan, who sees golf as ‘a game of life’, believes she is in the best community any forward looking lady can aspire to be in, saying that golf has made her realise that the only thing bigger than the sport is God. Although she says it will be difficult for her to quantify the gains in golf, she adds, “what I derive in golf in terms of health, social experience and even business networking cannot be quantified.” Reflecting on her odyssey from her first club, Ogbomoso Golf Club, where she started playing golf in 2011 on handicap 36, she said with commitment and constant practice, she has dropped the handicap from 36 to 16, winning many laurels in the process. Ajala, who was the Lady Captain of Ogbomoso Golf Club, claims her quest for improvement and more experience in golf prompted her to join Tiger Golf Club (TGC) and The Ibadan Golf Club (IGC) respectively. “To the glory of God, I have actualised some of the things I promised during my campaign. An example is our regular Friday kitty that is now more stable. “I promised to build a lady captain’s office here, and with the cooperation of my captain and the executive, the office has been completed and commissioned by the General Officer Commanding 2 Army Division, Major General Anthony Omozoje. “The lockdown really affected the game because at the heat of the pandemic, many people stayed off the course. It also affected the election of the executives and the economic conditions of the club, but thank God with all the preventive measures, activities have resumed fully in Tiger Golf Club”, said Sade Ajala, who is currently a board member of State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB), Oyo State.
