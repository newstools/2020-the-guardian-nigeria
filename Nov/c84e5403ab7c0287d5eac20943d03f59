As part of activities marking the 2020 Global Sustainability Week, employees of Dangote Group yesterday flagged off an employee volunteering initiative tagged: ‘Staying Safe Together, The Dangote Way,’ an initiative focused on enlightening the public about preventive and safety guidelines to battle coronavirus.
 
The weeklong activities focused on encouraging both young and old, most especially the womenfolk, to take care of themselves to avert a second wave of the pandemic in Lagos.   
 
The team of Dangote staff volunteers visited schools in Ikoyi environs and donated items like face masks, sanitisers and machines to help prevent the virus.
 
Yesterday, the team along with a doctor met with the Police Officers Wives Association (POWA) and the Army Wives Association to spread the gospel of ‘staying safe together’.  We went with a doctor and spoke to the students on keeping safe and maintaining good hygiene in order to keep diseases at bay especially the dreaded coronavirus.”
 
One of the highlights of the event was the account of one of COVID-19 survivors, who was invited to share her testimony. Ife Durosimi-Ettti, founder of AGS Tribe, narrated her experience and how she fought effortlessly to battle the deadly virus and sadly lost a 40-year-old sibling to COVID-19. 
 
“I fought COVID-19 symptoms in the month of June. The experience is not something that one can easily forget. Thank God I came out negative by June 27 after doing what I was told to do and using the medicine. COVID-19 is real. We have got to continue to use the facemasks and obey all safety protocols because we don’t want a second wave. We don’t want Lagos to be lockdown again,” she said.
