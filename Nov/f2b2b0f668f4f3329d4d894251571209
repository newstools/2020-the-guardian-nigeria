Theevent is slated to hold from November 6th to 30th. Jumia Nigeria CEO, Massimiliano Spalazzi made the announcement during the Jumia Sellers Conference, which was held recently. The conference usually holds every year before the Black Friday campaign kicks off. “The Black Friday campaign has been a success year-on-year, hence the reason we’re hosting it for the 8th time. As it has always been, this year’s campaign will focus on providing support for MSMEs, seeing that it’s been a rather tough year for a lot of businesses. This will be a great opportunity to recoup sales that may have run low due to the lockdown brought on by the global pandemic. It is also an avenue to give back to consumers by offering them amazing and cost saving deals,” Spalazzi added. Jumia in partnership with thousands of sellers and brands on its platform will offer consumers a wide assortment of products ranging from groceries, electronics, home items; and special deals such as flash sales and treasure hunts. “We know customers are always on the lookout for the best deals and as such, there will be a significant increase in inventory across all product categories, flash sales on top SKUs.” The website and App will also feature special stores which will allow buyers see offers pre-filtered by prices, free shipping offers. Our sellers are also not left out of this exciting opportunity, as we expect to see a daily increase in volume of sales throughout the month of November; in short, Christmas is coming early for everyone” said  Jumia Nigeria, Chief Marketing Officer, Olajumoke Bolu-Kujero.
