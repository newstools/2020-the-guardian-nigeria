Miss Chisom Egbunuche, the only daughter of ‘Nigeria’s oldest prisoner’, late Pa Celestine Egbunuche, has cried out over the abandonment of her father’s body in the mortuary more than a year after his death. She called on Nigerians to help her pay mortuary charges and bury her father.
 
Pa Egbunuche, who hailed from Amachara Owerre Village, Akokwa in Ideato local government area of Imo State, died on October 18, last year, a few months after he was released from Enugu prison.
 
Pa Egbunuche made headlines last year acquiring for himself, ‘Nigeria’s oldest prisoner’, after he clocked 100 years old in Enugu’s Correctional Service, where he was serving a death sentence on account of murder, alongside his only son, Paul. He had gone to prison in 2001 at the age of 82 and spent 18 years.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
