The leadership of All Progressives Congress (APC) has been charged to commence immediate review of the report rendered by Governor El-Rufai/Adetunmbi committee on restructuring to save the nation from further social cataclysms. Members of the Yoruba socio-cultural group, Afenifere, made the call after a meeting at the residence of its leader, Senator Olabiyi Durojaiye. In a 10-point communiqué signed by Durojaiye and Bayo Aina, leader and secretary respectively, Afenifere regretted the wanton destruction and loss of lives during the EndSARS protests in various parts of the country. The group commended all the governors of the South-West for setting up various mechanisms to assess the nature and extent of damages suffered by Nigerians in the hands of SARS, as well as the rampaging rioters. While noting that the South-West governors’ initiative in establishing “Amotekun” appeared to have been justified, the group stated: “Human life is irreplaceable, nonetheless, we suggest that families that lost loved ones be identified and every necessary step taken, including monetary appeasement while those who suffered loss of property be adequately compensated, to hasten the healing process.” Afenifere said reviewing the report of the EI-Rufai/Adetunmbi committee on restructuring, which was set up in 2017, should be with a view to presenting it for legislation to move the nation forward on the review of the 1999 Constitution. While sympathising with Lagosians and the people of South-West zone, including Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, the Oba of Lagos and Soun of Ogbomosho whose personal property were affected, the Yoruba socio-cultural group said many Nigerians who had to cope with significant disruption to daily living during the protest had to endure the unpleasant aftermath of a riot of unprecedented magnitude. The group, however, commended the courage and resourcefulness of Nigerians for finding ways to cope with the consequences of living with the protocols of COVID-19 for the larger part of the year, stressing: “Despite government and NGO-driven palliatives, the majority of citizens undoubtedly had to bear the main brunt of the challenges and this they did in a manner that has left the rest of the world wondering at our resilience.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
