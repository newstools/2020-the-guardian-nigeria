This means that in some instances, cases could be allocated to the wrong sub-districts. We are working with the sub-districts to clean and verify the data and where errors are picked up locally, cases will be re-allocated to the correct areas. The Western Cape has recorded 12 additional deaths, bringing the total number of COVID-19 related deaths in the province to 4415. We send our condolences to their loved ones at this time. Safety cabinet meets: Last month, we took the decision to allocate one cabinet meeting each month to focus on each of the key areas of jobs, safety and dignity and well-being. Our extended cabinet meetings include representatives from the district municipalities, the City of Cape Town, SAPS and law enforcement, and the new system allows us to receive full, regular reports on each of these areas with inputs from important role players. We held the first of these cabinet meetings focused on safety, where we received safety reports from each of the hotspot leads. We continue to use the hotspot management system we developed to monitor, track and report on COVID-19, to report on the three key recovery areas. The reports provided an overview of some of the issues being faced in the hostpot areas, and compiled key data which will inform our interventions. The safety focus of our recovery plan will be spearheaded by the HODs of Community Safety and Health- using the Cardiff Model. The Cardiff Model is a violence prevention strategy which focuses on sharing information between Health, police and local government. This system, when used in Wales, led to adjusted violence prevention strategies and interventions, which resulted in a significant reduction in violent injuries. During cabinet briefing, members of SAPS also gave a report back on their management of certain crime-related issues in the Western Cape, including on issues of extortion. This is a serious issue which is impacting many law-abiding citizens and we will continue to engage the police on their operations in this regard. We also once again call on Minister of Police, Bheki Cele to urgently convene the Transversal Steering Committee on Organised Crime and Extortion which was specifically devised to address these issues in the Western Cape, and which has not yet met.
