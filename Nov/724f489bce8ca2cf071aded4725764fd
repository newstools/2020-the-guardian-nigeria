The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has granted approval to two mobile network operators (MNOs), MTN Nigeria and 9Mobile, to carry out trials on workability of embedded Subscriber Identification Modules (e-SIM) service in the country. Running for one year, the exercise would involve testing 5,000 e-SIMs by the operators, subject to compliance with a number of regulatory conditions. The criteria include strict obedience by the MNOs to the Registration of Telecoms Subscribers Regulations 2011, Mobile Number Portability Regulations and Business Rules 2015, Guidelines on SIM Replacement 2017, and non-degradation of the Quality of Service (QoS) experience by users of e-SIMs. NCC’s Executive Vice Chairman, Prof. Umar Danbatta, said the primary objective of the trial was to assess the performance of the initiative prior to its eventual rollout. A statement yesterday by the commission’s Director of Public Affairs, Dr. Ikechukwu Adinde, quoted the EVC as saying: “The e-SIM is a technology that will eliminate the need for physical SIM card slots on mobile devices in the near future.” HOWEVER, in another document sighted by The Guardian, the NCC noted what it described as increase in the unauthorised change in shareholding structure by its licensees. It stated that the act is in breach of Regulation 42 of its Licensing Regulations 2019 and existing laws.The regulator restated that a licensee was required to give prior notice, and obtain the necessary approvals before rejigging its shareholding structure above 10 per cent of its total shares.
NCC said a licensee needs not notify the commission if it increases its share capital. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
