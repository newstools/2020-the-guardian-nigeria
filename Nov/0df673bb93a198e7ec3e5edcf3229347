Investigating Police Officers (IPO) attached to the Akwa Ibom State Police Command have allegedly rejected a bribe offer of N1, 995,000 from one Edet Okpo, who is facing a six-count charge of cybercrime and criminal defamation of character.
 
Okpo, 37, who is charged alongside his sister, Mary Okon Okwong, 48; Inyene Udo, 25; and others now at large, before Justice S.A. Amobeda of the Federal High Court, Calabar Division, was alleged to have withdrawn the money from a new generation bank branch in Uyo.
 
According to the charge sheet, the cash offered was aimed at compromising police officers investigating the allegations against the suspects.
 
The suspects were alleged to have demanded N200 million from the Rector of Maritime Academy of Nigeria through a WhatsApp conversation, using a phone line registered with fake identity and fingerprint of the second respondent.
