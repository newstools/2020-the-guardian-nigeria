Bello announced the donation of N260 million to the group, noting that provision of logistical support such as motorcycles, cars and firearms would also be made to equip them against bandits. Responding, Aliyu Makiga, vice-chairman of the group, appreciated the continued support of the state government which, he said, had assisted them with the wherewithal to confront bandits.
