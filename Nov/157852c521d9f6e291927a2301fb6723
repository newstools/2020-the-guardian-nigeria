While sympathising with the NPA management, Russo assured of PTML’s commitment to continue to work together and support the Authority.
He said: “We came here as PTML and Grimaldi to express our sympathy to the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) for the horrendous attack they suffered three weeks ago when the headquarters was burnt. “We came here to present this vehicle and this is a way for us to show our support to the Authority, because we know that in times like this, it is our duty to support NPA, which has always been very supportive to us and to the whole port industry. “So it is for us to show our commitment to work together with the NPA and express our solidarity and be with them in this very difficult period and to sympathise with them for this senseless attack because this has nothing to do with the EndSARS protest. This is just an attack by criminals, which we strongly condemn.” Responding, Abubakar expressed appreciation to the management of PTML for the donation and called on other stakeholders to emulate the gesture by supporting the Authority. He said: “PTML is the first to donate to the Authority as we have lost over 27 vehicles; over 300 computers, over 100 printers. Lots of photocopiers and other office equipment were stolen. “We wish to thank the management of PTML for taking it upon itself to relieve the Authority with this magnanimous gift. We recognise that you are one of our serious partners that listen to our needs at a time like this and we wish you very successful business at the port. We are thankful to the Almighty that they were not able to attack the port because that would have crippled the operations in the port.” Recall that at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, PTML and its parent company, Grimaldi Nigeria, collectively donated a total of N150million; 10,000 facemasks and 5,000 hand gloves to various arms of government in support of the fight against the spread of coronavirus in the country. While PTML donated N100million to the Federal Government’s COVID-19 Relief Fund Account created by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Grimaldi Nigeria donated N50million to the Lagos State Government. The facemasks and hand gloves were donated to Tin Can Island Port to support the Authority’s effort to check the spread of the virus at the nation’s seaport.
