The Joint Action Front (JAF) has berated the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) and Trade Union Congress (TUC) for accepting Federal Government’s deregulation and privatisation models, insisting that good governance was not as defined by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF).
 
It argued that the enthronement of privatisation and other anti-poor, neo-liberal policies, as advised by the World Bank and IMF by successive governments had foisted mass poverty, unemployment and a large number of out-of-school-children on the country.
 
Speaking at a media briefing in Lagos at the weekend, its Deputy Chairman, Achike Chude, and Secretary, Abiodun Aremu, urged Nigerian youths and the working masses to realise that the attainment of good governance was only possible through struggle against privatisation, commercialisation of education and other neo-liberal policies and fight for a system in which the needs of the people, not the greed and profit of a few, would form the basis of governance, production and wealth distribution.
