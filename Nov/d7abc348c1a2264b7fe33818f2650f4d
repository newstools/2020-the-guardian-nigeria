Eagles round off preparations today in Freetown  
Sierra Leonean officials may allow fans into the Siaka Stevens Stadium tomorrow to watch the African Cup of Nations qualifier between hosts, Leone Stars, and the Super Eagles. The Confederation of African Football (CAF) last week ruled that fans would be only allowed to watch the qualifying games to the Cameroun 2022 AFCON between November 11 and 17 if the respective countries give the nod. The Guardian learnt that the Sierra Leone FA officials are waiting on the country’s leadership to decide on the status of fans, as they believe having supporters in the stadium could lift them to victory over Nigeria. The Super Eagles are expected to hold their last training session today at the Siaka Stevens Stadium ahead of game. According to Super Eagles’ Media Officer, Femi Raji, the Eagles who had their last work out at the Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium, Benin City, Edo State yesterday evening, are determined to redeem their image in Freetown after the embarrassing 4-4 score line at the weekend. “The Eagles will land in Freetown today (Monday), after settling down in their hotel rooms, they will proceed to the stadium to have a feel of the pitch which is normal routine. “The Eagles are in high spirit and all hands are on deck to get the vital points in Sierra Leone,” he said.
