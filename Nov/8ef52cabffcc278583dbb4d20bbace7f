The Rivers State Ministry of Sports has entered into a partnership with Ottasolo FC of Lagos for football development. According to Rivers Commissioner for Sports, Boma Iyaye, the deal is part of the stateâ€™s programme of partnership with companies, organisations and individuals in the promotion and development of sports in the state. Speaking during the presentation of branded tracksuits to Rivers United by the chairman and proprietor of Ottasolo Football Club of Lagos, Mr. Gabriel Davids, at the conference room of the Ministry of Sports in Port Harcourt, witnessed by the Permanent Secretary, Sir Honour Sirawoo, and Rivers United officials, Iyaye expressed his delight over the gesture and reiterated that his ministry was interested in partnerships, while pointing out that the donation from Ottasolo is a testimony of how Public and Private Partnership (PPP) can work. He commended Mr. Davids for his interest in sports development, especially in terms of branding and ownership of a football club, which he says would go a long way in keeping the youth out of social vices. The chairman and proprietor of Ottasolo FC, Mr Gabriel Davids said he was moved to do the donation by the love and camaraderie showed by the sports commissioner upon his arrival in Port Harcourt.
