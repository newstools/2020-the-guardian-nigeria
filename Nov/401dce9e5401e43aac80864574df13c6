The Nigerian Institute of Management (NIM) chartered has tasked managers of organisations with committed leadership to enable them to navigate successfully through the crisis.
 
The institute submitted that emerging economies, like Nigeria, are today inundated with a host of management challenges, which demand careful planning and approach for survival.  According to him, a credible crisis management framework is critical to help maintain confidence in the people, system, and Government and it minimises risks.
 
He urged leaders to take charge because when a crisis happens, poor crisis management would often lead to anarchy.
 
He maintained that the survival and growth of a firm in a crisis situation is a function of its competitive advantage and strategies deployed to de-escalate the crisis. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
