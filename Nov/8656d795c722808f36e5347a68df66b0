Defending champions, Safety Babes of Abuja, were beaten 27-29 by the determined Edo Dynamos in yesterday’s opening match of this year’s Prudent Energy Handball League held at the Package B of the MKO Abiola Stadium, Abuja. In the female category match also played yesterday, the Seasider Babes defeated Defender Babes 28-26, while Kada Queens were overwhelmed by the firepower of the Imo Grasshoppers 19-27, in an almost one-sided matchup. However, in the male class, Rims Strikers defeated Plateau Vipers 30-26, while COAS Shooters walked over Borno Spiders, as Lagos Seasiders defeated Kada Stars 34-24. Speaking on his team’s feat against the defending champions, Edo Dynamos coach, Aaron Okogie, hailed his team’s shocking victory, adding that his team’s tactical superiority worked for them in their win over the defending champions. “It was a tough game, which we were able to win because of our tactical superiority. What we aim for at the championship is to finish top and go back to Benin with the trophy. “We finished second last season, so, the only way for us is up our game and hopefully, we will fulfill our potential at this year’s edition,” Okogie said, adding that it was too early for his team to be tipped as the favourites for the title following their performance against the defending champion.
