Stakeholders and members of Esan Youths Organisation (EYO), led by its Board of Trustees (BoT) Chairman, Prince Eromosele  Ehizojie Adenojie Aigbojie, yesterday, sued for collaboration by well-meaning indigenes who hail from Edo Central Senatorial District of the state in the development of Esanland. Aigbojie made the call at an enlarged meeting to officially declare open the Esan Homecoming Advocacy Campaign across the state. Rev. Albert Oboh of the Nigerian Baptist Convention stressed the need for all Esan people home and abroad, to be committed in ensuring their homeland is developed and not left to ruins. The BoT Chairman and leader of Esan Youths Organisation (EYO), Comrade Kingsley Ohens in their separate speeches, said the task to build the region is a collective responsibility. They sought the support of indigenes, particularly in projecting Esan Economic Revival Plans. According to the duo, Esan Economic Revival Plans is a roadmap for the socio-economic development of the Esan nation, targeted at floating cottage industries in the region for the production of rich native foods, other products for local and international exports. “The ceremony attended by members and stakeholders of the organisation, marked the beginning of the campaign to attract Esan people all over the world to the region’s developmental needs with the aim of fostering the unity and progress of Esanland,” they said.
