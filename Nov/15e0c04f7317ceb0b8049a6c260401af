LAKE Rice, a brand of locally cultivated and processed rice by Lagos and Kebbi states, has gone under, The Guardian has reliably gathered. Though Lagos residents have got used to the subsidised brand since 2013, they will probably not have access to the rice ad infinitum. If and when it comes back through the Lagos rice mills, it won’t be LAKE rice, and residents might have to pay unsubsidised prices.
 
The contract appears to have come to a close and its production dead based on two factors adduced for the stoppage. One has been affirmed by officials of the Lagos State Ministry of Agriculture, while the other factor revolves around the compelling forces of demand and supply following the Central Bank of Nigeria’s rice import policy and the Federal Government’s decision on land borders, which have been closed since August 2019. Lagos integrated rice mill
The Lagos State integrated rice mill at Imota is near completion, according the state officials, hence, the Memorandum of Understanding binding LAKE Rice production has become redundant. Officials of the ministry in Lagos said it is more economical to concentrate resources and efforts on completion of the rice mill, than continuing the partnership.  Competition for Kebbi paddies
The untold factor responsible for scarcity or complete absence of LAKE Rice is the stronger demand for locally produced paddies by indigenous and foreign rice mills. The closure of land borders with neighbouring countries in August 2019 has significantly shifted demand from imported rice to locally produced/processed one. As of now, prices of imported brands of rice range from N27,000 per 50kg bag to N32,000. Prices of local brands of rice range from N23,000 to N26,000.
 
Increases in prices are results of the Import Substitution Industrialisation (ISI) policy of the Federal Government, with the aim of decelerating pressure on the naira-dollar exchange rate and inflation, creating jobs and diversifying the economy.
 
Unwittingly, the policy has dealt a devastating blow to the Lagos-Kebbi rice production agreement, as demand for rice paddies in Kebbi has become highly competitive, with forces of demand and supply dictating who gets what.
 
To Lagos, it is no longer economical to subsidise expensive products in the face of gross infrastructural deficits and rising cost of governance, except on political grounds. And it has to stop!  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
