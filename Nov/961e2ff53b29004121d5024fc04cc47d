Former champions, Imo Grasshoppers of Owerri, defeated Benue Queens 28-16 in the ongoing Prudent Energy Handball League at the MKO Abiola Stadium, Abuja. The Owerri-based team showed class in the win, confining the new entrant to another defeat. In other games, Kada Queens lost to Safety Babes 20 – 25, Plateau Peacocks defeated Defender Babes 18 -15, while Rima Strikers beat Confluence Stars 32—27. Speaking on the teams’ performances at the competition, Handball Federation of Nigeria’s Technical Director, Ferdinand Emeana, expressed excitement over the emergence of new players and commended the teams for their industry on the court. “The competition has been going on well, hitch-free and very exciting. The teams are doing their best and no team is a pushover from what I have seen here,” he said. He described the emergence of Kwara Adorable and the Benue Queens as a good omen for the women’s game, adding, “The Kwara and Benue teams have young players who can form the bulk of the national team in future.” Emeana said the rivalry between teams has elevated the standard of the League. “We had thought that the pandemic will make the players rusty but I am impressed with what I have seen and hopefully the league title will go down the wire. It’s obvious that all the teams are well prepared that’s why it appears that top teams like Kano Pillars, Safety Shooters, and Safety Babes are struggling,” he added.
