Bangladesh, a nation of 161.6 million people who got independence from Pakistan by revolution only in December 1971 was lifted out of poverty in 1983. Yunus, that year established the Grameen Bank that granted loans to the poor without either collateral or interest. Fueled by the belief that credit is a fundamental human right, Yunus gave soft loans to develop small and medium enterprises which lifted Bangladesh to the prosperous middle-income group of countries. Yunus, an economics professor noted how credit had lifted Europe and North America into prosperity. Through the Grameen- like micro-lending more than 100 countries worldwide have liberated their peoples from poverty and want but excluding Nigeria. As a banker to the poor, Yunus was the recipient of the 2006 Nobel Prize for Peace. he has received numerous other awards for his creative ideas and endeavours, including the World Food Prize in 1994.
   
Sadly, Nigeria is deeply into social unrest, to the extent that many call it full-scale war with Boko Haram in Borno, Yobe, and Taraba and with bandits in Sokoto, Zamfara, Benue, Plateau, and Nasarawa states. Now, insecurity has caused the Beekeeping Extension Society to move the production of honey from Kaduna where a full-scale religious war is going on at the moment. The production of honey has been moved to Kano, Gombe, and Bauchi states. The representatives of the UN in a press statement announced that it spends $1.5 billion yearly on the humanitarian crises in Nigeria. In the first half of this year, bandits have killed 1,126 villagers. A commissioner on the Federal Character Commission from Taraba state Alhaji Abubakar Armiyau, attributed insecurity to injustice in the polity. Herders and farmers have clashed at Orire Local Government Area of Oyo, rendering agriculture impossible to be practised, leading to food scarcity in the future. More than 78,120 farmers abandoned farms in Borno with bandits abducting a bride and nursing mother in Sokoto.
   
All these led the former minister of Agriculture and chair of Arewa Consultative Forum, Chief Audu Ogbeh to enjoin the North to make peace among themselves or they will lose the North. This unrest has created palpable fear among farming families across the country, providing a major obstacle in the way of the agrarian masses in Nigeria. Upon the outcry, Nigerian troops just expelled terrorists in Toto Local Government Area of Nasarawa State with 410 suspects surrendering and bomb-making factory destroyed. Meanwhile, most rural dwellers in Nigeria, especially those from the North where these killings are taking place, are predominantly farmers. So, the most pervasive economic activity is being put on hold.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
