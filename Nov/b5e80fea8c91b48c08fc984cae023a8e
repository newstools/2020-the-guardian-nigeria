The Lagos State government has called on residents to change their attitude towards waste management to curb environmental pollution and protect the ecosystem.
 
Mrs Folashade Jaji, Secretary to the State Government (SSG), made the call during the flag-off ceremony of a seven-day intense cleaning of the waterways that began last Saturday tagged, ‘Lagos Coastal Plastic Search’.
 
She said: “With the upsurge in blockage of drainages and waterways with plastic bottles and water sachets, it is imperative for all to have a change of mindset towards the environment by disposing our waste properly, and to educate our children and wards against indiscriminate disposal at all times.”
 
According to the SSG, plastics endure for 450 years with its damaging effects on the ecosystem, constituting a threat to human and wildlife.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
