Residents of Festac Town and road users are lamenting over the pain they go through as a result of the total barricade of 2nd avenue, a major gateway to the town.
Â 
It was gathered that the barricade was ordered by the Area Commander, Area E, Festac Town, for fear of another possible attack on the station; but the action has thrown road users and vehicle owners living in the area into agony as they are now forced to use only one entry and exit point into the town.
