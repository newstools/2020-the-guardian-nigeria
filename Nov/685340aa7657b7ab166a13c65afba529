Nigeria still tops the table, though we should have won the ticket outright by beating Sierra Leone in at least one of the games. We have the Benin match to look up to, and a win is non-negotiable,” he said. MEANWHILE, Super Eagles former defender, Ifeanyi Udeze, has urged the Eagles to learn to play as a unit if they desired success in their games. He said, “Super Eagles need to keep being committed on the field. Losing concentration and not playing as a unit affected their performance in the first leg of the qualifiers with Sierra Leone. “They should focus on winning their remaining matches to qualify for the AFCON.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
