The management of Lagos State Signage and Advertising Agency (LASAA) has assured stakeholders in the industry that the agency remains the regulatory body for outdoor advertising and signages in the state. The Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of LASAA, Prince Adedamola Docemo, in a statement by the agency, yesterday, said there is no iota of truth in a reports credited to a chieftain of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) that Loatsad Media now regulates and controls the erection of billboards and signages in Lagos. Docemo said Loatsad Media Limited, owned by Mr. Seyi Tinubu, is merely one of the companies that have subjected itself to the rigorous process of registration with LASAA alongside over 200 other practitioners in the outdoor advertising space in the state. According to him, since the company is duly qualified to practice in the state, it would be unfair to deny it registration based on the personality of its owner, noting that LASAA regulation provides a level playing field for all players. “ It is therefore nothing more than wishful thinking, for any individual to insinuate that the agency has yielded its fiduciary responsibility to an advertising company that it regulates. We believe in a liberal market economy where all players will compete for the benefit of the market,” he said. Docemo reiterated that the outdoor advertising space and signages in Lagos are still under the regulation and control of LASAA which is statutorily empowered by law to carry out such responsibilities, adding that it has not transferred such to any other organisation.
