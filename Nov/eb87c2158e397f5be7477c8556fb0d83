  Implications
Responding to some of these curious fallouts, including the recount in Georgia, a US-based journalist, Simon Ateba, writing from Washington DC said: “For those who may believe Trump’s baseless allegations of fraud, the election being reported stolen from him, I would like to state that in Georgia for instance, there is a Republican governor and the Secretary of State in charge of the election is also a Republican and also a very close ally of President Trump. Dismiss Trump’s claims; he’s a bad loser. He’s telling the world that even his party members are conspiring against him.
 
“What happened was that Trump told his supporters not to vote by mail because he was trying to downplay COVID-19, while Biden encouraged his supporters to vote by mail and protect themselves against COVID-19. And in many states, they counted the in-person ballots first and Trump was leading by hundreds of thousands of votes and he went on television to falsely claim he had won. But when they began counting the other votes, he began to lose and to claim fraud without any evidence. When challenged to provide evidence, he set up an office in Arlington, Virginia; to solicit evidence from his supporters. The reality, however, is, Republicans are the ones overseeing the elections in many states that Biden is winning.”  Independent Candidacy, Social
Media Influence
Akinterinwa urged Nigeria to adopt the idea of fielding independent candidates as obtains in the US, adding: “There was a Nigerian-American, who contested in one of the districts in the US as an independent candidate. This is beautiful; contesting is only possible through the medium of political parties in Nigeria. This should not be. Independent candidacy has therefore become a desideratum in Nigeria in order to advance democratic culture.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
