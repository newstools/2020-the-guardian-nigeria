The beginning of the song leaves you pensive, and the end leaves you in (or nearly in) tears. Grammy-nominated Afro-fusion singer Damini Ogulu, popular as Burna Boy, has released a ballad in tribute to the peaceful EndSARS protesters who died from the shootings at the Lekki Toll Gate on the 20th October. The Afro-Pop song documents the gory killings of the innocent Nigerians who were sitting down, waving flags and chanting the country’s anthem when soldiers shot at them. Burna Boy, who is also among the key supporters of the EndSARS movement, with his funded billboard messages against police brutality, also documents the sad reality of corruption and its many ripple effects in the society, including police brutality, in the song. “Let’s talk about my government; open your mind and your ears; 20th October 2020; You carry army go kill many youths for Lekki; Water runaway my eyes; The money wey you thief yapa for your aza; you don turn our graduates to common beggars; all the book dem know no go matter; cause you no go get job if you no get godfather; We no go ever forget all the youths wey die for Toll Gate,” the song’s lyrics express, sadly and factually. Burna Boy has also announced that the proceeds from the song would be used to further help victims of police brutality in the state, beginning with the peaceful EndSARS protesters who were injured by the security operatives.
