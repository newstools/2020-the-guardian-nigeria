 Godwin Obaseki  Special Adviser to the Governor on Media and Communication Strategy, Crusoe Osagie, disclosed this on the sidelines of Obaseki’s inauguration for his second term in office, which he said, would be held alongside the annual Alaghodaro Summit. Governor Obaseki and his deputy, Philip Shaibu, will be sworn into office for another term of four years on Thursday, November 12, 2020. In a statement at the weekend, Osagie said the participation of Edo youths in the events was important to Governor Obaseki, who has assured that young people below 40 years would be given positions in the new cabinet. He said as part of the 2020 Alaghodaro Summit, a youth summit would be organised to evaluate how the policies, programmes, and initiatives of the Obaseki-led administration in the first four years in office have benefited youths in the state. “The governor acknowledges the role of youths in the actualisation of his second term bid. Youths make up over half of the state’s population. So, it is only right that they determine what works best for them in government.” “The 2020 Youth Summit will enable the state government to assess the impact of the administration’s policies and programmes on job creation, youth empowerment, basic and technical education and youths participation in governance, among others,” Osagie stated.
