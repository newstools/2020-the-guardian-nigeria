By reason of their recent nomination by the organisers of the annual Best of Nollywood award (BON), these sterling actresses- Adesua Etomi, Omowunmi Dada, Kehinde Bankole, Toyin Abraham, Toni Tones and Bisola Aiyeola – have been admitted into the unofficial club of Nollywood’s leading actresses or acting first ladies if you like. But who amongst them will emerge winner of the actress in a leading role category when the 2020 edition of the BON awards holds on December 5 in Ado-Ekiti, Ekiti State?
