The promoter, popularly known as Sola Ford, said while briefing the press at the weekend, that “boxing is a physically demanding sport that requires the fighter to be at pinnacle fitness and demands training in different ways in the build up to a fight, especially a world title bout.” He said the Scorpion’s trainer, Coach Sunny Bruce, a former Commonwealth champion, is working hard to sharpen the fighter’s skills, adding, “the trainer and Scorpion now train morning and evening with focus on vital areas to improve the boxer because working on punching alone is not enough. “They both do roadwork and work on his core and leg strength, this is where punch power comes from. They also work on footwork, and build his power and muscular endurance to enable him work at a high intensity throughout each round.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
