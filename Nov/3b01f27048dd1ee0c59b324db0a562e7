An independent online media that specialises in technology reporting, TechUncode, has been launched in Lagos.
   
The Chief Executive Officer, Charles Edosomwan, described TechUncode as a tech news platform that would communicate everything about technology in a simplified and interesting way.
 
Edosomwan stated that TechUncode, formerly called AskIfa, would inspire world-renowned technological innovative solutions from Africa.He said: “There is a need to tell the story of Africa from an African view. All over the world, it is believed that Africans consume technology rather than invent. It is thought that most world-leading software and hardware solutions are primarily from other continents of the world. This may be true or not.
