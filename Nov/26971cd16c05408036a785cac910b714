Borno State Governor, Prof. Babagana Zulum is to shut the Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) camps on or before May 2021.
According to the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), the state government has 145 IDP camps in Maiduguri, Dikwa, Monguno, Rann, Pulka, Banki, Gwoza and three border communities with Cameroon. Zulum disclosed this, yesterday, while unfolding a 25-year recovery and development plan at the Government House, Maiduguri.He called on the 192 Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) in the state to key into the state’s reconstruction, rehabilitation and
