The Barca Academy Lagos will resume on Monday to complete its programme for the year, the sponsors of the academy have announced. Rising from a stakeholders and technical team meeting at the Teslim Balogun Stadium, Lagos, the Barca Academy Group said the recent lift of ban on contact sports by the Federal Government has made it imperative for the academy to resume albeit in compliance with all the protocols specified by the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19. A statement signed by Barca Group’s Head, Communications, Development and Growth, Abibatu Abudu Ajayi, said the academy will resume its activities at its facilities across Lagos, adding it “would afford us enough time to begin to prepare for next year’s global competitions in Barcelona, Spain, in 2021, since they were not held this year due to the global pandemic.” The statement revealed that the academy’s facilities at the Teslim Balogun Stadium, Lagos, has been opened for activities and for the young persons who want to enroll for trials for the Elite Scholarship Project. “We wish to use this opportunity to thank all our core stakeholders, particularly our children and their parents for their support and assure all our stakeholders that we will keep walking on the path of our culture, which is excellence, and professionalism, very mindful of our people oriented nature for our words is our bond.” Ms. Ajayi stated. She explained that the Barca Academy World competition, which would have been held in April this year, is likely to be scheduled for the same time or moved to a later date in the new year. Ms. Ajayi added that the Barca Academy is working out modalities to open free opportunities for good, talented and interested young girls to play football, “now that CAF has taken women football to a competitive league level in the African continent.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
