Apex Igbo socio-cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, yesterday, said it was disturbed over the orgy of violence in Oyigbo Council Area of Rivers State that has resulted in destruction of lives and property of Igbo resident in the area. In a statement issued by President General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Chief Nnia Nwodo in Enugu, the group condemned the dehumanising treatment meted to innocent Igbo at Oyigbo. It however, regretted how wrongdoings of some youths from the South-South and South East and “inciting mindless and provocative statements” made abroad by the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, inflamed passion on both sides and dovetailed into chaos. “Pictures on the social media portray very inhuman and degrading treatment meted to innocent Igbos in Oyigbo.  Ohanaeze regrets that the friendly and cordial relationship, which existed between Igbo and our kit and kin in Rivers State, is threatened by this development. “So also is the threat to our solidarity with PANDEF and the entire people of the South -South region of Nigeria. We are in consultation with Chairman of South East Governors Forum, Dave Umahi, who has volunteered to arrange a meeting between Igbo leaders and Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, to arrest further drift of the situation. Nwodo assured that innocent Igbo in Rivers State who were caught in the violence and whose lives and livelihoods were threatened would not be abandoned.
