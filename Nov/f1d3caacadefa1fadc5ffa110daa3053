The Livelihood Improvement Family Enterprises- Niger Delta (LIFE-ND) will train 4,025 people in Abia State in agri-businesses, who will be empowered to start up their businesses. The National Coordinator, Mr Sanni Abiodun, disclosed this to The Guardian through the Agribusiness Promotion Coordinator, Mrs Antonia Esenwa, during the a one-week residential business orientation training in Umuahia for 150 people who were selected from 25 communities in 10 of the 17 local government areas of the state. Esenwa said the project, which is aimed at enhancing income, food security, and job creation for rural youths and women through sustainable agribusiness enterprise development in the Niger Delta, is being funded by the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC). According to her, “LIFE-ND targets the unemployed and under-employed youths aged 18-35 years and women-headed households with children under age 15 to be engaged in the production, processing, and marketing of rice, cassava, oil palm or poultry in their communities, saying: “It is hoped that at the end of the first phase of this project, 4,025 Abians will have been empowered using incubation model for implementation.” The state LIFE-ND Coordinator, Dr Uchenna Onyeizu, said upon successful completion of this training, the participants would be attached to incubators to enable them to gain hands-on experience and training on the best practices in the agro-business activity of their choice and thereafter be empowered with start-up logistics. While the state Commissioner for Agriculture, Prof. Ikechi Mgbeoji, urged the trainees to invest their start-up logistics profitably, the state Agricultural Development Programme Manager, Chief Israel Amanze, said agriculture is now one of the most viable sectors to invest in.
