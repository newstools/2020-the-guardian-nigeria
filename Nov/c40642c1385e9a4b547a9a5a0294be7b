The Federal Government has initiated entrepreneurial training and manpower development in agriculture for youths across the six geo-political zones.
 
The programme, which kicked off at the National Center for Agricultural Mechanisation (NCAM), Ilorin, Kwara State, is aimed at empowering Nigerian youths, especially in agriculture and entrepreneurial skills. Starter packs will be doled out to all the participants at the end of the program.
 
According to the Executive Director of the NCAM, Dr. Yomi Kasali, the scheme, if executed diligently, would boost Nigeria’s Gross Domestic Products (GDP) and allow the nation to diversify the economy.
 
The programme started with over 100 youths across the states in the South West. The South West event was sponsored by Senator Teslim Folarin, representing Oyo Central Senatorial District of Oyo state. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
