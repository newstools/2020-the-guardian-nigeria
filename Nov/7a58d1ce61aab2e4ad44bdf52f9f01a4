The Office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA), which is coordinating the border closure exercise, has approved the release of over N130 billion goods stuck at the Seme border, more than one year after President Muhammadu Buhari ordered the abrupt closure of the borders.
 
The approval was conveyed in a letter signed by Major General E.A. Ndagi, on behalf of the National Security Adviser, dated November 13, 2020, and addressed to the Comptroller-General of Customs, Hameed Ali.
 
National President, Association of Nigerian Licensed Customs Agents (ANLCA), Iju Tony Nwabinike, had recently expressed worries that trucks laden with goods worth over N130 billion belonging to private businesses have been trapped since August 18, 2019, when the borders were shut.
