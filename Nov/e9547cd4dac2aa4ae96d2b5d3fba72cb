House of Representatives Committee on Army has decried the N27b capital allocation to the Nigeria Army in the 2021 budget. Chairman of the Committee, Abdulrazak Namdas, who spoke at the 2021 budget defence of the Nigeria Army amounting to N509b, said N7b allocated for the procurement of arms and ammunition was grossly inadequate. Namdas (APC Adamawa) expressed appreciation for the recognition of soldiers for their role in securing the country, adding that the amount could embolden bandits and terrorists to sustain their nefarious activities in the country. He charged the Nigeria Army authorities to guard against over reliance on foreign made weapons not readily available due to politicking and other mundane motives of advanced countries of the world. Charging the Nigeria Army to exhibit professionalism and transparency in the usage for budgeted funds, he admonished the soldiers to focus on the central engineering depot as part of efforts to manufacture weapons locally. He also pledged to work assiduously towards the increase in the welfare of soldiers to boost their confidence in prosecuting the ongoing war against terrorism and other forms of criminalities in the country. Chief of Army Staff, Lt.-Gen Tukur Buratai, who was represented by Gen. Lamidi Adeosun, assured of the Army’s commitment to professionalism in line with the country’s constitution.
