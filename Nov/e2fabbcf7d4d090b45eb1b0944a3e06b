From the piano chords that usher the listener into the song, you instantly get a relaxing and dreamy feel. Jisike is an Afro RnB song by Nigerian-British singer and London’s Loughborough University’s first black PhD holder, Adaku Agwunobi. It is an enchanting record that seeks to pacify and encourage the average man through the daily struggles of life. “They don’t know the times are hard; Hold your head high, you made it to another day; everything is going to be okay; Chukwu Gozie gi; Everything is going to be okay; Ogadinma,” the hope felt throughout the song peaks from the intro and crescendos at the same soothing but energetic momentum. One of the most intriguing parts of the song is its therapeutic ambience. Apart from having such thoughtful and enchanting lyrics, the song’s vocal harmony – which is greatly reflected in how Adaku’s voice compliments the serene instrumentals – conspire to create a nerve-relaxing feeling in the listener. “I wrote the main verse of Jisike during the peak of the pandemic; I wrote it because of the ongoing injustice and uncertainty. I wrote it for everyone who has ever struggled and continues to struggle. Jisike is a word that has always made me instantly feel better from a young age. I wanted to make a song where people can just close their eyes, take a deep breath and relax,” Adaku tells Guardian Music. Produced by Lagos-based sound whiz, Ken Hamilton, alongside, ThankGod Chidiebube, a.k.a Thankykit, Jisike is poised to be a prized addition to every playlist, bearing its gifts of healing and relaxation to every listener. Jisike is the first official single from her forthcoming Extended Playlist, titled Enerj, which was released independently on November 20.
