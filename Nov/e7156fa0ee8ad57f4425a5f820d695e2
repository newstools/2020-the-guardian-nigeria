Miley Cyrus And Dua Lipa Accused Of Plagiarism London-based pop punk band Dream Wife have taken to Instagram to claim Miley Cyrus and Dua Lipa’s new Prisoner music video is a ripoff of their music video for the track So When You Gonna. The pop starlets joined forces for new single Prisoner with the chaotic music video seeing the pair share the screen for the first time as they embark on a wild bus journey according to reports by The Mirror. However, Dream Wife have taken to Instagram to claim the video is a ripoff of their own music video for the track So When You Gonna, which was released in May. Both videos show a POV shot from inside an open mouth, framed by teeth. Miley and Dua are dressed as punk stars and are seeing performing at a gig – in a parallel to the video by Dream Wife. The band shared several side-by-side images from both videos on their Instagram account and accused the due of stealing their work. One image showed Miley and Dua performing, while another shot shows Dream Wife on stage in a similar pose in their own video. They captioned their post: “Thought the new Miley vid looked familiar… those pearly white LA teeth needs some grit tho. rofl.” The band also posted a side-by-side image on Instagram Stories of Miley holding a guitar next to band leader Alice doing the same, with both seen through the open mouth shot. It isn’t the first time Miley has been accused of plagiarism. In June 2019 the Wrecking Ball star got slammed on Instagram after copying a feminist baker’s cake design and not crediting her. The singer posted a photo of herself licking a cake decorated with the words “Abortion is Healthcare” to promote her collaboration with fashion designer Marc Jacobs and Planned Parenthood. Dua Lipa and Miley Cyrus Representatives are yet to reply to the accusation.
