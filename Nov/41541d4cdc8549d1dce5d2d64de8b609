Behind those pretty eyes and gorgeous smiles are dark secrets that only time can unravel. It is a representation of the expansion of my music into new spaces and hints at one of the many layers of my coming debut album which I am excited about and cannot wait to share with the world!”, says Johnny Drille. With “Mystery Girl”, Drille hopes to journey listeners to a whole new realm of experiences, showcasing his range through lyrics and genre-bridging sounds. Here is a fan link to MYSTERY GIRL.
