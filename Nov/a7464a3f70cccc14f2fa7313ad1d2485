NOC sets programme for federations’ preparations 
Nigeria will continue its campaign to pick slots in the judo event of the 2021 Tokyo Olympic Games this weekend when it features in a series of championships lined up by the African confederation. First of the championships is the African Open billed for Yaoundé, Cameroun from November 7 to 8. The team will also feature in the African Open Championship in Dakar, Senegal on November 14 and 15. From December 21 to 27, the Judo team will have the final chance to pick more Olympics tickets when they feature in another African Championship in Madagascar. Nigeria Olympics Committee (NOC), Phemmy Adetula, said the NOC would monitor the three major championships to ensure the country picks many slots to feature in the Japan Olympics next year. “Our judokas can still pick points that can qualify Nigeria for the Olympics and the NOC is working at the administrative level to put things in the right shape for next year’s Olympics,” he said. The 2021 Olympics, which would have been held this year, was moved to next year due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic across the world.
