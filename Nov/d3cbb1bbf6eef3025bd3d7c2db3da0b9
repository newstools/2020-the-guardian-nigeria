Following the COVID-19 pandemic that has continued to plague the world, young business man and real estate player, Kingsley Obiukwu has called on the Federal Government to as a matter of urgency work towards preventing another lockdown as it would be disastrous to the economy of the country. Obiukwu was speaking on the effect of the coronavirus on businesses and the lives of common Nigeria. According to him, the country can’t bear a second wave of a lockdown as it would be tantamount to anarchy and unrest , just as witnessed during the #EndSars protest. In his words, “We have not regained the damages incurred on businesses and across the country as a result of hoodlums hijacking the #EndSars protest. We are hearing that there might be a second wave of a lockdown. The government shouldn’t allow that to happen. The hospitality manager adviced that the government should continue to sensitise the people on the need to follow all COVID-19 guidelines. He added, “the Nigerian government must be sincere in helping small scale businesses because they are the powerhouse of the people.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
