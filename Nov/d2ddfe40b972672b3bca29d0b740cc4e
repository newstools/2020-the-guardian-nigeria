Organisers of the second Governor Wike Pre-season Tournament have assured that the Sharks Stadium will be ready for what is regarded as the most star-studded preparatory competition in Nigeria. Speaking during an inspection tour of the facilities in place for the competition, which kicks off on Friday, member of the organising committee in charge of venues, Chuks Ezeji, said the Sharks Stadium has hosted several local and international football competitions in the past and as such, the pre-season football tournament would not be an exception. “I can assure you that the stadium will be ready for the competition. Port Harcourt has always been a good host and we will make sure this is no exception. “The Ministry of Sports has provided the needed funds and logistics, so we are putting finishing touches to all areas to ensure a good job,” he added. Also speaking during the tour, Chairman of the Organising Committee, Bashir Badawiy, said he was impressed with the level of interest from clubs across Nigeria. According to him, “Till this moment, clubs are still contacting me, wanting to be part of it. Unfortunately, we cannot accommodate all the clubs. “The teams coming to Port Harcourt will have a great time and we are happy to welcome them. We are ready and we expect to have an exceptional tournament.” Badawiy reiterated that all COVID-19 protocols would be observed throughout the competition.
