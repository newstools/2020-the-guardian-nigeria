A Kebbi State youth group, Youth Political Vanguard, has vowed to make candidates seeking political positions in the 2023 general elections sign a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the people after their screening. The leader of the group, Kabir Gainyat, who spoke with journalists, yesterday, said that despite the closeness of any candidate with the government, the youths were ready to fight for the cause and ensure good governance, adding that the coming general elections will be for serious-minded persons who will make the masses feel the impact of democracy. He said: “We are ready to make a change this time around. We don’t want anybody that can be a threat to the people. We must screen any candidate and ask him to sign an MoU with the people of Kebbi State.” Kabir, who is also the Chairman of 4+4 Atiku and Buhari Campaign Organisation, urged the people of Kebbi State to make a wise decision by electing credible candidates for political positions, saying: “We should produce seasoned civil servants who know in and out of the state and ready to support the people of Kebbi State and be able to execute meaningful projects.” In a related vein, the Kebbi State Peoples Redemption Party (PRP) has expressed its dismay over the way the ruling party (APC) is governing the state. A statement signed by the party’s Public Relations Officer, Abubakar Dakingari, which was made available to newsmen, yesterday, in Birnin Kebbi, said that the present administration had turned civil servants to beggars and also shifted some government activities to Abuja. He chided the state governor for not centralising government activities, urging him to act urgently and bring sanity to governance.
