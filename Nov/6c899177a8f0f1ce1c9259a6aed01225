ASUU, which is the umbrella academic body of Nigerian public universities has been on strike for several months now with meetings to resolve it with the Nigerian government proving futile. The union going on strike now appears to be an annual occurrence with several Nigerian students attending universities under the academic body adding extra years to their course of study due to the incessant strikes. Simi in her rant against the government for its actions and inactions lamented that Nigerian leaders “don’t have compassion on their own people.” According to her, the government takes away the dreams and hopes of the youths with some students having to spend eight years for courses that should take four years. She shared: “Higher institutions on strike for months almost, if not every, year. The odds are always stacked against the average Nigerian. You spend the first half of ur life just trying to survive. To eat. To catch up. When you finally decide to settle, you don’t have enough to do even that. Taking away the hopes and dreams of the youth. Destroying their futures so they’re ready to settle for crumbs. Just so they can live to see the next day and fight for more crumbs. Because they’re not your own children, their futures don’t matter???? Shame on you!!! If the leaders in our own country can’t have compassion on their own people, then what can we really do? They get into power and abuse it, abuse the people they should be serving. The rest of the world laughing at the so called giant of Africa. Shame on all of you!! Imagine doing a 4yr course for 8 years…still no job. This modafukkin wickedness is too much.” Simi has always been vocal about socio-economic issues affecting Nigeria. Recently she disclosed to SDE Pulse that she was an active part in the recent #EndSARS protests that rocked Nigeria because she is passionate about the country. She said: “I’m passionate about it because as far as I’m concerned, I don’t have a choice. Nigeria is my country and I was born and raised in it and I want to be proud of it.” “I’m passionate about it, because as far as I’m concerned, I don’t have a choice. Nigeria is my country and I was born and raised in it and I want to be proud of it.”
