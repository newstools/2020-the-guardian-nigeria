Kuti, while addressing the press yesterday at the Kalakuta Museum in the Ikeja area of Lagos, said the days in which members of his family were being harassed by security operatives appear to have returned. He vowed to mobilise citizens to rise and defend their rights under the aegis of the revived movement.
