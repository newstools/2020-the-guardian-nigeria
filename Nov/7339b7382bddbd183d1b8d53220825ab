• Election Long Overdue  — PDP

• Election To Hold Soon, Says Somorin One year after the exit of democratically elected Local Council officials in Ogun State, the delay in the conduct of the council poll is gradually giving rise to doubt and anxiety, as transition committees continue to manage the affairs of the councils.  The current administration has attributed the delay to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic that locked-down the country for months. Sometime in July, the governor was also quoted saying the effect of the pandemic has not allowed the conduct of the local council poll. The Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, Afolabi Afuape, sometime in September, during a radio programme in Abeokuta, confirmed that the council poll couldn’t hold this year. He blamed the delay on COVID-19 pandemic, saying it did not allow government to source the huge amount of money needed for the election.  The main opposition party in the state, the PDP, which told The Guardian that the election is long overdue, noted that the local council administration is dead in the country. Publicity Secretary of the party in the state, Sunkanmi Oyejide, who lamented that local council administration is no longer what it is used to be, said before now, massive development was witnessed at the grassroots as a result of the autonomy given to the councils.
 
“The council election is long overdue. We understand clearly that there was pandemic at a point, but now that normalcy has returned we expect this administration to quickly conduct the poll so that the grassroots will start witnessing development. Not only conducting the election, the most important thing is to give them autonomy to allow them function independently; they don’t need to be waiting for directives from the state government.
 
“So, the governor and his men should swing into action and conduct a free and fair local council election, an election where OGSIEC will be allowed to do their job without interference from the government, we want an election, not selection, they should allow the will of the people to stand as witnessed in the last governorship election in Edo State, where people’s wish prevailed.”  Somorin, who said the governor, gave the promise during an interactive Ogun Youth- Government Townhall Meeting, at the June 12 Cultural Centre, Kuto, where he noted that what the state would be having is an election and not a selection process. He further disclosed that the government would soon begin the process of the election by constituting the OGSIEC, which would be responsible for rolling out the calendar for the election.
