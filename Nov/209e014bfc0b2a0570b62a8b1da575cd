 Branka Mracajac  This follows the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), final approval to 9PSB to commence operations in fostering financial inclusion drive in the Nigerian ecosystem in August 2020. The debut of the platform becomes imperative as bank customers continue to encounter numerous challenges such as regular long queues in the banking halls, consistent network failure, stringent documentation to access credit facilities, and frequent transaction/dispensing error, among others.  On targeted customers, she said: “I would say that we are targeting every Nigerian, of course our purpose here is financial inclusion but we are not limited only to other banking populations. We think we can offer better services even for bank clients.
  
“We are independent of 9Mobile, that is, we stand alone and not a branch of 9Mobile. Our relationship is a business for business relationship. 9PSB has its own board; in fact, the regulator stipulates that it must be independent.
 
“We will deploy a wide network of agents in rural areas to start educating clients who don’t have the opportunity to have access to banking; we will also build trust and educate them on a daily basis on how to use banking services.”   To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
