As fertilizer scarcity lingers across Nigeria, the country seems to be returning gradually to the old fertiliser distribution regime, a development posing serious threats to farmers’ productivity.
 
Before the Goodluck Jonathan regime, the old system of fertiliser supply was weak, inefficient and allegedly fraudulent. A large proportion of intending beneficiaries could not get access to the product. Investigations showed that bags of fertiliser were diverted for personal gains and when supplied, they were either adulterated or underweight.  He said with the Fertiliser Quality Control Act fully in force, private sector players would obtain certificates of registration or sales permits after payment of some prescribed fees/charges before being allowed to operate any fertiliser business in the country, saying the fees are the least when compared to what is obtainable in other related sub-sectors agencies within the country and the ECOWAS sub-region.
 
The minister stated that the primary goal of the fertilizer regulatory system is to increase agricultural productivity for national food security, which could only be achieved through the provision of quality fertiliser and other key farm inputs.
  
Nanono said under the new regime, fertilizer adulterators are liable to five-year imprisonment without an option of fine, adding that magistrates’ courts have now been given the jurisdiction to try cases of fertiliser adulteration, unlike before where only the high court was allowed to try such cases. 
 
He said the Farm Input Support Department of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development has become the implementation agency for the Act, and the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) no longer has the power to regulate the subsector.
