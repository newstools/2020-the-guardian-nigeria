I loved you more than the sky in Texas,” she wrote. “You made me more mad than anyone I’ve ever met, and I loved every ounce of you for it. Rest In Peace. You’ll always have my heart.” Police are asking for help in identifying a suspect or suspects and are offering a reward of up to $2,500 for information that leads to an arrest.
