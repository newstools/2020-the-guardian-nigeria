The Federal Ministry of Health is set to strengthen its supply chain mechanism to improve service delivery to the consumers. The ministry’s Director of Food and Drugs Services, Mr. Fubara Chukwu gave the assurance at the launch of the Global Fund Malaria funded Strategic Training Executive Programme (STEP) for senior government executives in Abuja. Chukwu said the launch of the programme would provide an avenue for leaders in the ministry to understand how the supply chain works. He hoped the initiative would give an opportunity to participants for a change in mindset so that they could provide services that are delivered in a qualitative manner. Chief Executive Officer, Africa Resource Centre for Excellence in Supply Chain Management (ARC Nigeria), Mrs. Azuka Okeke, at the event, said the programme was design to bridge the gaps that evolved due to the new strategic thrust of the ministry. “This programme is therefore intended to complement existing leadership skills with private sector resources needed to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the public sector,’ she said. Similarly, Chairman, Board of Director, ARC Nigeria, Mr. Wale Adedeji promised that more innovative programmes aimed at improving health indices in the country are coming on board following the progression of ARC Nigeria from a project to a full entity ready to stand on its own.
