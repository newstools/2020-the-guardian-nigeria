Chairman, Ebonyi State All Progressives Congress (APC) Caretaker Committee, Stanley Okoro Emegha, yesterday, urged citizens of the state to work with their heads rather than criticise Governor David Umahi for defecting to the party. He said it was insulting to ask if Umahi was planning to contest for the nation’s presidency in 2023, saying the governor had the constitutional right to do so. Okoro stated this known while addressing members of the Ebonyi Council of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) during  their visit to the Old Government House, Abakaliki. He urged President Muhammadu Buhari to hand over to Umahi for a better country. “People no longer think. Governor Umahi is a two-term governor and will not contest for governor again. If he is looking for a Senatorial seat, it will be a gift, as far as Ebonyi State is concerned. “But if as a Nigerian, he decides to vie for the presidency, does he not have the capacity to do so? If he becomes the President won’t he do well? It is even better to hand over to Umahi as an engineer, who knows the country’s governance structure,” he said. Speaking, Chairman of the state council of NUJ, Comrade Tony Nwizi, charged the APC to accommodate and give fair hearing to all members to enable them to move the state forward.
