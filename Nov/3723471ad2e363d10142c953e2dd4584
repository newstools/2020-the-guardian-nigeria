In a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, the opposition PDP said the visit indicated that “the APC, in 2015, only created artificial symbols of misgovernance, corruption, and other alleged misgivings just to discredit our party and grab the levers of power to achieve its members’ selfish desires.” The party claimed that the Jonathan administration succeeded in office basically because it understood the nuances of the country, which were translated into people-oriented policies and programmes, in line with the manifesto of the party, to make life comfortable for Nigerians. “This visit to Jonathan by the APC governors is a direct acceptance of the successes recorded by our party in building a strong nation with a virile economy that was rated as one of the fastest-growing economies of the world. “The visit is, therefore, a subtle step by APC governors into the corridors of the PDP in agreement that our party holds the solution to the myriads of problems brought to our nation by their APC and President Buhari,” the statement read in part.
