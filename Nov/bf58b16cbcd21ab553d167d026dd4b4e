 Olalere Odusote  “In the first quarter of 2019, 47 per cent of the LPG consumed in the country was imported from the United States, majorly. Other marginal suppliers were India, Argentina, Algeria, Trinidad and Tobago, and Equatorial Guinea. This is a drain on the country’s foreign exchange earnings,” he said.
  
He said it was imperative that the Nigeria LNG Limited (NLNG) picks up much of the slack in domestic gas supply in the short-to-medium-term.
  
He advised that the annual allocation of LPG be scaled up from the current level for the domestic market because of positive demand projections.
  
“There is a general sense of optimism that the domestic liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) market will benefit significantly from the Train 7 project of the NLNG upon its completion. At the moment, NLNG produces one million metric tonnes of LPG and supplies 350,000 metric tonnes of the product to the domestic market, accounting for 50 per cent of LPG supply in Nigeria.     
  
“With the additional capacity of the plant, the production and supply of LPG to the domestic market is expected to increase, thereby deepening the penetration of the low-cost and high efficiency cooking fuel in the country,” he said.
