Organisers of the annual Asoju Oba Molade Okoya-Thomas Table Tennis Cup at the weekend revealed that the 2020 edition of the competition will hold from November 30 to December 1 at the Molade Okoya-Thomas Hall of Teslim Balogun Stadium. The organisers also disclosed that the 52nd edition of Nigeria’s oldest sporting competition would be organised in line with the COVID-19 protocol laid down by the Lagos State Sports Commission (LSSC). A member of the organising committee, Ayodeji Okoya-Thomas, being the sixth edition without the initiator, who passed on after the 46th edition in 2014, the tournament would be limited to two events this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. “We have decided to organise this year’s tournament to ensure it continues uninterrupted. We will observe the laid-down COVID-19 protocol for all participants and guests during the competition. “As usual, we will reward outstanding players and we believe this competition will also help to prepare Lagos State athletes for the forthcoming National Sports Festival in Edo State,” he said. David Fayele and Bose Odusanya are expected to defend their titles again this year having retained it in 2019. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
