The District 9110 Governor, Rotary International, Bola Oyebade, has said his tenure is committed to delivering a state-of-the-art prostate cancer centre for the benefit of Lagos and Ogun state citizens.
 
This is in addition to the free prostate cancer screening targeted at over 2,000 men, and disbursement of N50, 000 empowerment fund to community members within the district. He made this known in a media chat ahead of his investiture tomorrow at Haven Event Centre, Ikeja GRA, Lagos.
 
“We want to screen about 2,000 men that are above 40 years for free. As of today, after spending about four months in office, we have screened over 700, with 1,300 left to go.  At the ground-breaking ceremony of the centre, Ogun State governor who was represented by his deputy, Mrs. Noimot Salako-Oyedele, said the initiative was in line with the agenda of the state to step up secondary and tertiary health centres, adding that the centre would complement the state’s effort to maximize the output of the teaching hospital.
