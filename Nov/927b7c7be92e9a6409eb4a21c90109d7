CACOVID is a coalition formed by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), in collaboration with the bankers’ committee and the private sector, led by Aliko Dangote Foundation and Access Bank. The group also resolved to fully rebuild the 44 police stations that were damaged during the EndSARS protest that took place in several parts of the country last month. CBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele, while speaking in the company of President, Dangote Group, Alhaji Aliko Dangote; Chairman, United Bank for Africa (UBA), Tony Elumelu; and the Chief Executive Officer, Access Bank, Herbert Wigwe, said the decision was part of the group’s contributions towards modernising the NPF and strengthening the nation’s security apparatus. He said the Bankers Committee and critical stakeholders under the aegis of the CACOVID had held series of meetings towards supporting the government’s effort in rebuilding confidence in the nation’s economy. In addition, Emefiele said over N150 billion is expected to be deployed towards the setup and implementation of the youth development program, which will be available at selected training centres across the country. He pointed out that the CBN’s preliminary analysis indicates that unemployment, particularly amongst the youth, was a critical factor behind the #EndSARS unrest. As a result, he said CACOVID has committed to creating a high impact youth development programme that will provide technical and vocational education to over four million Nigerian youths over the next five years. Alhaji Dangote said the group has concluded plans to roll out a N25 million empowerment programme for four million youths in Nigeria.
