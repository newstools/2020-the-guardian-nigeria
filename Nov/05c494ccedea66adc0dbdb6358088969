The National Youth Council of Nigeria (NYCN) has condemned the delay in the payment of fees of Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) scholars in the United Kingdom (UK). NYCN President, Solomon Adodo, assured that it would leave no stone unturned in ensuring immediate payment of fees of the affected students. The Guardian recalled that about 30 protesting scholars were part of the 94 students absorbed into the scheme in 2018. It argued that despite the swift action taken by the Presidency and Minister of Niger Delta Affairs in ensuring that the outstanding fees were paid, but faulted the blockage of the Nigeria House in London by the scholars over the unpaid fees It, therefore, advised the students to focus on their studies and be good ambassadors of the country, while assuring that the interest of the Nigerian youths would always be protected anywhere in the world. The Interim Management Committee (IMC) of the NDDC had assured beneficiaries of the scholarship programme that their outstanding claims would be paid within a week, for which funds were released this week. But the commission said some unforeseen circumstances, including the chaos that trailed the #EndSARS protests, caused a delay in the speedy implementation of the payment plan.
