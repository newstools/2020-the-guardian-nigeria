The Katsina State Government says it would construct no fewer than 360 health clinics in the 34 local government areas, to promote efficient, effective and wider health care delivery in the state. Gov. Aminu Masari made the disclosure in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Monday in Daura. Masari said the project would be executed in collaboration with the Islamic Development Bank, adding that negotiations and processes toward actualising the project had commenced. He noted that the purpose of the health clinics was to provide affordable health care services, especially in rural communities. According to him, the state government will not relent in the provision of qualitative health care services to the people. Masari said the government would provide sufficient drugs and modern equipment in all its medical facilities, to ensure quality service delivery. The governor assured that the employment and deployment of qualified medical personnel to public health facilities would be sustained by the government. Masari said the state government had renovated the general hospitals in Katsina, Malumfashi, Funtua, Dutsinma and Daura, and equipped them with beds, laboratory reagents, and other complimentary materials. NAN reports that the Masari-led administration had recruited no fewer than 256 qualified medical doctors, and deployed them across existing medical facilities in the state.
