Analysts predict mixed performance for equities this year
Buying interest in the shares of some bluechip stocks drove the local bourse northward for four consecutive days last week, sustaining the positive trend since the beginning of the week. Consequently, the All-Share Index and market capitalisation of the stock market appreciated by 2.09 per cent to close the week at 26,968.79 points and N13.019 trillion respectively. All other indices finished higher with the exception of ASeM Index, which closed flat. Analysts are of the view that the Nigerian equity market would be a mixed, but promising one this year. They believed  that fiscal and monetary policies, as well as improved earnings, would drive economic and stock market recoveries in 2020. According to them, the projection is based on market players’ expectations that economic recovery would be propelled by ongoing regulatory initiatives and the government’s reforms. The Chief Research Officer of Investdata Consulting Limited, Ambrose Omodion, said: “As we have also noted earlier, for the second consecutive year, the All-Share Index of the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) closed negative in 2019. “However, the good thing is that the market has corrected itself considerably and stocks began to resist further decline towards the end of 2019. “Also worthy of note is the trading pattern that changed as a result of the new NSE rules, among others. “It is, therefore, not out of place to expect that the market’s graph will become flat initially, before pointing northward for the good of equity investors who position in key sectors of the economy and indeed, financial services players. “We expect a mixed performance on January effect, profit-taking and position-taking as investors take advantage of low prices, ahead of economic data and portfolio managers repositioning for the New Year as the 364-day Treasury Bills rate fell to 5.2 per cent. There are, also, the changing sentiments in the hope of improved liquidity and positive economic indices. “We expect that Investors would focus on the upcoming full-year earnings season, targeting companies with strong potential to grow their dividend on the strength of their earnings capacity.” For Codros Capital Limited, “our base case for equities posits muted stock market performance for the year. “Fundamentals are not strong enough to drive a natural correction in the equities market, however, recent policy directives from the CBN might offer some respite to the domestic bourse in the absence of much needed market friendly reforms.” Last week, the market opened for four trading days as the Federal Government declared Wednesday January 1, 2020 as public holiday to mark the New Year celebrations.
