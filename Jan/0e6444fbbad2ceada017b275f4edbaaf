Former Nigeria international, Henry Nwosu, has said that playing against Cape Verde, Central African Republic and Liberia in Group C of the penultimate round of qualifying race for the 2022 FIFA World Cup holding in Qatar would not be and easy ride for the Super Eagles. Speaking with The Guardian yesterday, Nwosu said that the team must be focused and committed to earn a good result in their home and away games. The ex-U-17 national team coach pointed out that there are no more underdogs in modern days football, adding that all hands most be on deck to ensure the Super Eagles prepare well for the qualifiers. Nwosu also charged the Super Eagles to focus in winning all their games in the World Cup and Nations Cup qualifying series, stressing that complacency to pick vital points might mar the team chances of qualifying from the group. “Concentration and good preparations is the key to the success of the Super Eagles in the 2022 Qatar World Cup qualifiers,” Nwosu stated. “For me, the Eagles will not find it easy against their opponents. Nigeria has the pedigree and quality players who can give a good account of themselves in the game of football. But these days, football is all about eleven players on the pitch and the best team who takes advantage of the opponents’ mistakes wins the game. “So Super Eagles have to bear in mind that their are no pushovers in African football. Every team in Africa is working hard to be the best. Super Eagles should approach the World Cup and 2021 Nations Cup qualifier series like wounded Lions. Every game has to be approached with high level of seriousness,” he said. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
