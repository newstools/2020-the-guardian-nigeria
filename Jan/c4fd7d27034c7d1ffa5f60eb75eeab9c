To develop agricultural value chain and ensure sustainable agricultural practices, Betamark Production Company Limited, Lagos, has commenced training for Agro business experts, start-ups and people in Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) to access Agric-Business/Small and Medium Enterprises Investment Scheme (AGSMEIS) Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) loan. 
 
As part of requirements to access the loan, applicants need to be trained by a certified and accredited Entrepreneur of the Development Institute (EDI). This allows them to get certificates from the training institute, which is one of the CBN requirements for the loan.
 
The initiative is to support government’s policy for the promotion of agricultural business, as vehicle for sustainable economic development and employment generation.
 
Activities of the initiative covers businesses across the agricultural value chain, including inputs supply, production, storage, processing, logistics and marketing, among others. Betamark is one of the CBN accredited EDI, where applicants are currently undergoing training on how to get the loan.
 
The Chief Executive Officer of the institute, Mr. Duro Kuteyi, told The Guardian that the exercise is an eye-opener for applicants to know what the loan entails, how to meet the requirements needed and how to run their businesses.
 
“The loan is meant for MSME, comprising agric, manufacturing and other services, which involves those already in business and start-ups. In the start-up category, there are youths and people who want to change their businesses.”Kuteyi also called for division of labour across the agric value-chain for maximum productivity in the sector.
