In 2018, the Colombian Olympic Committee warned its athletes about the presence of Boldenone in beef. “I’m sure that’s what generated the result from the test in question,” said Farah. Canada-born Farah, 32, and fellow Colombian Juan Sebastian Cabal won the Wimbledon and US Open doubles titles last year. The pair were also runners-up at the Australian Open in 2018 and had been due to play in the ongoing Grand Slam in Melbourne until the announcement of his doping case last week. Cabal has teamed up with Jaume Munar of Spain in Australia.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
