The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has said it is currently upgrading its enforcement mechanism to apprehend and seal offices of illegal fund managers in Nigeria.
 
The Acting Director-General of SEC, Mary Uduk, speaking with journalists in Abuja, at the weekend, said apart from continuing to educate the people, the Commission will also go after the promoters of these schemes. 
   
She said: “We are stepping up our enforcement mechanisms to ensure that they are apprehended and their offices sealed off. So many of them are being prosecuted in courts; we have secured convictions for some, and we have closed down so many.
 
“We verify ownership and return monies collected by them to the owners. It’s a problem around the world, and we can tackle the problem by educating the public, telling them the right investments to make and the right places to put in their money.
