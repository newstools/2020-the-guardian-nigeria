Plans are underway by the Kwara State Government and National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP), to rehabilitate and empower victims of human trafficking who are from the state. Specifically, the Government said it is putting in place steps to profile, rescue work out modalities to return indigenes of Kwara, who are victims of human trafficking and are trapped in Lebanon and other destination countries in the Middle East. Also, NAPTIP will establish a Command in Ilorin, to enhance its operation especially in the areas of massive enlightenment, surveillance and rehabilitation of victims. Director-General of the Agency, Julie Okah-Donli, disclosed this while speaking after her meeting with the State Governor, Abdularazaq Abdulrahmah, at the Government House, Ilorin. The meeting was sequel to the hosting of the first trafficked victim that was returned to Ilorin a few days ago, and the need to take urgent step to reduce incidence of human trafficking in the State. Abdulrahmah, who was not happy with the recent development as it concerns indigenes of the State, expressed readiness to partner with
NAPTIP for comprehensive rehabilitation of the already rescued victims. The state will also carry out preventive measures such as massive enlightenment and advocacy in all parts of the state in order nip the situation in the bud. The Governor charged the Agency to release confirmed numbers of trafficked victims from the State, who are still trapped or facing exploitation in any of the Middle East destination countries with a view to putting in place effective mechanism for evacuating them. Okah-Donli,  who was represented by the Regional Director of the Agency, Mrs. Kehinde Akomolafe, also told the governor of the plan to establish Command in Ilorin and sought for the support of the Governor. Recall that the Director General of NAPTIP, had a few weeks ago, said the Agency was working toward establishing Task Force on Human trafficking in the State, as a deliberate step to curb the rising incidence in the State, especially trafficking to Middle East for sexual and labour exploitation.
