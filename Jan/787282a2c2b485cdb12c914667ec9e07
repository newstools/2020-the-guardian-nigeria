An Abuja Court of Appeal has dismissed the case filed by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) challenging the inclusion of the governorship candidate of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), Natasha Akpoti, in the November 16 election in Kogi State. Justices Stephen Adah, Emmanuel Agim and Mohammed Idris dismissed the appeal following the appellantâ€™s withdrawn of the matter. INEC had appealed against the ruling of a Federal High Court in Abuja delivered on November 7, 2019, wherein the court ordered it to restore Akpoti as SDP candidate in the election. But the electoral body appealed against the ruling.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
