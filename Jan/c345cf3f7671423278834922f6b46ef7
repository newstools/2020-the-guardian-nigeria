A university don, Professor Sulaiman Adeniyi Adekola has called for the use of science and technology to solve some of the myriad of challenges plaguing the country over the years for the benefit of the citizenry. Adekola, a chartered electrical engineer with several years of experience postulated that the use of technology can go a long way in addressing the root cause of challenges confronting Nigeria and Nigerians in the various sectors of the economy. The erudite professor stated this in Lagos at the 20th post-graduation anniversary of the University of Lagos engineering set (ULESSET) of 1999 in a paper titled “Ubiquitous 5G Wireless Revolution: Matters Arising”. Adekola, a Fellow, Academy of Science (AS) posited that since there are many breakthroughs that have been discovered by scientist across the globe, especially in the area of electrical and electronic engineering, government at all levels particularly at the centre should leverage them to meet the yearnings and aspirations of the citizenry. While outlining the various aspects of his papers, which attracted intermittent applause from the audience, the don enumerated what he called the “inherent advantages of the all-round all-embracing and all-inclusive” 5G network to its users across the globe. These include access speed, reduced latency, fastness, efficient unified platform, concentrated networks as well as personalised Internet.Also speaking, the Dean of Engineering, University of Lagos (UNILAG), Funso Falade, enjoined the engineers to do everything in their power to ensure the sustainable development of their Alma Mata in the years ahead. According to Falade, there is progress in coming together as one. “This is because unity is strength. When you lift someone up, you are also lifting those around him and God in His infinite mercy will also lift you up. Do not relent in your quest to make your Alma Mata better than what it is today,” The high point of the occasion which attracted members of the association from Nigeria and overseas was the presentation of award to some select individuals that have added value to the former students as well as the unveiling of those who would run the affairs of the association for two years. The President of ULESSET of 1999, Khalil Akinboboye, called for the support and co-operation of all members of the association to ensure that the aims and objectives they set for themselves are actualised for the benefit of those coming behind them in the engineering profession.
