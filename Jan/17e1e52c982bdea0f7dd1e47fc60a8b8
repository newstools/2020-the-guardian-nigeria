The goal was a huge talking point on Chinese social media and a trending topic on the Twitter-like Weibo, with one hashtag relating to it generating 370 million views. “Wu has now become the first Chinese player to score against Barcelona in all competitions ever,” state-run China Global Television Network (CGTN) said. The 28-year-old Wu “single-handedly revitalised Espanyol” against the Spanish champions, CGTN said. “A new chapter in history has been opened,” it added. “For Wu, it was a night that will live long in the memory.” It was his fifth league goal for Chinese-owned Espanyol since he moved to the club from Shanghai SIPG a year ago. State news agency Xinhua said that Wu’s dramatic leveller from a narrow angle “sparked a wave of praise from media and fans in China”. Wu joined in the celebrations by writing on Weibo: “Wonderful night, a new year, a good start.” China’s new coach Li Tie will be relying on the forward to help rescue the country’s hopes of reaching the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. “He is currently the only Chinese player in one of the five major football leagues,” said the former Everton midfielder in his first press conference in charge on Sunday. “I watched the game last night and this (goal) is really something that brings honour to Chinese football.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
