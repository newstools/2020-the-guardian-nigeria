An angry mob yesterday burnt to death two armed robbery suspects, who specialise in robbing Points of Sales (POS) business outlets in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State capital. They were caught, butchered and burnt by the irate mob. It was gathered that the two suspects were caught at Green Villa in Biogbolo suburb of Yenagoa while robbing a POS-enabled cash centre. Even their get-away vehicle was not spared either. The suspected robbers were said to have stormed the centre in a Lexus SUV as clients wanting to deposit money but met their waterloo after a cry for help by the POS attendant. An eyewitness said the robbers were caught by passersby, who upon hearing the call for help, apprehended the robbers in an attempt to prevent the robbery. Another eyewitness said one of the robbers wielding a gun was incapacitated by the angry mob after beating him to pulp, put them in the vehicle they brought, poured fuel and set fire on them leading to their deaths, while another source said they were reportedly killed by the mob before their bodies were dumped in their car and set ablaze. When contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Asinim Butswat, confirmed the incident and condemned the mob action. He said investigations were ongoing to unravel the circumstances that led to the incident. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
