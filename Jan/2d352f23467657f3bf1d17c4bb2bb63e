Off-takers, mostly processors of poultry products, in  Edo State are working to deliver over 60,000 birds from six farm clusters. These agripreneurs are beneficiaries of a support package provided by the Governor Godwin Obaseki-led administration and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). The off-takers are integral part of the de-risking deal with the Nigeria Incentive-Based Risk Sharing System for Agricultural Lending (NIRSAL), to ensure that farmers in the scheme are assured of ready buyers of their produce, as well as other safeguards in the value-chain. The Special Adviser to the Governor on Media and Communication Strategy, Mr. Crusoe Osagie, in a statement issued to The Guardian disclosed that the success of the scheme, as well as other agricultural projects supported by CBN in the state is as a result of the expert handling of the support programme by the state government to ensure that the intervention gets to the end-users. He said: “Edo State Government is very much concerned about protein production as a way of curbing malnutrition and other health related challenges. Much of the state’s effort is anchored on farming, forestry and food security programme. The poultry farmers were divided into six clusters and provided with a loan guaranteed by the NIRSAL. With the arrangement, the farmers are provided with vaccines, feeds and other extension services. “The off-takers are currently processing the broilers for meat and we are impressed with the output from the farmers in the agripreneur scheme. Over 6,000 birds were sent in for processing and the farmers have got their proceeds from the investment,” he added.
