Nigeriaâ€™s Supreme Court Monday suspended the governorship appeals brought before it as one of the justices fell sick shortly after the court began sitting on Monday. The seven-man panel was to hear and deliver judgment on appeals filed against Imo, Sokoto, Kano, Plateau, Bauch and Adamawa States. The problem started with managing the surging crown trooping into the courtroom. Efforts of the security officers to curtail the influx of lawyers, party members and families into the courtroom generated so much noise that the panel arose momentarily until the rowdiness was controlled. In fact, the main entrance to the courtroom was manned by two giant security dogs to scare away those who had no business in the courtroom. They eventually reconvened and the appeal filed by Abba Kabiru Yusuf of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), challenging the victory of Governor Umar Ganduje of Kano State, was mentioned. But shortly after the counsel to  Yusuf, Gboyega Awomolo (SAN) adopted his brief, urging the court to allow the appeal and counsel to the Independent National Electoral Commission, Joseph Daudu (SAN) was announcing his appearance, the CJN announced that one of his justices hearing the case was critically ill. Consequently, the CJN led other six justices out the court to their chambers to enable them to attend to the ailing justices. But after waiting for about an hour, one of the court registrars announced that hearing on all the appeals has been adjourned till Tuesday. It is not certain however which of the  Justices is sick as the identity was not disclosed. However, all pending appeals are bound to expire at the end of tomorrow, putting pressure on the panel to hear and deliver judgment on the seven appeals on Tuesday.
