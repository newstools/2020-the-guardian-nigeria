Commenting on the process, the branch President, Dairo Abidemi, said the election was done in accordance with the provisions of the Association’s Constitution Rule 6, which states that: “Each Branch shall constitute one constituency for the purpose of electing their delegates; Branch may invite Observers to attend meeting in which delegates will be elected.”
