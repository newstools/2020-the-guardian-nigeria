Lil Wayne – Funeral | Image: Young Money/XXL Mag Rapper Lil Wayne has released a new album “Funeral” four years after he first hinted about the project. Funeral is the follow-up to Wayne’s Tha Carter V, which arrived in 2018 after a years-long delay. The album was originally slated for a 2019 release. In August last year, New Orleans’ radio station Q93 asked if he’d ever drop Tha Carter VI to which Wayne responded: “I’m not sure. I wouldn’t count it out but Funeral is my next album… I’ma be dropping that by the end of the year.” Although “Funeral” was first released live on YouTube Music shortly after midnight, it was later removed and now live on streaming platforms.
