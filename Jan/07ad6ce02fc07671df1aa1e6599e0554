Former junior International, Taiwo Awoniyi, may return from his loan spell at Mainz for lack of regular football amid interest from several European clubs. Awoniyi was part of the national U-23 team that failed to qualify Nigeria for the football event in the forthcoming Tokyo 2020 Olympics in Japan. He had hoped to flourish in his new club on loan in Germany after moving last summer, but made just six appearances at Mainz. Only one of those was from the start, and Awoniyi was substituted at half-time in that game with Mainz down to 10 men away at Fortuna Dusseldorf. And he has managed just 150 minutes in total for his club this term. With Mainzâ€™s main striker, Jean-Philippe Mateta, having returned to action just before the winter break, it is anticipated that Awoniyi will find it even harder to get regular football in the second half of the campaign. Liverpool have the option to terminate the loan agreement, but will not do so unless a clear opportunity for game-time arises. They have not been short of interest, with Greek giants Olympiacos among those keen. Ligue 1 trio Montpellier, Brest and Nimes are also understood to be monitoring the situation, while Turkish outfit Besiktas and La Liga duo Leganes and Real Mallorca have also made enquiries. Liverpool intend to meet with interested parties in the coming days, but are aware that Awoniyi would ideally prefer to remain in Germany.
