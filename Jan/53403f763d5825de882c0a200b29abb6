The organised labour in Ekiti State has written Governor Kayode Fayemi to express its disenchantment and outright disapproval over what it termed ‘arbitrary sack of its members’. The unions stated that the rumour milling about the gale of sack coming, which had already hit Ekiti State University (EKSU) and Ekiti State University Teaching Hospital (EKSUTH), will blow across all government’s tertiary institutions, Ministries, Departments and Agencies. The Chairman, Trade Union Congress (TUC) Ekiti Chapter, Comrade Sola Adigun said Labour deemed the letter highly expedient, owing to insinuation that Fayemi was not aware of the mass sack in EKSU and EKSUTH. About 1,200 workers were sacked in December by the two institutions. The letter, addressed to Fayemi, was jointly signed by the Secretary, Nigeria Labour Congress, Comrade Gbenga Olowoyo, his counterpart in TUC, Comrade Taiwo Akinyemi and Joint Negotiating Council’s Scribe, Comrade Kuloogun Lawrence.The Unions claimed information at their disposal and public domain indicated that those sacked, disengaged or compulsorily retired did not follow due process.“We don’t want to believe the rumours peddling around that the state government wants to have mass disengagement of workers that have two or three more years in the public service of Ekiti State,” the Unions said.
