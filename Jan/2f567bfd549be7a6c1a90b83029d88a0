International Data Corporation (IDC), expects worldwide shipments of used smartphones, inclusive of both officially refurbished and used smartphones, to reach a total of 206.7 million units in 2019.
   
This represents an increase of 17.6 per cent over the 175.8 million units shipped in 2018. A new IDC forecast projects used smartphone shipments will reach 332.9 million units in 2023 with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.6 per cent from 2018 to 2023.
   
According to IDC, this growth can be attributed to an uptick in demand for used smartphones that offer considerable savings compared with new models. Moreover, OEMs have struggled to produce new models that strike a balance between desirable new features and a price that is seen as reasonable.   
   
Looking ahead, IDC expects the deployment of 5G networks and smartphones to impact the used market, as smartphone owners begin to trade in their 4G smartphones for the promise of high-performing 5G devices.  According to IDC’s taxonomy, a refurbished smartphone is a device that has been used and disposed of at a collection point by its owner. Once the device has been examined and classified as suitable for refurbishment, it is sent off to a facility for reconditioning and is eventually sold via a secondary market channel. 
A refurbished smartphone is not a “hand me down” or gained as the result of a person-to-person sale or trade.
