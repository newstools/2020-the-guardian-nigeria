The Iyaloja (market leader) of Oba Morufu Ojoola Market, Ejigbo, Mrs. Victoria Osayemi, has denied the claims made by a fowl seller and head of the Fowl Sellers Association in Ejigbo market, Mrs. Awawu Kemi Sanni, popularly known as Iya Lati, that the sealing of the fowls sellers section had nothing to do with the 2013 Ejigbo pepper sodomy saga. Reacting to a report published last week, Osayemi said the disagreement leading to the sealing of the fowls sellers section was due to failure to remove a table obstructing easy passage of pedestrians beside their section despite five days of grace given to them that ended on November 29, However, after the intervention of the chairman of Ejigbo Local Council Development Area (LCDA), Monsuru Obe and the Oojon of Ejigbo, Oba Morufu Ojoola, the Iyaloja said the seal order has been removed and fowl sellers are free to ply their trade at the market. “The Kabiyesi after the intervention of the council chairman immediately instructed me to notify Iya Lati to come and continue her business and she was informed same day. Her cages are still in the market, all Mrs. Awawu Sanni needs to do is to move it to her space immediately when she decides to resume and abide by market rules. “I wonder how I could have victimized a trader for an incident I was part of. I was not a member of the former market authority that was involved in the pepper saga and I don’t have a close or distant relation in the police force to intimate me with any information concerning the pepper issue,” she said. When contacted, the fowl seller said though she was informed of the decision through a third party, her cages which were thrown out of the market are still sealed and she is yet to be compensated for the loss of her fowls amounting to about 500, a figure the market leader faults, saying it is less than 30.
