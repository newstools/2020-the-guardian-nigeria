The Economic Financial Crime Commission (EFCC) said Senator Shehu Sani is being held in custody in compliance to a court order and not because he is a critic of President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration. “The EFCC has taken note of insinuations and phantom claims that the Commission is “prosecuting” Senator Shehu Sani because he is a known critic of the President Muhammadu Buhari administration,” EFCC said on Friday. “Let it be stated clearly, that Senator Shehu Sani has questions to answer as regards the alleged involvement in name-dropping, and particularly obtaining $25,000 from Alhaji Sani Dauda, the ASD Motors boss, in order to help shield him from investigations being carried out by EFCC.” EFCC dismissed claims that it was breaching Sani’s human rights but said the former lawmaker is “facing criminal investigation, and he is being detained… based on a valid court order.” “For certain people to brazenly come out to defend a suspect, who is being probed for a serious offence as the one committed by Sani shows that they are not really conversant with his offence,” EFCC said. “It is unfortunate that certain people are ready to do anything to support evil for pecuniary gains. This is quite unfortunate!” Sani was arrested on Tuesday, 31st December for allegedly using the EFCC’s boss name Ibrahim Magu to collect money from Sani Dauda, owner of ASD Motors, on the grounds that he is very close to him. The former lawmaker was also alleged to have said he could assist Dauda in influencing a case at the Supreme Court by bribing Tanko Muhammad, chief justice of Nigeria (CJN), and some other judges. The CJN subsequently denied having any connection with the former senator. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
