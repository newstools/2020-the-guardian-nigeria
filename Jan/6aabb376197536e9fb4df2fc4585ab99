Former Technical Director of the Nigeria Football Federation, Kashiwamo Laloko, has said that he couldn’t fathom why the Confederation of Africa (CAF) omitted Super Eagles midfielder, Wilfred Ndidi, from the list of Africa’s Best XI for 2019. He added that it was something unimaginable for a gifted player like Ndidi, who did well last year to be left out. The Leicester City of England player’s name was missing from the final list of the best-performed African players for last year as announced on Tuesday by CAF at a gala night held in Egypt. The CAF’s Best XI included Goalkeeper: Denis Onyango (Uganda); Defenders: Serge Aurier (Ivory Coast); Mehdi Benatia (Morocco); Eric Bailly (Ivory Coast); Kalidou Koulibaly (Senegal); Midfielders: Naby Keita (Guinea); Thomas Partey (Ghana); Riyad Mahrez (Algeria); and Forwards: Sadio Mane (Senegal); Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (Gabon); Mohamed Salah (Egypt). Speaking with The Guardian yesterday, Laloko stated that the case of Ndidi not listed among the Africa’s best 11 footballers for 2019, was solely a verdict by coaches and captains. “The case of Ndidi not getting a mention is something interesting. The thing is that he was not even mentioned at all by CAF in the list of players to be voted for. I didn’t know what happened.“Like we know, the decision of picking players for the best 11 is usually done by the captains and managers of all national teams in Africa. My summation is that most coaches and captains voted for Sadio Mane.while Coach Genort Rohr and Super Eagles captain, Ahmed Musa voted for someone else,” he stated.“Since Ndidi was improving in his game by the day, the time to reckon with him would soon come,” Laloko stated.
