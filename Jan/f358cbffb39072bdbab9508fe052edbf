Photo; PIXABAY  Rising from its Central Working Committee meeting held in Lagos, the union decried the fraudulent acts of some gaming operators who under-declare revenues generated from the gaming public and urged the National Lottery Trust Fund to aggressively collect its 20 per cent quota of all revenue generated by lottery operators in Nigeria, as enshrined in the Lottery Act. This fund the union noted can be utilised on more tangible good cause projects that will make Nigerians appreciate the positive benefits of lottery just as it is done in other countries where proceeds of gaming activities have been judiciously used to construct massive roads/bridges, built schools, provided ambulances, hospitals, security equipment’s and even stadiums amongst others. Speaking at the event, the General Secretary, Comrade Olatunji Gregory, said: “We have resolved to go tough on all gaming operators that demonstrate anti-labor tendencies like preventing their employees or agents from joining the local chapter of the union or victimizing existing members under any guise, as we have noticed that such companies are afraid of having their manipulations exposed by the union.” He further urged all Nigerians to embrace the Lottery Industry Improvement Project that the union would be launching in February 2020 and hinted that the L.I.I.P is designed to institute a paradigm shift in the minds of Nigerians about the benefits of gaming and increase healthy participation of all stakeholders.
