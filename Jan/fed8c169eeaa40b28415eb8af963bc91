Operatives of the Rapid Response Squad (RRS) have arrested seven suspects posing as local government traffic officers for allegedly extorting motorists along LASU–Igando Expressway. The suspects, who claimed they were on contract with the Ikotun-Igando Local Council Development Area (LCDA) in Alimosho Local Government Area, were arrested yesterday afternoon after receiving complaint from a victim.
 
The suspects arrested include the gang leader, Taiwo Falodun, 48; Mukaila Atanda, 48; Adedire Olaniyi, 40; Chibuzor Eze, 26; Akinseye Alex, 48; Rasak Eko, 50; and Aro Dotun, 46. The suspects had last week Thursday extorted N41,000 from the victim for not speeding on the expressway.
 
The victim, according to investigations, was heading towards Igando from LASU when the suspects, operating on ‘Keke NAPEP’ forced him to park for not speeding. He was thereafter forced to drive to their hideout on LASU–Igando Expressway. It was there his vehicle was impounded and made to pay N41,000 before the vehicle was released to him the following day.
