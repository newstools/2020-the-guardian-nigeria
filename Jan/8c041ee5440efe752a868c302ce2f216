• Blames situation for poor infrastructure development To promote transparency in governance, the Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC), has raised an alarm on the council’s financial challenges and inability to meet its day to day obligations. It claims that this is because the council receives less than N300million monthly allocations from the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) administration.
Similar to the Federation Allocation Account Committee (FAAC) meetings, where monthly allocations are shared among the Federal, states and local governments, the FCT also holds a Joint Accounts Allocation Committee (JAAC), where it shares its monthly allocations with the six area councils that make up the territory. The AMAC Chairman, Abdulahi Adamu Candido, who made the disclosure yesterday, at a news conference in Abuja, said: “In all circumstances, the FCT administration usually deducts at least 20 percent upfront from the N300million released to us to pay salaries of teachers in all the Local Education Authority (LEA) schools in the FCT before the balance is released to us. “In most cases, this has equally created problems for us, where we find it difficult to pay our staff salaries. For us to move forward therefore, we only fall back to our Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) portfolio to augment the short falls.” Candido said efforts by the Council to look inwards are already yielding fruits, as over N9billion was realised from IGR collection in the last three years. He said: “Like I said, we have no choice than to intensify our IGR collections, and that is why, today, out of the N9 billion IGR collections in the last three years, we have spent about N6 billion to augment salary payments, and the rest we spent in providing infrastructure such as roads, schools, health, education, street lights just to mention a few.” According to him, the Council has also succeeded in paying off outstanding debts of over N800million owed by the immediate administration, adding that transparency, accountability and openness will be sustained for the overall benefit of residents.On the accusation of not adhering to the Public Procurement Act in the award of contracts, Candido defended that every contract award goes through the Council’s procurement department before advertisements are put forward.
