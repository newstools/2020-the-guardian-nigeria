Nigerian students have been advised to shun crime, drugs and unwholesome activities, so as to attain loftier heights in life. Founder, Selfless Service Foundation, Chelsea Jegede, gave the advice during a one-day skills acquisition workshop themed, “The Power in Your Hands.” The seminar was attended by pupils of Aje Comprehensive Senior High School, Yaba, Lagos. The students who were taught video editing, graphics design, coding, baking, photography, modeling, tie and die fabrics, among others, were encouraged to work with their hands and be meaningfully engaged. According to Jegede, who is also the convener, “No matter how lucrative crime and drugs appears, it does not end well. You should endeavour to be creative and understand that the only way to success is hard work. The get rich-quick syndrome leads to destruction.” She said the programme was designed to sensitise youths on the need to acquire one skill or more, and discourage them from getting involved in cultism, violence and crimes. She said her team, believe that acquiring new skills will spark up the interest of young ones and empower them to live responsibly. “We also believe they can easily transfer the skills and knowledge to their friends. The overall aim is to keep them away from vices, such as drug abuse and addiction. When the youths are engaged meaningfully, the society will be free from crimes,” says Jegede.She urged government to support NGOs engaging in youth empowerment and training, saying, “we cannot do it alone, collective effort is a must.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
