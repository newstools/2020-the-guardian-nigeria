• Bad Weather Affecting Completion Of Repairs
• Nigeria’s Internet Speed Falls, Ranks 115 Globally Frustrations of subscribers, businesses, banks, and government agencies over slow Internet services failed to abate as at close of the week yesterday, as the service offerings remained epileptic.
   
Checks across all verticals showed that Internet services in the last 48 hours have been the most challenging of the last week.  A 200-level of student of the Department of Geography, Akintunde Samuel, described the experience of having to search for Internet access to complete his registration as “harrowing.” “I have never experienced this; I have been queuing at this cybercafé since morning (9:00am on Thursday) and this is 2:00pm and there is no hope that I will be attended to in the one hour, because the queue is long and the operator has been taking the router all about to find Internet connection.” A postgraduate student, Uchechi Ubaka, said she lost the opportunity to participate in a computer-based aptitude test for a job because of the near-Internet blackout experienced on Thursday and most parts of yesterday. “I couldn’t even log in, even when I did, my time ran out, because the Internet connectivity was very slow. I called the service providers and they said it was a general problem and it would soon be resolved. But my aptitude test has a time limit,” she lamented. Speaking with The Guardian, Senior Manager, External Relations in MTN, Funso Aina, said if it is about the WACS cable system, “I can tell you that the matter has been resolved. That some banks are having issues may not necessarily have a link with the system. Some of the banks have been having issues long before the submarine cable challenge came up. But, from MTN end, we have resolved the matter. You also need to know that the cable in question is an international one. So, those challenges may not be from MTN.”
   
Responding to The Guardian mail on the hitches, the President, Association of Telecommunications Companies of Nigeria (ATCON), Olusola Teniola, explained that the Internet routes traffic is on a best-effort basis and, due to this methodology, the restoration of the affected routes would take time to be registered as being available some hours well after the fixing has been done.
   
Teniola said in the recent outage, alternative routes were also impacted at the same time due to circumstances beyond control.  The country has been experiencing a near Internet blackout since Wednesday night with a huge impact on major African countries including Ghana, South Africa, Nigeria, and Cameroon. Service providers blame the disruption of Internet services to major damage to the international undersea cables. Bloomberg had announced damage to the WACS and SAT3/WACS cable systems, which connects many African countries to Europe and other parts of the world on Wednesday. According to Bloomberg, Internet services in at least 12 African countries, including Nigeria would slow down after undersea connection cables were damaged.
