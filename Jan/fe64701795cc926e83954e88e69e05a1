•As investors wealth soar N816bn in five trading days
• Analysts predict bumper returns on investment Smarting from the lull in trading activities recorded last year, the equities market has defied New Year trends, as transaction volumes continue to surge since the beginning of the year. 
   
The rise in trading volumes was also accompanied by corresponding increases in market performance indices – the All-share index, and market capitalisation.
   
For instance, the value of listed equities gained over N816billion or 5.9 per cent year-to-date (Ytd), while cumulative value of listed equities rose to N13.787trillion as at yesterday, from N12.971trillion on January 1st.
 
This is contrary to expectations of some operators that activities would be dull due to low liquidity and the usual early year uncertainties.
   
The early-year rally on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) is being driven by higher oil prices, and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) crushing rates on T-bills.  Also, analysts at Afrinvest Limited, said: “Following the recent trend in the market, we maintain our bullish outlook on the market this week.”
   
An independent investor, Amaechi Egbo, noted that local institutional investors and fund managers have realised that there is no hope in money market instruments presently.
   
“The equities market have good dividend yield. Treasury Bills for 364 days will offer about 5.2 per cent return, while stocks can generate 10 per cent yield a day, and stocks dividend yield of above 10 per cent currently are much.
   
“Banks have been paying dividend consistently, and all the maturing investment yield from OMO is coming back to equities, and the foreign investors remaining in the market are not ready to sell immediately. The market will still appreciate more than this,” he said.
   
At the close of trading, yesterday, investors wealth appreciated by whooping N471 billion, extending positive sentiment to eight successive trading sessions as investors continue to take position ahead of companies earning results. 
   
The All-Share Index (ASI) increased by 975.55 absolute points, representing a growth of 3.54 per cent to close at 28,562.48 points.
