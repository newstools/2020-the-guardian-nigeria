Oyo State Police Command Friday said it has started interrogating the two police escorts that were with Fatai ‘Oko Oloyun’ Yusuf when he was shot and killed on Eruwa-Igbo-Ora Road in Oyo State on Thursday. Some staff of the late traditional medicine practitioner are also being questioned for possible involvement in his death. “Some of the staff and his two (2) Police escorts are being questioned by a team of crack detectives from the homicide section of State Criminal Investigation Department, SCID Iyaganku, Ibadan with a view of finding and apprehending the fleeing suspects who wrecked the heinous act,” police spokesman Gbenga Fadeyi said in a statement. Fadeyi said the deceased could have been killed due to an alleged bookkeeping records fraud he detected in his Lagos office. The police spokesman said the “fraud” he found out “allegedly led to the burning/destruction of some financial/bookkeeping records.” “In addition to other possible motives, a plausible nexus is, therefore, being suspected between the fire incident and the attack on the deceased,” Fadeyi said. Oko Oloyun was reportedly travelling from Lagos to Iseyin in Oyo State, where he recently commissioned a big building for business. The police said he was hit by a bullet after a suspected assassin shot at his vehicle about 4:30 pm on Eruwa-Igbo-Ora road. The police spokesman appealed to members of the public with credible information on Oko Oloyun’s death to assist the Oyo State Police Command in its bid to detect the crime and apprehension of the offenders. He assured members of the public that the “police is on top of the situation and working with other Police formations/units to ensure that the directive of the Inspector General of Police Adamu to crack this case as quickly as possible is complied with to the letter.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
