If you are ready to take a break from relaxers and give yourself a big chop, then this is for you, especially if you really want to make an appearance or stand out in a crowd. It doesnâ€™t have to be braids, wigs or dreadlocks all the time, sometimes, you need a breath of fresh air and a change of style. Everyone knows that wearing low cut hair is a look that not just anyone can pull off nicely. Low hair cut, however, shows the real beauty of a woman. A short haircut is a perfect go-to for your natural hair, to keep a fun and fierce look, a few curls, side cuts and patterns will definitely leave heads turning. You can highlight with blonde, purple, red or any colours that gives you that boost of confidence and flair you desire. You can have a side parting style, this adds some edge to your overall look, while with popping curls, you can switch up your style as often as you want with the curly top. You can achieve the curly top with either Bantu knots out or twist outs. With intricate side patterns that are bold and expressive, this helps you deviate from the norm if you really are daring. However, remember to find out all you can about the best hair colour to use and how well it sits with your skin tone. Since your hair is right next to your face, picking the right shade can make your skin glow, make you look years younger and bring the best in your complexion.
