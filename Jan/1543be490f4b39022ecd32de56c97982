The Kaduna State Police Command has urged members of the public to discountenance reports that 30 people were killed and 100 abducted, insisting that all purported crime incidents should be verified before publication. It made this known in a statement issued by its Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Yakubu Abubakar Sabo.“The attention of the Kaduna State Police Command has been drawn to a story on Social Media captioned, “Bandit Attack: Buhari sympathises with Emir, but keeps mum on 30 People Killed, 100 Kidnapped,” and referring to the incident of January 14, 2020 on the Kaduna- Zaria Road. “The Command wishes to state that it holds sanctity of human life in high esteem and cannot underestimate such value. It, therefore, strongly debunks the story as false and misrepresentation of facts aimed at causing panic and enjoins members of the public to disregard the report as misleading.
