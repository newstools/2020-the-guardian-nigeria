A group, Yoruba Youth Socio-Cultural Association (YYSA) Worldwide, yesterday said the commencement of Operation Amotekun would bring an end to the operations of criminal elements in South-West region. In a statement by its National President, Hammed Olalekan, and made available to The Guardian in Ibadan, the group said: “Days of criminal herdsmen are numbered in South-West region. “The oncoming South-West joint security outfit, known as Amotekun, would definitely put an end to various criminalities being perpetrated by herders starting from killing, maiming, kidnapping, robbery, rape and open grazing, which had been banned in some South-West states but still being practised archaically by uncouth herdsmen who refused to change for better. “In fact, some other evil acts, such as mounting roadblocks by suspected Fulani, which had been occurring and still being experienced on Friday at Ise-Ekiti where at least three of them were arrested, would soon become a thing of the past. “It’s left for South-West governors to carry all stakeholders along and finance it adequately for the programme to be successful. “We have factions in OPC (Oodu’a People’s Congress) and Agbekoya, but the most important thing is that our governors must treat them equally. “Our local security groups should also note that the assignment could only be done successfully when they shun all forms of enmity among themselves and work with team spirit,” the statement said.
