Senior Special Assistant to the President on Niger Delta Affairs, Ita Enang, has said the temporary closure of the nation’s land borders has added value to the growth of agricultural production, insisting that it has positively impacted the economy. Enang, who disclosed this yesterday in Abuja, while fielding questions from journalists after a meeting, commended Federal Government’s measures aimed at creating food security and restoring peace, especially in the volatile areas. “Many people who have been out of jobs are now taking to rice, cassava, millet faming. So the closure has positively increased the revenue generation of the country,” he said. He, however, urged state governors, particularly those in the South-South to support the measures and take advantage of the border closure by investing more in agricultural development.
