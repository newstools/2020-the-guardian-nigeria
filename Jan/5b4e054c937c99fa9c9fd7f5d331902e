In a speech on Tuesday, US President Donald Trump castigated the “prophets of doom” and those that predicted a climate “apocalypse”, while Thunberg sat in the audience. Shortly before leaving the Swiss ski resort, Trump said he would have “loved” to have met the activist, Time magazine’s Person of the Year. Thunberg repeated her climate warnings, hammering home in her speech that it was time to “panic” because “the house is burning”, as she did the previous year in Davos.
