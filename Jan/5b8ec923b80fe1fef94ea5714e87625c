Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Farmkash, Mr. Patrick Ugwumba, has provided tips on foods for prevention of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Ugwumba at a training of food stakeholders in Lagos said more deaths due to cardiovascular disease are recorded daily of people under-70 years of age especially in developing countries. He said most cardiovascular addressing behavioural risk factors such as tobacco use, unhealthy diet and obesity, physical inactivity and harmful use of alcohol can prevent diseases. Ugwumba advocated for consumption of organic foods for healthy lifestyle and longevity.He gave some recipes on prevention of sudden death by cardiovascular diseases and said there are many things one can do to reduce chances of getting heart disease. These Ugwuma said include: control your blood pressure; keep your cholesterol and triglyceride levels under control; stay at and maintain a healthy weight; eat a healthy and natural diet; get regular exercise; limit alcohol; do not smoke; and manage stress. “To further emphasize on how to prevent sudden death from CVDs, kindly pay good attention to what ever goes into your system as food,” he said.Ugwumba maintained that gone at the days when people will take their health for granted. “As part of a healthy diet, eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, fiber-rich whole grains, fish (preferably oily fish-at least twice per week), nuts, legumes and seeds and try eating some meals without meat. Select lower fat dairy products and poultry (skinless). Limit sugar-sweetened beverages and red meat,” he said. Ugwuma said for those suffering from stroke, he advises they incorporate the following herbal regimen in their diet but must never be substituted for their regular orthodox medication and care from their doctor. He said garlic (Allium sativum) is the best anti clotting herb. It is a major herb that should be used for heart attack prevention because of its blood thinning effect and its ability to help control blood pressure and these same effects also help to prevent ischemic stroke. “Most people hate to take this special herb as a result of its offensive smell. But not to worry, we’ve been able to develop a garlic tincture that helps you to address this challenge. All you need do is to add to your beverage or hot water and you are good to go.”He advised people to go for Ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba) is widely used to treat complications of stroke, including memory and balance problems. Various scientific studies show that this herb increases blood flow to the brain. Personally, l love the fact that this herb helps reduce fragility of the capillaries, the tiny blood vessels in the body, which can help prevent hemorrhagic stroke. He added that carrot (Daucus carota) are rich in beta- carotene and other carotenoids and have been proven to help reduce stroke. I must recommend that they should eat carrots, take them as snack and add them to your fruits and vegetables and other foods. “There are so many other herbs and natural ingredients to be included in your diet. I strongly believe that working together to reduce the mortality rate caused by cardiovascular diseases in Nigeria and the world at large. He advised that people start by minding what we eat and how we eat it. “Based on the above shocking statistics and facts. Our team decided to launch a new service food and rejuvenating therapy in order to reduce the number of deaths caused by cardiovascular diseases in Nigeria.” The Agricultural Business & Health Coach disclosed that with this innovation, they are certain that the mortality rate caused by cardiovascular diseases will be reduced. “We urge any health conscious individual to subscribe to food and rejuvenating therapy, no longer news that non-communicable diseases and cancers are global problem that need to be addressed.” He recalled sadly that how he lost his mother to cancer some years ago. “We spend our fortunate. She eventually died. “Today, CVDs remain the number one killer disease world wide. Knowing fully well that a lot of people in my country are losing their lives to CVDs and other non-communicable diseases, l decided to find solution that will reduce the mortality rate. Our company produces and distributes Natural food products to people living in Nigeria and Diaspora. I saw the gap in the production and distribution of organic foods in Nigeria, and l decided to fill it. “ He added that, today, he has helped individuals gain mastery of healthy living focusing on people with cardiovascular health issues and those at risk of having non communicable diseases. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), an estimated 17.9 million people died from cardiovascular disease in 2016, representing 31 per cent of all global deaths and of these deaths, 85 per cent are due to heart attack and stroke.
