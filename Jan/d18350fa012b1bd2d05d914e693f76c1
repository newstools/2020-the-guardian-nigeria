Cashew Individuals, associations and organisations have been called upon to own farms where everything else from input to produce sale is done for them as part of efforts to promote agriculture and food security in the country through their capital investments. Commercial agriculture is now capital-intensive, and access to good farmland is becoming persistently difficult. Hence, the efforts to make land farming easier for investors are being put in place by agri-entrepreneurs. According to Dr Wale Oparinde, EZFarmig had come up with an innovation to help investors make more profit from owing land, in same line share 60-70 per cent of profits made from every produce from the farmland. Dr Oparinde said that the investors get to own the land, while the company provides farm management services that guarantees an above average return on investment, starting from 60 per cent. According to him, “We have come up with innovative ideas to disrupt the agritech space. “It is in line with this that we have just launched the Own-A-Farm package which let off more profit for the investor, while we handle the end-to-end solution from farm management to the produce sale part of the deal.” Oparinde said that crops to be grown on the land include a mix of maize, pineapple, cashew and rice, with harvest expected in at least three to six months, even as the best farm management principles would be deployed to maximise profit.
