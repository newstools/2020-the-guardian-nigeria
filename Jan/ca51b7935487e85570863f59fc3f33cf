Our determination is to ensure that many people feel the impact of economic growth and prosperity. “In particular, we are emphasising education of the girl–child. The high level of out-of-school girls or those unable to complete their schooling due to socio-economic pressures is disturbing and must be addressed. “The launch of the National Strategy to End Child Marriage 2016–2021 has been the first critical step towards increasing children’s access to quality all-round education and enhancing retention of the girl-child in our schools.”   He enjoined the ministry to continue to coordinate issues relating to the plight of Nigerian women and vulnerable citizens, assuring them of his continued support to ensure that the ministry delivers on that mandate. The President commended the ministry and other relevant government agencies for their positive contributions towards reducing the incidents of human trafficking and maternal mortality.  “I expect the ministry to maintain its lead coordinating role on these and other women’s related matters working with state governments as well as our regional and international partners,” he said. Speaking, Minister of Women Affairs, Pauline Tallen, commended the President for recognising the role of women in nation building and support for the completion of the ministry’s headquarters. She appealed to the President to appoint more women into leadership positions in his government, assuring that her ministry would double efforts to improve girl-child education, while advancing the welfare of vulnerable persons generally.
