Are you suffering from a dry, itchy scalp or simply looking to have a longer and more lustrous hair? If your scalp is unhealthy, inflamed and full of toxins, then imagine the quality of hair it will grow. We compound our hair problems even further in our quest to make it look beautiful by using hair dyes, mousse, sprays, shampoos and conditioners, which contain chemicals that harm the hair. Whatever your hair travails may be, having healthy hair is the first step towards achieving your hair goals. Here is a guide to detoxing for all hair and scalp types: <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-887067 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/A-woman-with-healthy-black-hair-Photo-Essence.jpg" alt="" width="2048" height="1365" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/A-woman-with-healthy-black-hair-Photo-Essence.jpg 2048w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/A-woman-with-healthy-black-hair-Photo-Essence-897x598.jpg 897w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/A-woman-with-healthy-black-hair-Photo-Essence-487x325.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/A-woman-with-healthy-black-hair-Photo-Essence-974x649.jpg 974w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/A-woman-with-healthy-black-hair-Photo-Essence-320x213.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/A-woman-with-healthy-black-hair-Photo-Essence-640x427.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/A-woman-with-healthy-black-hair-Photo-Essence-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px" /> Many of us are familiar with skin exfoliation.

You can start with the application of a few drops of a hydrating but non-greasy oil – such as avocado, argan or coconut around the crown and let it sink in overnight. Then apply your scalp treatment like shampoo, working it in with small circular motions and rinsing out. Another option is to try a dry scrub. To achieve this, divide your hair into four parts, apply a sulfate-free shampoo directly into dry hair for a tangle-free, thorough scrub. Spend “three to five minutes” in each zone before rinsing with water. Your diet also helps when it comes to getting a detox. Water is one of the most powerful detox ingredients as it literally flushes out toxins and harmful hormones like DHT (which is the cause of male and female pattern baldness) out of your body. Drink a lot of water to keep your body hydrated. Also, eat more fresh fruits and vegetables because
they are excellent sources of insoluble fibre, which absorbs toxins, promote speedy digestion and ‘clean’ the digestive tract (GI tract) of waste matter.
