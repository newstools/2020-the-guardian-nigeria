For months now, there have been speculations that the Esiris – Dr Sid and Simi – have called it quits. But, there were no official statements or evidence to back it up which made it look like baseless rumors. Now Simi has let the cat out of the bag, confirming what their fans feared. She announced her separation from her husband and music star, Dr Sid, also known as Sidney Esiri, today (Sunday, January 26). The couple got engaged back in 2013 and tied the knot in 2014. Also, their first child was welcomed in 2015 and the second in 2018. The editor-in-chief of Schick Magazine announced their split with a post on her Instagram while discrediting claims that accused her of domestic violence, and that their main priority now will be “focused on working together as co-parents”. So far, Dr Sid hasn’t released any statement from his end and remains silent on the issue at hand. Read her post below;  Simi Esiri’s Statement | Photo: Instagram/Simi Esiri
