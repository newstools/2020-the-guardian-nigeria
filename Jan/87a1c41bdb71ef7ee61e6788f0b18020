Mukwana said she offered her husband for KES2000 to his mistress, however, the mistress only paid KES$17 which she used to buy her children new clothes for the new year. “My husband is married to alcohol and whoring around. I told the woman who has been misleading him to send me KES2000 ($20) but she sent me KES1700 ($17) instead,” Mukwana said. “I have used all the money to buy new year clothes for my children.” Asked if there was any chance of taking her husband back, Mukwana said that there was no chance of that happening, as she doesn’t want to start the new year with the nuisance of 2019.
