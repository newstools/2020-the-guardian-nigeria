Lionel Messi played more centrally in Setien’s first game against Granada on Sunday but the Argentinian prefers to play off the right. Antoine Griezmann thrived down the middle for Atletico Madrid but offers less of a direct, physical presence than Suarez, who has scored 14 goals in 23 appearances this term. “We are considering it,” said Setien, when asked if Barca would buy another forward in January. “We are talking about that but we still have to think about it a bit more, it’s not an issue that worries me too much. “I’m worried about the match tomorrow and the match against Valencia. It’s an issue that the sports department will consider in more depth.” Barcelona face Segunda B side Ibiza on Wednesday in the Copa del Rey when Setien could rest key players, including Messi. “I have more or less planned an idea for him but I have to see what happens in training and see how we can make a competitive and balanced XI,” Setien said. Ousmane Dembele has resumed training this week after recovering from a hamstring injury and the Frenchman’s return in the coming weeks would be a major boost to the team’s attacking options. “Dembele is an important player without a doubt,” Setien said. “He’s an extraordinary player, who hasn’t had much consistency but for sure he will be an important player for the club and we are sure he will help us a lot.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
