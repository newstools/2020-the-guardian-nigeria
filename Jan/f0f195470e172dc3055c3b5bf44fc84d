Walking has been identified medically and socially as the best, least expensive and most broadly acceptable form of physical activities as it is rarely associated with any injury and easily adopted by people of all ages. With an understanding of the importance of healthy living and community bonding, the Onigbongbo Local Council Development Area (LCDA), embarked on a fitness exercise tagged: ‘Walk for life,’ which took off from Berger and ended at the Onigbongbo council secretariat, Ikeja. The exercise had a large turnout of both young and old. While the elderly merely walked within their strides to keep up with the procession, the young persons took a delight in outpacing themselves with some jogging. It was a beautiful array of white, pink and brown vests on clean jeans adorned by the fitness enthusiasts. The walk was also an occasion for the local government to celebrate one of their grassroots icon, Hon. Abiodun Faleke, who recently marked his 60th birthday. Chairman, Onigbongbo LCDA, Francis Oke, hinged the large turnout of participants for the walk as a proof of Faleke’s exemplary leadership traits, who identifies himself with the grassroots, especially the youths, many of whom have benefitted from his benevolence and empowerment through gainful employment, skills acquisition and business start-ups. Vice-Chairman, Onigbongbo LCDA, Rev. Olubunmi Oluyade, described Faleke as an exemplary and visionary leader who has touched many lives and deserved to be honoured.
