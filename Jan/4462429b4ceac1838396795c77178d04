The United States Embassy in Nigeria on Friday said claims that it denied the general overseer of Living Faith Bible Church Bishop David Oyedo visa were “manufactured”. “Be advised, the reports making the rounds about a visa being denied to Nigerian Bishop Oyedepo are false,” US Embassy tweeted on Friday. “If you have seen this manufactured item in the media, help defeat this #misinformation by communicating to everyone that it is completely false.” Media reports early Friday claimed the embassy denied the pastor visa renewal. The reports claimed that while the embassy did not give any other reason for the now fictitious visa denial, it said that Oyedepo did not qualify for visa renewal in its assessment and urged him to reapply. “David Oyedepo In anger created a scene while querying the grounds for his refusal, stressing that he had been travelling to the states as far back as 1980s and had not violated any rules or committed any crime to have warranted being denied a renewal of his visa,” one of the reports said. A national daily said its “Sources says that he (Oyedepo) immediately sent for his bodyguards to get his phones so he could make some calls, but the embassy allegedly told him he could not make calls within the area of the visa-issuing section of the embassy.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
