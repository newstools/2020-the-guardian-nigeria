Aremu, a stage play that centre on the life and times of Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, one of the most influential Nigerians alive is set to premiere in March this year. The play, written by Prof Ahmed Yerima, former Director General of the National Troupe, tells the story of Nigeria but from the life of Obasanjo, from birth to adulthood. According to the producer, Joseph Edgar, one of Nigeria’s distinctive producer, whose passion and love for theatre and stage plays has led him to produce ground breaking productions in the last few years, the campaign for Aremu has began with the search of who would play the lead role and character of Aremu in the play, which is expected to watched by over one million people across the globe. He stated that the play would premiere in March on the occasion of Chief Obasanjo’s birthday. He added that the play will take the audience from Obasanjo’s iconic birth through the struggles of his peasant upbringing to the epoch rendering of his later life, capturing the highs and lows of his life. “The story of Obasanjo must be heard because it resonates amongst all classes of Nigerians and indeed Africans. From his peasant birth through the sufferings of a prisoner of conscience up to the apogee of power and influence you will see the story of resilience, courage, principled leadership, and values that seem lost in today’s Nigeria. For me, Aremu will give us a strong basis to reconnect to our core as Nigerians as we struggle to regain our depth as a proud people,” Edgar said. From producing Loud Whispers with Alibaba, which was his first outing and Isale Eko, which was part of the Lagos at 50 celebrations to Oba Esugbayi, followed by the erotic Jude Idada scripted play, 3some and Emotan, which was the official play of the National Festival for Arts and Culture which held in Benin, Edo State, Edgar’s work are always top notched with the best characters, deeply told stories, props of creative designs and an interpretation of excellent acting skills. According to the producer, who is also referred to as the ‘Duke of Shomolu’, which is also the name of his production outfit, the play will tour four major Nigerian cities, beginning with Abeokuta, Lagos, Abuja and Port-Harcourt. From there it will touch 10 African cities before berthing in Europe and America. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
