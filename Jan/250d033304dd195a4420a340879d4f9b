Delta State House of Assembly yesterday resolved to collaborate with the State Police Command to ensuring effective crime-fighting and prevention at the grassroots level. Speaker of the House, Hon. Sheriff Oborevwori disclosed this when the newly deployed Commissioner of Police (CP) to the state, Mohammed Inuwa Hafiz visited the House. In a statement issued by his Chief Press Secretary, Dennis Otu, the Speaker commended Hafiz for being proactive in crime-fighting and prevention in all parts of the state, made possible by his experience and cordial relationship with relevant stakeholders. “I am confident that the new CP would succeed in the task of securing the state, because of his vast knowledge of crime prone areas having served at various levels in the state police command prior to his elevation to Commissioner of Police. “Members of the House have continued to be in constant touch with our constituents and happenings in our communities,” he said, pointing out that a synergy between the lawmakers and the police was needed to flush out criminals from the state. Responding, Hafiz said, “The House remains a dependable ally in successfully combating crime. My visit is to seek the collaboration of the lawmakers in making the state crime-free. He said he had held several meetings with other relevant stakeholders, including traditional rulers and community leaders since assuming duty and that he was determined to change the narrative of crime and criminal activities in the state.
The CP stressed that government alone could not ensure the security of lives and property of the citizens, maintaining that vigilante groups played a pivotal role in assisting the police to fight crimes, especially at the grassroots.
