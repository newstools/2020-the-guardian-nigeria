Transactions on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), reopened upbeat yesterday, occasioned by gains in 22 stocks, causing market capitalisation to appreciate by N48 billion. At the close of trading, Monday, the All Share Index (ASI) gained 92.04 absolute points, representing a growth of 0.31 per cent to close at 29,710.56 points. Similarly, the market capitalisation gained N48 billion to close at N15.304 trillion. The upturn was largely boosted by capital appreciation recorded in the shares of some medium and high value stocks, including Total Nigeria, MTN Nigeria, BUA Cement, Cadbury Nigeria, and NASCON Allied Industries (NASCON). On market outlook for the week, analysts at United Capital predicted that interest in Tier-one banks, especially Access Bank that recently got Central bank of Nigeria (CBN) approval for an expansion into Kenya, and other major countries would sustain growth momentum in the market. “Additionally, the demand for dividend-paying stocks ahead of full-year results should continue to drive demand.” Afrinvest Limited also expected gains in the local bourse to persist; however, they noted that there is a possibility for investors to take profit in the near term. Market breadth closed positive, 22 stocks posted gains while 12 declined. Law Union and Rock Insurance recorded the highest price gain of 10 per cent to close at 55 kobo per share.
