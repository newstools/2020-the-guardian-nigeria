Nigeria Police said it has started investigating a video in which a policeman could be heard asking a passenger to hand over his debit card. “The police has commenced investigations to unravel the authenticity of the video, location of incident and identity of persons captured in the viral video where some persons in Police uniform were captured, allegedly with POS machine and demanding ATM card from a member of the public,” police said in a tweet. The police asked “members of the public with relevant information that could assist Police investigators” to contact their offices via email and via social media handles. The Twitter user who shared the video said the policeman had a Point of Sale (POS) machine with which he wanted to deduct a certain amount of money from the passenger’s account. Although the full details of the conversation between the police and the driver and passengers were not in the audio, however, the man whose ATM protested against the policeman’s request. The man was heard saying he had not seen where a police officer will demand the ATM card of a citizen. The police said the inspector-general Mohammed Adamu “condemns all acts of corruption by Public Servants, particularly Police officers and is committed to bringing to book any officer found wanting in this regard.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
