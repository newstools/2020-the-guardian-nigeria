Super Eagles goalkeeper trainer, Alloy Agu, says the team would improve more as they prepare to compete in the 2021 Nations Cup and Qatar 2022 World Cup qualifiers soon. The Super Eagles will play against Cape Verde, Central African Republic and Liberia in the 2022 World Cup qualifiers.
Agu, who noted that Super Eagles still remain a force to be reckoned with in African soccer, said that with the level of commitment and current form of the players, the team had the potentials to secure the two tickets. The erstwhile Super Eagles goalkeeper stated that the players invited to the Eagles team are hungry to excel, adding that winning all their games remains top priority for the players. Agu, however, called on football-loving Nigerians to continue supporting the Super Eagles, saying that the team needs to be in high spirit to succeed in their qualifier series this year.
 
He also commended Super Eagles coach Gernot Rohr on his effort to assemble a formidable squad that will win laurels for the country. “This year will be a great for the Super Eagles,” Agu said. “Nigerians will see a more technically disciplined Super Eagles in all departments of the team. With the level of commitment by the players, I don’t think the Super Eagles will have much difficulty in their various campaigns. “The winning spirit is always in the mind of the players. All they need is more support and prayers from Nigerians. There is abundant of talents in the team and I see them excelling against any big team. The technical crew is also in high spirit to guide the players to victories,” he said.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
