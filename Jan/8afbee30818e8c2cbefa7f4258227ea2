• Lawmakers Condemn Attack The Plateau State Police Command has disclosed that it was working out an operational strategy to put an end to all manner of cow stealing and unwarranted maiming and killing in the state. The Command’s Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Matthias Terna Tyopev told The Guardian, yesterday, in a chat on the update of Thursday’s massacre that claimed no fewer than 13 lives in Kombun village of Mangu Council of the state, would not disclose details of the strategy, saying the Police was yet to arrest any of the perpetrators. On claimed arrest of seven people on the scene of the incident by the Operation Safe Haven (OPSH), the Command spokesman said those arrested had not been handed over to the Police for interrogation and prosecution.Those killed in the attack were given a mass burial, following the necessary rites in the day, shortly after Governor Simon Bako Lalong visited the victims and told the families of the deceased never to consider running away from their ancestral homes as a result of the recent attacks in the area, saying there was the possibility of encountering different problems if they do, assuring that the security was with them and they should feel comfortable where they are. “If the governor can come to this place, I don’t see the reason why people should run away. We are already here, that means the security is here and they will remain here. “As we go back, we will continue to find out the reason for the attack and those who are responsible will be kept where they belong,” Lalong stressed. He told the people to resist the temptation to take the laws into their hands, but to support the ongoing investigation by security agencies, urging youths to disband roadblocks mounted in the area.Deputy Chairman, Senate Committee on Defence and senator representing Plateau North, Istifanus Gyang, and member representing Mangu/Bokkos Federal Constituency in the House of Representatives, Solomon Maren, urged security agencies to finish out those responsible for the killing.Gyang and Maren, in separate statements signed by their media aides, Musa Ashoms and Isah Adamu Abdullahi, condemned the gruesome killings and urged the people not to return to the dark days.
