The supreme court has affirmed the election of Taraba state governor Darius Ishaku. In a unanimous judgment delivered by Justice Ejembi Ekwo, the court held that the counsel to the All Progressives Congress (APC) admitted that the party had no candidate in the election and cannot contest in the governorship election. He said all votes for that candidate have been wasted votes and cannot be scooped from the ‘dustbin’ and given to another. “This petition is a mere academic exercise and cannot be given any value; and being an abuse of court process, it shall be and is hereby dismissed,” Justice Ekwo ruled. Justice Ekwo held that the law is clear on the issue of disqualification of a candidate. He concluded that for a petition to be valid it must fulfil all conditions of the law which he said was absent in the case.
