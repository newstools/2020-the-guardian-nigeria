There was low turnout in many schools in Rivers State as academic activities for second term resume yesterday. Some students, who arrived early to school, were seen helping to clean up the premises, while the teachers were seen in classrooms dusting desks and other teaching equipment, getting set for work. Some public school teachers explained to The Guardian that some students who travelled for the yuletide holidays were yet to return. The teachers, who craved anonymity, said starting academic work immediately would encourage other pupils to resume. However, a visit to some private schools in the Port Harcourt city and suburbs showed low turn out of teachers and students. At Ojims College, close to Mile 3 Market, the teachers were few, while students were reluctantly walking into the school premises. Meanwhile, the state government has reiterated its commitment to the provision of free and quality education. The Commissioner for Education, Prof. Kaniye Ebeku, stated this during a routine monitoring exercise of schools in the New Year. Ebeku said the welfare of students and pupils was a top priority of Governor Nyesom Wike’s administration. According to him, the government’s ‘no fees’ policy subsists, as the governor is committed to the full maintenance and financing of public schools in the state. The commissioner reiterated that all unapproved schools remain banned and their operations illegal, advising parents not to patronise them. He, however, expressed delight over the turnout of staff and students and warned against laxity and truancy of staff to work.
