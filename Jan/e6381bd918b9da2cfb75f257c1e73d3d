The Governor of Borno State, Professor Babagana Umara Zulum as emerged the Nigerian Muslim Personality of the Year 2019, going by the assessment of an Islamic newspaper, Muslim News. Zulum, a Professor of Soil and Water Engineering replaced the Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Muhammad Abubakar Saad III who won the most coveted award in 2018. The Publisher, Muslim News, Mallam Rasheed Abubakar, said Zulum’s emergence as the Nigerian Muslim Personality of the Year is not surprising going by his unique and excellence in governance exhibited since he was sworn in barely a year ago as the governor of Borno State. According to him, the governor has done pretty well in the area of security, which he sees as his number one priority and of course in the area of education, health, transportation regulations, economic and humanitarian support for citizens of different local governments within the state. “As a former Commissioner for Reconstruction, Rehabilitation and Resettlement under former Governor Ahmed Shettima, Zulum has continued his rebuilding exercise of hundreds of communities destroyed by Boko Haram and likewise, finding a safe haven for millions of citizens displaced by the attacks which has since continued albeit drastically curtailed by this current administration”. Abubakar said his medium identified Zulum’s commitment in nipping the debilitating activities of the Boko Haram insurgent group in the bud and his drive towards socio-economic development with his laudable actions and policies as factors that made him deserving of the award. “His developmental policies are well felt across the strata of the state. From civil servants to artisans to market women and even the retirees, Zulum has impacted lives within this short period of his stay in office. He came out boldly declaring that his own political philosophy does not agree with the fact that payments of salaries and gratuity are achievements to boast of”, he said. As a devout Muslim, he is a fervent believer in the power of prayers and in addition to the military’s approach to tame Boko Haram and its criminal activities, Zulum exployed the services of Muslim scholars both within Borno and Saudi Arabia to offer prayers for the state.
