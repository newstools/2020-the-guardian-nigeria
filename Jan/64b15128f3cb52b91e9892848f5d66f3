The Nigerian Association of Chamber of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture (NACCIMA) Export Group (NEG), has stressed the need for government to support cooperative societies to ease Small and Medium scale Entrepreneurs (SMEs’) access to finance to expand their businesses.
   
The group maintained that it is when the cooperative members have access to finance and expand their businesses that they can contribute to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), as more human and material resources would be needed.
   
Global Convener and Chairman, NEG, Kola Awe, who said this during the induction of the NEG Cooperative Society, in Lagos, noted that for cooperatives to thrive in Nigeria, both the Federal and state governments must review policies and laws that bother on cooperative ventures.He explained that the proposed NACCIMA Processing Plan (NPP), and Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), would boost economic growth through development of local content.  Bassey added that the Cooperative will among other, facilitate and promote education as part of its corporate social responsibility. “It is the duty of every citizen to take care of their country. So, at NEG Cooperative, 2.5 per cent is contributed to the Education Fund. And as individuals, if we find that a child is brilliant and needs assistance, we can issue scholarships.” Commenting, the Onigbogbo Area Officer of the Cooperative society, Segun Odedina, urged government to come up with grants for cooperative societies with the assurance that they would transform same into value for economic growth and development. He said, “Government should give support in all ramifications to cooperatives because most economies in the world thrive by cooperatives ventures, and they should trust cooperative societies in Nigeria because it is self generated and self sustained.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
