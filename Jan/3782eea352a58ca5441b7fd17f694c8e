The non-oil sector has been identified as the major driver of the nation’s economic growth in 2020.
 
A macroeconomic analyst at Codros Securities, Wahab Mustapha, while explaining part of the firm’s special report titled: “Nigeria in 2020: At the Cliff’s Edge,” said there was a high base in crude oil price and production level in 2019, which would affect its performance during the year.
   
Despite the corrective measures over the years, the imbalance in Nigeria’s export trade has persisted with non-oil sector accounting for just six per cent of the country’s revenue.
   
As a result, he said the sector is currently characterised by a systemic decline in the contribution of total exports to the gross domestic product (GDP). He added that figures from 2014 to 2017 have been below global average of exports-to-GDP of about 30 percent, according to World Bank data.
