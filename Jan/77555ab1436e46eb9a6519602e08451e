Nigeria’s opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Imo State chairman Charles Ezekwem has resigned. In a letter addressed to the party’s national chairman, Ezekwem said his decision to quit is based on the “prevailing circumstances” in the state chapter of the party. “In view of the prevailing circumstances within my party vis-a-vis my present standing as the State Chairman of the PDP Imo State and after due consultation with my family, and with the approval of my supporters, I hereby tender my resignation as PDP Chairman Imo State; also as a member of the party in the ward of Okigwe LGA which has been duly communicated to the Ward Chairman,” the letter read. “I thank the teaming population of PDP Imo State who thoughtfully elected me as their State Chairman, i sincerely regret all the inconveniences the party faced. I thank the party for the support they gave me and the opportunity to serve in that capacity,” the letter added. Ezekwem’s resignation comes about two weeks after Nigeria’s apex court sacked Emeka Ihedioha of the party as governor of the state and affirmed All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate, Hope Uzodinma, as the winner of the 2019 governorship election. A week after the Supreme Court judgment, nine lawmakers of the state house of assembly defected to the APC.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
