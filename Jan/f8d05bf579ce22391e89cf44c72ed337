Popularly known as Jhamal Hodari, he’s a Nigerian Urban/African-Alternative and R&b singer, songwriter, recording artiste and performer and model.

He currently has a growing fan base of 40,000 consumers on his social media platforms where he engages with his audience. According to the Delta State-born artiste, Adura, which means ‘Prayer’ in the English, was written “out of the tireless hardwork that man puts in order to make his or her dreams come true. Sometimes we succeed and other times we fail and the song not only just inspires us, but also reminds us to be prayerful in all we do and to always believe.” Adura has a mid-tempo solemn rhythm and native drum lines that obviously celebrates the rich African rhythm. “I’ve released about eight songs in the past, including, I like it, Wonderful Boi, Jara, Wawu, Na Lie, Abeg, Fimi Sile, Celebration and Ife, which are all on sound cloud,” he noted. On the Nigerian music industry, he said, “the industry has grown a lot; we have wider genres done by different artists and a wider range of new listeners. Our top artists are doing great outside the country, which makes it easier for the upcoming because they are paving the way for us, which is a very good thing.”
