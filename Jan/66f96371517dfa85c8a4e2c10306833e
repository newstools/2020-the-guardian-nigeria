Acting President of the Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN) Olamide George has declared that the federation would not allow the case of Ibrahim Gusau to derail its plans and programmes, practically the build up to the Tokyo 2020 Olympics Games. George, who accused the suspended AFN President Gusau of evading investigation, revealed in a statement to The Guardian yesterday that the Federation had finalised two concrete competitions for February as well as plans towards the Olympic qualifiers. “Gusau is evading investigation where he could have simply showed up and defended himself if he has nothing hidden,” George said. He dared the suspended President to go ahead with the threat of reporting the AFN crisis to the Confederation of Africa Athletics saying: “Let us see whether the law will still not take it course appropriately.” George continues: “If someone had taken money that does not belong to him, money that belong to the athletes of Nigeria and you are not accountable for such money and you are running away from been investigated, then the law will speak for itself. “We are public officers and we must learn to be answerable to the people. And for me, I am even tired of talking about Gusau. I have two competitions in front of me for February. I am preparing for Olympics and that is my target. These are distractions to me,” George stated. Efforts by The Guardian to speak with Gusau yesterday were unsuccessful.
