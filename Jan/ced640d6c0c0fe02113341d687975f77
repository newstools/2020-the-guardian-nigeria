Persons with Disabilities (PWDs) on Friday staged a protest at the office of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF) Boss Mustapha in Abuja. The PWDs led by the executive director of Centre for Citizens with Disabilities (CCD), David Anyaele accused Mustapha of withholding over 25million Nigerians by not implementing the disability Act that was signed into law by the President Muhammadu Buhari. Anyaele said the PWDs gave the SGF a 10minutes ultimatum to address them. He threatened that PWDS will scale through the fence to see the SGF if he fails to address them. “The Secretary to the Government of the Federation should advise the President to set up a commission for persons with disabilities, from now till the next one week we asking Boss Mustapha to set up the commission in line with the provision of the discrimination against persons with disabilities,” Anyaele said. “SGF is aware that we are coming, we are inviting him to come and explain to us why we should continue to suffer when the President has signed the act.” “Last time the SGF said he is not aware but now we are here to inform, educate and sensitise him on the provisions of the Act.” “We are not leaving here today till we see the SGF if he fails to come out in the next 10 minutes we will jump the fence, we did it in National Assembly, we did it in Presidency, we will do it here also,” Anyaele said.
