She did not cite specific examples. Leftist former prime minister Zoran Milanovic won the January 5 election and takes up the post during Croatia’s helm at the rotating EU presidency. Issues such as the European Union’s relationship with post-Brexit Britain and haggling over the bloc’s long-term budget are likely to dominate. Grabar-Kitarovic said that, with Milanovic, she hoped media reporting in her country “will calm down a bit, because he’s a male”. Analysts, however, say that Grabar-Kitarovic’s defeat owed to a poor campaign riddled with gaffes and embarrassing promises, such as one to increase monthly salaries to 8,000 euros — nearly 10 times the current average. She also invited anger and mockery when she sang at the birthday party of Zagreb’s scandal-hit mayor and promised to bring him “cakes… in prison” if he was convicted on a slew of corruption charges. The 51-year-old outgoing president denied knowledge of any corruption when she served in government as a minister. She also said she was going to take “a couple of months” to decide what to do after leaving office, expressing a preference for academia.
