A Group, the Incorporated Trustees of Human Rights Foundation, has asked the Federal High Court in Lagos to stop the proposed over 40 percent increase in electricity tariff. The group, in a suit filed before Justice Muslim Hassan, said that the 40 percent increase of the tariff would create hardship for consumers.In an affidavit deposed to by a lawyer, Theodora Ubabunik, the group said: “The implementation of the purported minor review of the Multi-Year Tariff Order will create unquantifiable hardship and damages on the Nigerian electricity consumers. “Consumers will be made to pay very high tariff, which has been increased by over 40 per cent across the board of which is currently being billed. It will amount to a great injustice to impose arbitrary electricity tariff on Nigerian electricity consumers.“Nigerians will suffer monumental loss as many people will not be able to access power or access same at very high tariff. I know that Nigerians are entitled to access public amenities like electrical power.” Joined as respondents in the suit are the Nigeria Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC), the Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE), the Nigeria Bulk Electricity Trading Company Plc and the Minister of Power.Others are Abuja, Benin, Enugu, Ikeja, Kaduna, Kano, Port Harcourt, Yola, Eko, Ibadan and Jos electricity distribution companies. However, counsel to the group, Anaje Chinedu, while arguing the ex-parte application before the court yesterday, prayed for “an order of interim injunction restraining NERC from taking any step towards the implementation of the purported minor review of the Multi-Year Tariff Order 2015 and the Remittance Order 2019” pending the hearing and determination of the motion on notice filed by the group. Justice Hassan, who declined granting the ex-parte application but ordered the parties to maintain the status quo, said: “It is hereby ordered that the status quo ante bellum shall be maintained by the parties in this suit pending the determination of the motion on notice.”The judge subsequently adjourned to January 20, 2020 for the hearing of the motion on notice.
