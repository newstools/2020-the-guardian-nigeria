That’s the only way I’m able to give my 100 percent into training,” Mirza said on Sunday. “It is a little more complicated. He sleeps in the same bed as me still, so he wakes up a couple of times a night. It’s basic things like that that you probably don’t think about when you’re not a mum. “It’s things like that. I’m really lucky. I have a lot of help. My mum is there. My parents have been a great support. There’s no way I would have done it without them.” Mirza, who won the 2016 Australian Open doubles with Martina Hingis, joins a select band of players including Serena Williams and Kim Clijsters who have returned to tennis after giving birth.

I hope that changes. “I hope that if my victory or even one match can inspire even one woman to follow her dream or heart, I would be really, really privileged.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
