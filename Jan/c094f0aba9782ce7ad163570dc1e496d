World wrestling bronze medalist, Odunayo Adekuoroye, has said that she needs to compete regularly as she intensifies her preparation for the Tokyo Olympics with a world ranking series tournament holding between January 14 and 18 in Italy. Adekuoroye, who ranks as world number two in the 57kg weight category, was able to secure her qualification for the 2020 Olympics in Japan due to a bronze medal-winning effort last year at the World Wrestling Championship in Kazakhstan. The Ondo State-born athlete has vowed not to rest on her oars until she fulfills her dream of returning from Japan with an Olympics medal. Adekuoroye, who was the most sought-after athlete at the recently launched “Adopt-an-Athlete Campaign” in Lagos organised by the Minister of Sports, Youth and Development, Dare Sunday, saw corporate bodies and individuals showing interest to adopt her before the decision of the sports ministry to settle for Halogen as the adopter for the Olympics. Speaking with The Guardian yesterday, Adekuoroye, a four-time African champion stated that due to her rustiness for lack of competition that she needed to be in Italy for the world ranking series event in order to return back to her fitness so as to keep pace with other athletes in her weight class. “I have a world ranking series tournament slated for Italy between January 14 and 18. Hopefully, I will be sponsored to the event by my adopter, the Halogen as a result of the adopt-an athlete initiative by the sports minister in Lagos recently. “I was in the United States recently for training as part of the preparation for the Olympics. After the event in Italy, I will be going for the African Championships in February where I will be defending my title. Also in March, there will be another championship in Algeria,” she said, adding that the rest programmes before the Olympics will unfold soon.
