The pupils had won awards during the National Literacy Competition, National Quiz Competition on Water and Hygiene, National Mathematics Competition, as well as Science, Creative Writing and Computer Science.“We will set aside funds for them to pay their University Education.  For the nine children that have done this state proud, we will set aside N10m for each of them. “SUBEB should liaise with the parents for special accounts to be opened for each of the victorious pupils. This is on the condition that nobody would touch the money until they gain admission into the university,” he said. Governor Wike said the pupils have made Rivers State proud, pointing out that they have a bright future ahead of them and charged them to remain focused in their commitment to educational excellence. “Do not relent. Your future is very bright and don’t allow those not interested in education to be your friends.  Don’t join cult groups. Continue to read your books,” he admonished them.He said he received the children at Government House because he wanted to give them hope and support to enable them to aspire to greater heights. “They have done well for the state. They have made us proud. If we can receive footballers, why won’t we receive those who have excelled in academics?  Chairman of Rivers State Universal Basic Education Board, Venerable Fyneface Akah said Wike’s investments in rural schools led to the emergence of outstanding students from schools in the hinterland. “Four years ago when you inaugurated SUBEB, you urged the board to develop rural schools.  We worked for the development of the schools in the rural schools and improvement of academic services. “All the children who won awards at the national competitions are rural based schools,” he stated. Akah said that the awards proved that the investments of the Wike administration have yielded positive results, adding, “Children of the UBE schools have been performing excellently.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
