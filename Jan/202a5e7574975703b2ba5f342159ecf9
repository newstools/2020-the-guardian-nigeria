The disagreement that led to the closure of Taraba Microfinance Bank yesterday took a different twist as the Federal High Court in Jalingo ordered the state Police Command to reopen all its branches. It said this should be done immediately pending the determination of the suit before the court. The state Police Command had sealed up the headquarters of the bank in Jalingo and all its branches across the state in December last year following a disagreement between the management and directors on the one hand and the state government on the other. Police Spokesman, DSP David Misal, told journalists that the closure was in compliance with an executive order from the state government. But the Managing Director of the bank and other members of the board approached the court to compel the Nigeria Police Force, Taraba State Command and others to open the bank and its branches for operations.
