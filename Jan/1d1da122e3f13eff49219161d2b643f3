The National Association of Polytechnic Students (NAPS), last week embarked on a national protest to the National Board for Technical Education (NBTE) headquarters in Kaduna over the dichotomy between Higher National Diploma (HND)/B.Sc. graduates. National President of the group, Sunday Asuku, who led the protest, stated that his leadership would not tolerate the humiliation and stigmatisation of polytechnic graduates, adding that the time is long overdue for such injustice to cease. Citing the example from the just concluded promotion examination exercise organised by the Ministry of Education (MoE) for all teachers and civil servants migrating from level 14 to 15 and above, he said HND holders were denied the privilege to write the examination alongside others. He berated the ministry for being unfair to the HND holders, adding that their flimsy excuse that they are yet to receive the circular of implementation from Head of Service was baseless.
 
Asuku charged the Executive Secretary of NBTE, Alhaji Masud Kazaure, to look into the yearnings of polytechnic students and graduates with immediate effect and resolve HND/Bsc discrepancy. The group also submitted a letter to the Head of Service through the Executive Secretary of NBTE, appealing to the body to release the implementation circular to all MDAs.
  
Kazaure, in his response, appreciated the leadership of NAPS for peacefully stating their demands, pledging to deliver their letter to the Minister of Education and Head of Service respectively. He expressed hope that they would find a lasting solution to the burning issue. 
 
He also advised polytechnic students across the country to ensure they acquire the necessary skills needed in there field of learning, noting that the sole aim of polytechnic education is to produce graduates that are practically oriented.
