Edo State Governor Godwin Obaseki has said that his government is committing N2 billion to the Edo Security Trust Fund as part of its resolve to boost the security of lives and property in the state. Obaseki stated yesterday that the fund would help strengthen security frameworks in the state ahead of the anticipated upsurge of socio-political activities in the state this year. According to him, 2020 is another election year in Edo. “We will ensure that there is peace and security during the contestation. As part of our programme to ensure sustainable security, we have earmarked N2 billion for the state’s security trust fund.” The governor added that the trust fund would also raise funds from businesses and citizens to bolster government’s ability to protect and secure them more effectively. “Despite the provocation and hostility from quarters who should be interested and support the progress of our dear state, I solemnly pledge to uphold the people’s trust and continue to stand for our collective interest. As mortals, we will come, play our part and leave, but Edo will remain. My goal at the expiration of my tenure is that Edo would have been propelled to the league of the best and most efficient sub-national entities not just in Nigeria, but also in Africa. “I want to assure you, fellow-citizens, that we will not relent on our efforts at infrastructural renewal, industrialisation, and social development programmes which we are undertaking across the state. We are committed to fixing our roads, rebuilding schools, facilitating expansion of existing businesses and ensuring a vibrant, boisterous state that we will all be proud to associate with,” he said.
