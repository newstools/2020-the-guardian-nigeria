• Says gas cylinder ownership to change by Q3
• Plans to create hall of shame for environmental offenders Ownership of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) cylinders is expected to change by the third quarter of this year, once the proposed re-certification of the cylinders commences, the Federal Government has revealed. Besides, as part of measures to increase utilisation of LPG, otherwise known as cooking gas, the Lagos State government has concluded plans to install a terminal and storage facility on the Badagry Coastline as well as deploy skid plants in strategic areas in the state.Indeed, the state hopes to increase LPG adoption from 15 per cent to 80 per cent within the next five years. Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, while speaking at the state’s executive and stakeholders’ LPG workshop in Lagos, at the weekend, represented by the State’s Head of Service, Hakeem Muri-Okunola, said efforts are underway to reduce the carbon footprint in the state by improving access to the commodity. In another development, the Lagos State Government said that it would begin a campaign tagged: #HallofFame and #WallofShame, to recognise efforts of individuals whose activities promote environmental cleanliness in the state, while naming and shaming residents who indulge in reckless waste disposal. LAWMA disclosed this yesterday following last Friday’s arrest and sentencing by a mobile court of some persons caught disposing waste in unauthorised locations in the state. In a statement signed by LAWMA’s Assistant Director, Public Affairs, Mrs. Folashade Kadiri, the authority reminded residents of Governor Sanwo-Olu’s executive order on zero-tolerance to traffic and environmental infractions.She advised Lagosians to promptly contact the authority using the toll-free line 07080601020 for complaints and relevant information.
