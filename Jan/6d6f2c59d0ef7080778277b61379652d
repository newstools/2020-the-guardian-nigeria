The former president was seen being ushered into the president’s office at about 1.45 pm. It is not known whether the meeting was at the behest of President Buhari, but the former President was again sighted chauffeur-driven out as he departed the forecourt of the State House at 2:01 pm after an encounter which lasted not more than 10minutes. Like the first time, he did not speak to newsmen. The former President had on October 10, 2019, visited the Presidential Villa, his first visit to Aso Rock in Buhari’s second term. He had arrived at the State House around 2.58 pm and met the President behind closed doors in his office around 3 pm. Jonathan, however, left the villa after a brief encounter, which lasted about 10 minutes with President Buhari. Curiously, the presidency did not give an official explanation for the visit, neither did the former President speak with State House Correspondents, who were on hand to engage him in a chat.
