DANIEL LEAL-OLIVAS / AFP Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses that are common among animals. In rare cases, they are what scientists call zoonotic, meaning they can be transmitted from animals to humans, according to the United States (US) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Most coronaviruses spread the same way other cold-causing viruses do, through infected people coughing and sneezing, by touching an infected person’s hands or face, or by touching things such as doorknobs that infected people have touched. CDC recommends standard, contact, and airborne precautions for management of hospitalized patients with known or suspected MERS-CoV infection. The CDC’s recommendations are consistent with those recommended for the coronavirus that caused severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Prevention How to protect yourself
There are currently no vaccines available to protect you against human coronavirus infection. You may be able to reduce your risk of infection by doing the following: wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds; avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands; and avoid close contact with people who are sick.

Why? Read the science behind the recommendations. Use hand sanitizer when you can’t use soap and water
You can use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available. Washing hands with soap and water is the best way to get rid of germs in most situations. If soap and water are not readily available, you can use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 per cent alcohol. You can tell if the sanitizer contains at least 60 per cent alcohol by looking at the product label. Sanitizers can quickly reduce the number of germs on hands in many situations. However,
• Sanitizers do not get rid of all types of germs.
• Hand sanitizers may not be as effective when hands are visibly dirty or greasy.
• Hand sanitizers might not remove harmful chemicals from hands like pesticides and heavy metals.
Caution! Swallowing alcohol-based hand sanitisers can cause alcohol poisoning if more than a couple of mouthfuls are swallowed. Keep it out of reach of young children and supervise their use. Learn more here. How to use hand sanitizer
