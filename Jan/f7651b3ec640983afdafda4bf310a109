At the time, he had vowed to sue the jewellery store and he has now made good his word as he filed a lawsuit against them on January 9 at the California Central District Court. The “Relationship Be Like” crooner filed charges for assault, libel and slander against Sterling Jewelers. In 2018, Nigerian singer, Davido and his crew experienced a similar incident at a perfume store in the UK during a shopping spree. The singer claimed they were wrongly accused and threatened to sue the owner of the store for racism. In a video that surfaced online, Davido and his crew are seen in an argument with the store officials as the superstar entertainer reminded them of his financial status. Davido could be heard saying: “Everyone here is a millionaire. We spent ‎£7,000 (N3.2 million) here, how much is perfume that we will steal perfume. I will sue you guys for racism.”
