The proprietress of the school, Mrs. Chiedu Esther, explained that the programme was aimed at fostering unity among the teachers and parents.She said: “The event was to enable children have fun and to mark the birth of Jesus Christ. Engaging students in extra curriculum activities help the children to know and improve their talents. It also helps them to perform better in their academic works and become shining stars in future, to enable them achieve their goals in life. “The occasion is to celebrate with them and show them love, which is one of the reasons for the season. It is not enough to encourage the students to work hard by reading their books, it is also important that they are encouraged to be the best in other areas of life. The school and parents should work together to achieve this.  Parents should invest in their children’s education, which is the only worthy legacy they can bequathe to them. They should also be careful in handling their children and avoid child abuse. “The school’s mission is to nurture the school children physically, mentally and spiritually. Emmanuel Chidiogo, a primary 5 pupil of the school said: “I feel happy and excited, because this is our first Christmas party in the school and it is exciting.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
