General Overseer of Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries (MFM) Worldwide, Dr. Daniel Olukoya, has cautioned Nigerian leaders against disobedience to God, declaring that those who disobey God in 2020 will suffer dire consequences. Speaking during its crossover night yesterday, Olukoya charged Nigerians to pray, because the year would be messy and confusing to many. In his missive tagged, “Year of Revival and New Glory,” he said, “It is a year of unbelievable answers to prayers, uncommon testimonies and a year in which many captives will be delivered from the chains binding them. “This year, many families shall climb to a new height of victories. It is a year when the saints must be sensitive to heavenly frequencies. Food supplies from the kingdom of Herod shall be cut off.”Olukoya added that 2020 is a year when prayers are needed against national restlessness, as well as political and economic confusion, urging those who love the country to fast and pray for the nation in one day of each week. Besides, General Superintendent of Deeper Life Bible Church, Pastor William Kumuyi has urged Christians to believe in God as their last hope, assuring Christians that the year 2020 would be brighter and glorious if only they believe God and His prophet. In his message tagged, “Our 2020 Vision of the First Final Solution,” Kumuyi said no one had seen God face to face, but He speaks through His servants, stressing, “This is the solution for 2020, believe in the Lord your God, nothing will uproot you, nothing will make you waver, always believe in His prophet and so shall you prosper.” Kumuyi, who charged the people to sanctify themselves, said they should do away with unbelief in 2020, love God with all their hearts and meditate on His word daily.   He also warned them of the danger of disrespecting the prophet or servant of God as Miriam in the Bible did. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
