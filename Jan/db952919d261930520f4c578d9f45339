The residence of a former Senate President, David Mark, in Otukpo town, Benue State, was yesterday gutted by fire. Eyewitnesses said the fire spread from a nearby bush bordering the fence of the ex-senate president’s residence and burnt down two ambulance vehicles as well as over 15 motorcycles parked in the premises. According to a source, the fire spread so fast when it caught some empty cartons in the compound from which some motorcycle parts were removed and assembled. It was gathered that domestic workers at the residence made frantic efforts to put out the fire without much success until the arrival of the State Fire Service in Otukpo. One of the domestic workers, who preferred anonymity, said: “We made every effort to quench the fire but the more we tried the more it continued to spread. It was when we noticed that we could not stop it from engulfing the guest house that we called in the Fire Service.” Efforts to get the reaction of any of Mark’s family members proved abortive, as none of them was available for comments. Also, the former Senate President, it was gathered, was out of town. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
