The medical expert added that no matter how clean a toilet appeared to be, it was still an unhygienic place which harbours germs. ”In as much as some toilets are very neat and tempting to stay in for long, we should not forget that it is an unsafe and unhygienic place. ”If you can check your toilet under the microscope and see the number of germs in there, I am sure you will not want to stay that long in there. ”So, it is better to play safe and try to remain healthy,” Bello said.
