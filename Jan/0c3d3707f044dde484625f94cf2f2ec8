Dr Fabian Benjamin, Head, Media and Publicity, JAMB disclosed this in a statement made available to newsmen in Abuja on Wednesday.
Benjamin said this was to avoid overcrowding of the centres. He added that the registration, however, would resume on Friday, January 17, 2020. “The Board regrets all inconveniences this decision must have caused the candidates,” he said.
