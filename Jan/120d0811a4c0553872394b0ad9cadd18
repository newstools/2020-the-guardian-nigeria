REUTERS/Eric Gaillard  According to German tabloid Bild, Audi, who have sponsored the Bavarian giants since 2002 and have been shareholders since 2011, will pay Bayern 60 million euros ($66.8 million) a season instead of the current 40 million. The duo’s previous contract ran until 2025. “For Bayern, this agreement is an important step for the coming years,” said club president Karl-Heinz Rummenigge. Last season Bayern generated 660 million euros of revenue according to consulting firm Deloitte, which ranks the five-time European champions fourth in its Money League behind Barcelona, Real Madrid and Manchester United. In June, Bayern sued BMW for between 10-20 million euros following the failure of a sponsorship deal between the club and automobile giant, which reportedly demanded that their contract with rival Audi be broken before any deal between the parties be done.
