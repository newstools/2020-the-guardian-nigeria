There were suggestions that the Sussexes could use the threat of an interview as leverage to get their way in crunch talks with the Queen at Sandringham according to Dialy Mail. After hours of talks, the Queen released a statement Monday evening saying there would be a ‘period of transition’ as Harry and Meghan carve out a new life for themselves between the UK and Canada. As reported by the Daily Mail, Meghan feels she’s been silenced and is no longer prepared to be muted. She and Harry feel the royals have been racist and sexist. However, regarding the Duke and Duchess’ decision, there was a meeting held by Prince Harry, Williams and Charles, where things were finalised. Meghan was barred from dialing in on the meeting from Vancouver. Palace officials said such an idea was rejected because no one knew for sure who else might have been listening in. An insider said: ‘This was a highly confidential family discussion, not a conference call.’ The Queen, who is desperate to chart a way out of the crisis raging through the Family ranks, has ordered courtiers to double down efforts to develop a blueprint for the Sussexes future, to be completed within days.
