The Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) yesterday in Abuja said Maiduguri and its environs in Borno State have been left in darkness over insurgents’ damages of electricity transmission networks. General Manager, Public Affairs of TCN, Ndidi Mbah said Maiduguri and its environs have also been cut off from the National Grid. Mbah disclosed that the 330kv transmission line between Maiduguri and Damaturu was badly affected, adding that the Damboa-Maiduguri 132kv transmission line has been disconnected from the grid for the same reason. “TCN has located the fault on the Maiduguri-Damaturu line and has arranged to repair the line. Consequently, bulk electricity would be restored to Maiduguri on or before January 20, 2020,” she said. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
