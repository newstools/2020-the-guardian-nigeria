• Culprits risk jail terms, fines
Peddlers of non-type approved telecoms equipment in Nigeria, have been advised to desist from such acts, or prepare to go to jail, including payment of fines. The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), which dished out this warning, yesterday, at a Sensitisation Workshop on Equipment Type Approval in Lagos, said the law empowers it to carry out type approval of all communications equipment for use in the Nigerian market.
  
In his opening remarks, the Director, Technical Standards and Network Integrity, NCC, Bako Wakil, quoting the Nigerian Communications Act 2003 Section 132 (2), said: “Licensed service or facilities providers, equipment manufacturers or suppliers shall obtain type approval certificates from the Commission in respect of their communications equipment or facilities prior to installation or sale in Nigeria.”   To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
