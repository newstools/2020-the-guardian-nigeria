Leah Sharibu’s father Nathan Sharibu has said he is unsure his daughter recently had a baby for a Boko Haram commander. Nathan was reacting to the report published on Saturday in some Nigerian newspapers that the Leah got pregnant by a Boko Haram commander who had married her and lived outside Nigeria. Ahmed Salkilda, a Nigerian journalist known to have links with the terror, also claimed Leah is now a “mother”. “Why I wonder, do we pretend that leaving Leah behind won’t result in pregnancy?” he tweeted on Sunday. “Since the terror group announced condemning her to slavery, is there any step or collective focus on preventing similar occurrences? She’s a mother, but I don’t know about the gender of the baby,” Salkida said. But Leah’s father in an interview with the Hausa Service of the Voice of America said that so far, no authorities have contacted him about Leah, so he has no information on the report he read online. Leah’s mother also shared similar fate. She, in an interview session with BBC Pidgin, said she could not confirm the news because no one had told her anything like that, she only read on the internet on Saturday. “Whether it’s true or not I have nothing to say,” she told BBC pidgin in a phone conversation. “Since the kidnapping of my daughter no government official has told us this,” she added. Leah Sharibu, who turns 17 in May, is one of the kidnapped 110 girls and one boy from the girls’ school in Dapchi, in February 2018. After negotiations with the Nigerian government, Boko Haram freed many of her schoolmates but denied her freedom because she failed to renounce her faith.
