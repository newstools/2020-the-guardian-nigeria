The Kaduna State police command has arrested a cleric, Pastor James Clement, from Nasarawa Tirkaniya in Kaduna, for faking his own kidnap and demanding N5 million ransom. Clement was arrested with his accomplice, George Otokpa, who served as negotiator between him and his family. In a statement by the command’s public relations officer, DSP Yakubu Sabo, “On January 27, at about 7:17p.m. one Pastor James Clement, aged 39 of Nasarawa Tirkaniya Kaduna and George Otokpa, of No. 23, Aleri Water, by Sarki Street, Kudandan in Chikun L.G.A, were arrested by operatives of the command’s Anti-Kidnapping Unit for allegedly conspiring and faking the kidnap of the first suspect, and demanded payment of ₦5,000,000 as ransom from his own family through text messages using the second suspect as the negotiator.” Sabo said their arrest followed a report made by two members of the family about the kidnap of their relation. He said the suspect, Clement, was tracked and arrested at his hideout where he hid himself, falsely claiming to be kidnapped. “The suspects are currently undergoing interrogation and will be charged to court on completion of investigation. The Commissioner of Police, CP Umar M.
