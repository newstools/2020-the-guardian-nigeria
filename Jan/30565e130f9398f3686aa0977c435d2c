Governors of the six southwest states of Nigeria will launch a new security outfit known as Western Nigeria Security Network (WNSN) on Thursday. The launch is scheduled to take place in Oyo State. The states, Ekiti, Ondo, Osun, Oyo, Ogun and Lagos, tagged the security network AMOTEKUN â€“ a Yoruba word for leopard. The network is expected to complement the efforts of the Nigerian Police Force in combating kidnapping, armed robbery, and other security challenges in the region. The security network agreement was reached in Ibadan, Oyo State in June 2019, at a regional security summit. The summit was a reaction to the worsening security situation in the region. In reaching the decision to put together a security outfit not completely independent of the existing security structure, the regional governments claimed they had secured a green light from President Muhammadu Buhari with inputs from the IGP to go ahead with the plan. All of the States, except Oyo State, is governed by the ruling All Progressives Congress. Oyo State governor is a member of the Peoples Democratic Party. When operational, the governors believe the regional security force would complement the efforts of the police and ensure safety in all the states of the regions, particularly in crannies where the Nigeria Police Force were not hitherto effective.
