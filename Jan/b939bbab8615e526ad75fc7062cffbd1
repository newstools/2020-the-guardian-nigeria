His bond has been set at $1,500 in which the victim in the alleged robbery is a concert promoter according to a report by TMZ. According to the victim, he had a meeting with DaBaby and his crew to pay for a gig, and the rapper believed the promoter shorted him by several thousand dollars and things went out of control. The rapper was taken to police headquarters in Miami for questioning by detectives regarding a robbery Thursday around 12:30 PM. Seven cop cars were on hand when DaBaby was cuffed. This is not the first time DaBaby will be in cuffs as last week he was arrested in Charlotte, North Carolina after he performed at the Bojanglesâ€™ Coliseum. He was cited for marijuana possession, but he claims he was targeted and claimed on social media that police harass him every time he comes to his home state. In his report, he said 15 cops swarmed his vehicle once he left the venue, searched it and found weed. CMPD has launched an Internal Affairs investigation to determine if officers followed department polices during the incident. In early 2019, the rapper was arrested for an alleged attack in November 2018. The rapper allegedly got into a fight with a man inside a Walmart, and the altercation resulted in a man getting shot and killed. DaBaby initially claimed he was threatened and was protecting himself and his kids. The rapper was convicted in June of carrying a concealed gun, a misdemeanor. He was sentenced to 12 months of unsupervised probation and 30 days in jail, but the jail sentence was suspended. With these histories, it might not be easy getting free from this battery case.
