• NULGE locks out workers from council secretariats
• Ekiti PDP sacks chairman, suspends two others The sacked Chairmen of 33 local councils and 35 local council development areas (LCDAs) in Oyo State, under aegis of Association of Local Government of Nigeria (ALGON), yesterday resumed at their various secretariats. It was gathered that Lanre Olaosegba of Ibarapa North-East LCDA, Lanlate, resumed with his councillors while Daud Suleiman Abayomi of Ogbomoso Central LCDA also resumed with his councillors. Abayomi, who was beaming with smiles, said: “The gate to the secretariat and his office were padlocked but they were broken,” adding that policemen were at the entrance and nobody stopped them. In an interview with newsmen, the Oyo State ALGON Chairman, Abass Aleshinloye, confirmed that the police assisted the chairmen in assuming duties in majority of the council secretariats. However, the Oyo State Police Command has urged all the stakeholders in the state local council crisis to be circumspect.A statement by the state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Olugbenga Fadeyi, said police were out to carry out constitutional responsibilities and endure peace in the state. Meanwhile, workers of Ibadan West Local Council Development Area (LCDA) and Ibadan North-West Local Government, both in Ibadan metropolis, were not allowed into the council secretariats yesterday. According to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), the workers were locked out following the directive by the state chapter of the Nigerian Union of Local Government Employees (NULGE) that they should stay away from duty. The entrance gate to Ibadan North-West Local Council was under lock and key, while workers were seen in groups discussing the development outside the council premises. Also, the personnel of the Nigeria Police Force and the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) were ground to prevent any breakdown of law and order. The Caretaker Chairman of Ibadan North-West Local Council, Mr. Mogaji Ajadi, said that the security men did not allow anybody to enter the council secretariat. In another development, the Ekiti State Chapter of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) yesterday sacked a loyalist of former governor, Ayodele Fayose, who was also the acting Chairman of the party in Ado-Ekiti Local Council, Mr. Dare Olomofe, for anti-party activities.
It was, however, learnt that his sack might not be unconnected with the endorsement of a chairmanship candidate and loyalist of Fayose ahead of the party’s congress in April 2, 2020. The party also said that it had equally suspended two ward chairmen for allegedly conducting elections into the ward executive positions without being given the nod to do so by the state or national secretariat of the party. According to a statement by the PDP state Publicity Secretary, Mr. Jackson Adebayo, Olomofe was appointed by the state working committee to act in the place of the chairman of the party, Mr. Akintunde Osadeyi, who was suspended earlier.
