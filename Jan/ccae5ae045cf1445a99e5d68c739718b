The Joint Health Sector Unions (JOHESU), Ekiti State Chapter, yesterday shelved the strike already scheduled to commence today (Monday) by members of staff of the Ekiti State University Teaching Hospital (EKSUTH) over the sack of over 200 workers of the hospital. JOHESU chairperson, EKSUTH Chapter, Omotola Farotimi, who announced the suspension while speaking with journalists in Ado-Ekiti yesterday, said they decided to suspend the strike owing to the resolution reached by Labour with management on Friday, January 10. She said: “We won’t be going on strike again. On Friday, the Senior Special Assistant to the Governor on Labour, Chief Yemi Esan, came to hold a meeting with us on behalf of the governor, with the management and we all came to a conclusion that everybody that was given letter would be given fair hearing by the time they would meet in February and they would give them their salary. “Some of them had been reabsorbed and we were told to go back to our duty posts with immediate effect. “They have also agreed to meet all our agitations on the welfare of members soon. We give the governor the regard for coming to our aid and for calling the meeting to hear us out. We are giving him that respect, that is why we are suspending the strike hoping that the needful would be done.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
