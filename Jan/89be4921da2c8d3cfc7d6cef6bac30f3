Lyon’s French forward Martin Terrier leaves the pitch on a stretcher after a vasovagal episode during the French L1 football match between Lyon (OL) and Toulouse (TFC) on January 26, 2020 at the Groupama stadium in Décines-Charpieu near Lyon, southeastern France. JEAN-PHILIPPE KSIAZEK / AFP Lyon’s Martin Terrier was stretchered off after suddenly collapsing in a worrying incident during Sunday’s Ligue 1 game against Toulouse. The 22-year-old lay motionless and was placed into the recovery position by concerned players from both sides before he received medical treatment on the pitch. Lyon said at half-time that Terrier “was the victim earlier of a fainting incident”. The club added he was doing “better and has regained consciousness”. France Under-21 international Terrier was replaced by Karl Toko Ekambi after the health scare midway through the first half. Toko Ekambi scored the final goal in a 3-0 victory in his first appearance for Lyon. “I am very happy with the victory but we were thinking of Martin. It’s complicated when a teammate suffers such a problem,” said Toko Ekambi.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
