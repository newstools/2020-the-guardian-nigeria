Chief Medical Director (CMD) of Sahyaya Memorial General Hospital, Kebbi State, Dr. Aminu Bunza, has called on individuals and organisations to complement government efforts in promoting healthcare in the state. In his New Year message yesterday, Bunza, who is the Permanent Secretary in the state’s Ministry of Health, described the health system as a capital institution that needs individual support to ensure the safety of lives. He explained that the state governor had upgraded the hospital, which would soon be accredited by the Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria (MDCN). The consultant dermatologist and venereologist said that if the facility was upgraded to a teaching hospital, it would take over 500 beds and would be attached to the University of Science and Technology, Aliero, and afford indigenous students opportunity to study medical sciences. The CMD, who pointed out that the hospital was receiving about 45 consultants who specialise in different medical fields, urged people to support the state government to ensure development. “We spend about N3.5 million on the consultant doctors and still need to employ more medical and non-medical personnel in the hospital for the betterment of the people,” he added. He then urged the people to be patient with the staff, as “health services is not an easy task.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
