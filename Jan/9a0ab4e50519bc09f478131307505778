The Nigerian Association of Liquefied Petroleum Gas Marketers (NALPGAM) has asked the Federal Government to put in place a regulation on filling and retailing of industrial gases. Executive Secretary of the association, Bassey Essien, gave the charge in a statement yesterday. Essien, who said that just as the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) monitors and regulates the LPG filling plants, the same should be extended to other inflammable products like acetylene and other industrial gases, warned that filling and retailing of industrial gases have to be stoutly monitored. “Regulators should beam attention on the activities of practitioners dealing in acetylene and other industrial gases so as to check these recurrent incidences. Failure to do this and the frequent misrepresentation in the media attributing acetylene explosions to cooking gas will erode consumers’ confidence in the use of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) and heighten the fear factor that cooking gas usage is unsafe,” he said.
