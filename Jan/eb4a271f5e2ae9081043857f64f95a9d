A police officer handing over the boy to his parents. Three suspects, namely Abubakar Saidu, aged 22; Danladi Abdulkarim, 30; and Abdullah Idris, 25; were at the weekend arrested by operatives of the Ogun State police command for stealing a four-year-old boy, Hammed Adeniran. The arrest of the suspects followed a complaint by the mother of the child, Nimota Adeniran, who reported at Warewa police station that she was alerted by one of her neighbours that her son was sighted with three strange men at Arepo bus-stop along Lagos-Ibadan expressway where they were waiting to board a vehicle. Upon receiving the information, she started looking for her son only to discover that he was no longer where she left him. On the strength of the report, the DPO Warewa division, Folake Afeniforo quickly mobilized a team of policemen and raced to the bus-stop where the men were said to be waiting to board vehicle. On getting there, the three men were met with the child in their possession and were promptly arrested with the help of members of the public. On interrogation, the suspects who claimed to have come from Jigawa State could not give any reasonable account as to why the child was seen with them or why they wanted to board a commercial bus with the child. The child has since been reunited with his parents while the suspects are undergoing interrogation. Meantime, the Commissioner of Police, Kenneth Ebrimson, has ordered the immediate transfer of the suspects to the state criminal investigation and intelligence department for discreet investigation and possible prosecution. The CP advised parents to always take the security and wellbeing of their children serious in order to shield them from those looking for every means to be rich.
