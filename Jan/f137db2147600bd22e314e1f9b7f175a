Nigeria’s Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo, has criticised his government for inability to live up to expectations despite all efforts it has put in place. “We are still very far from touching the majority of those who need help,” Osinbajo said in Lagos on Saturday night at an event organised by Airtel. Osinbajo said although his administration is currently “feeding about 9.5 million children” and have also “engaged about 500,000 young men and women” in its N-Power empowerment program, the administration “need far more resources – to put far more resources behind that programme.” Osinbajo recalled that in 2014, he, Mr Wale Edun and Prof. Pat Utomi met to write portions of the manifesto for the All Progressives Congress. He said they all agreed that a fundamental aspect of the party’s plans must be to create a social safety net for the people of the country. Since the inception of the administration, Nigeria’s unemployment rate has more than doubled from 10.4% in January 2016 to 23.1% in July 2018. In December 2019, World Bank predicted that Nigeria’s economy is expected to expand 2.1% in 2020 and 2021, but still falls below the nation’s 2.6% population growth rate. It said this puts Nigeria at risk of becoming home to a quarter of the world’s destitute people in a decade unless policymakers act to revive economic growth and lift employment.
