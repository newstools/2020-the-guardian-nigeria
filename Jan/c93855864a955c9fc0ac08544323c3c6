Owasanoye cautions against bribe taking during operations The Independent Corrupt Practices and other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) said it has equipped over 150 officials to embark on a systems study and review in government’s revenue generating agencies. In a statement by its Academy Head, Advocacy and External Relations Department, Sina Babasola, it disclosed that the officers and staff members from the Office of Auditor-General of the Federation (OAGF) were currently brainstorming in Keffi, Nasarawa State in preparation to commence the exercise in the next few weeks. Babasola said the review would be carried out in some revenue generating Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) including the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Nigerian Customs Service (NCS), Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) and the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA). Babasola disclosed that the essence of the nationwide systems review was to reduce huge revenue losses and leakages in government’s finances. Speaking yesterday during a four-day training programme at the Anti-Corruption Academy of Nigeria (ACAN) Keffi, Chairman of ICPC, Prof. Bolaji Owasanoye, disclosed that there was ongoing recovery of looted funds and prosecution of indicted public officers. “The next phase will be a review of agencies that generate huge revenues. There are a lot of revenue leakages in some of these agencies and therefore, one will most certainly indict them for infractions in high volumes,” he said.He disclosed that the collaboration between ICPC and OAGF in the first phase of the exercise led to the blocking of huge government resources that were at the verge of being looted or misappropriated. Owasanoye cautioned the officials against bribe taking during the exercise, saying, “They would certainly attempt to induce you as they have a lot of resources to play with. “You have not given us any cause in the past to doubt your resolve to always say no. I am convinced that you will continue to say no, but this is not to say that I will not be watching.” Speaking, AGF, Anthony Ayine, lamented the challenge of corruption in Nigeria, stressing the need for synergy among government agencies to reduce corruption in the country. “It is, therefore, clear that we can only curb corruption effectively by building partnerships, working together, strengthening collaborations and being united to fight graft, because it cannot be defeated by one institution,” he said. Responding, ICPC board member, Abdullahi Maikano Saidu, explained that the purpose of the training was to equip the participants to effectively carry out the mandate of the commission as enshrined in section 6 (b-d) of the ICPC Act 2000.
