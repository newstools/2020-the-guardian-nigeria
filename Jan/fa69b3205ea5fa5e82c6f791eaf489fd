In a recent cover story interview with Variety magazine, the “Shake It Off” singer spoke about her new project, her ongoing beef with Kanye West and Scooter Braun, her political beliefs and the condition of her mother’s health who was going through treatment when “they found a brain tumor.” “And the symptoms of what a person goes through when they have a brain tumor is nothing like what we’ve ever been through with her cancer before. So it’s just been a really hard time for us as a family.” Swift also disclosed that she would cut back her time on her tour to stay close to her mother. She would normally spend nine months in the year after an album release on the road, she plans to limit herself to four stadium dates in America and a trip around the festival circuit in Europe. “I wanted to be able to perform in places that I hadn’t performed in as much, and to do things I hadn’t done before, like Glastonbury,” she said. “But I also wanted to be able to work as much as I can handle right now, with everything that’s going on at home. And I wanted to figure out a way that I could do both those things.” Swift has often spoken about her mother’s health over the years. She even sang about it in “Soon You’ll Get Better” from her 2019 album Lover. “Everyone loves their mom; everyone’s got an important mom,” she told Variety. “But for me, she’s really the guiding force. Almost every decision I make, I talk to her about it first. So obviously it was a really big deal to ever speak about her illness.”
