Members of Nigeria’s House of Representatives on Wednesday asked the country’s service chiefs to resign over persistent insecurity. The lawmakers in their different contributions to the debate on insecurity across Nigeria lamented at the uncertainty of security of lives and properties in the country during Wednesday’s plenary. Chairman of House of Representatives committee on defence Jimi Benson bemoaned how long it’s taking for the Nigerian Army, Nigeria Police and other agencies to vanquish the insurgents. Benson invited the service chiefs to brief the committee on the progress on security. Another lawmaker Abubakar Fulata termed the war against insecurity nationwide as a money-making venture for a powerful set. “It seems to be a cash cow for powerful individuals considering the fact that the war has raged on for more than 7 years,” Fulata said. He and other lawmakers called for the replacement of armed personnel in the different parts of the country.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
