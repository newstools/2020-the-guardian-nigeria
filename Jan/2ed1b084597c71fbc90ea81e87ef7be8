• To draft players into American college
United States-based former captain of Enugu Rangers FC, Ikechukwu Ofoje has began a scouting exercise for talented soccer players at Saint Finbarrs College, Lagos with an intention of drafting them into the American College system where he operates as a top head soccer coach. He is collaborating with the Ogedegbe Football Academy, an outfit founded by ex-international Nathaniel Ogedegbe. Ofoje conducted a rigorous screening exercise for more than 60 players drawn from various secondary schools in Lagos. Ofoje and Ogedegbe went to America universities some years ago on scholarship based on their soccer abilities and academic brilliances. Now, they are in the forefront of providing the same opportunities to talented Nigerian football kids who are also sound academically. According to them, the scouting mission conducted by Ofoje, a soccer coach in an American University, was their way of giving back to the society that shaped them. Ofoje took his time to watch the players showcase their talents on the pitch. Speaking with journalists, Ofoje said he was impressed with the performance of the players saying: “There is the need for them to play with more intensity, purpose and drive. They also need to study. “The players must concentrate on their academics because they will rely more on it later in their life when they must have stopped playing soccer. You have to go to school even if you want to pursue a career in soccer. On his part, Ogedegbe, a Structural Engineer in the United States, urged the players to strive for academic excellence even as they pursue stardom through soccer. “Having quality education is what will keep you going on for years when football leaves you because football is just for a time and from experience, not everyone will make it in football. Your education will stand you out and make way for you in the future.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
