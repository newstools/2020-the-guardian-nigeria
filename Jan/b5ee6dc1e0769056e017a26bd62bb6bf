Kelly. In a report by TMZ, she feels she was brainwashed, manipulated and mistreated by Kelly. Azriel and her family are searching for qualified counselors and therapists, so she can begin healing mentally. The 22-year-old spoke about her new perspective on Friday when she said: “I never thought me and victim would ever be in the same sentence because I was too in denial.. but once you realize, you realize.” However, she is afraid of the legal ramifications because she’s lied to law enforcement several times in the past., and signed an NDA with Kelly. This comes after Azriel and Kelly’s other GF, Joycelyn Savage, had an altercation in Kelly’s Trump Tower condo that resulted in Joycelyn being charged with battery. Clary also alleged on video that Savage had sex with her while she was still a minor. It’s unclear if Azriel plans to take further legal action against Joycelyn. Last week Wednesday, the police were called to R.Kelly’s condo in Chicago’s Trump Tower to break up a fight between his former girlfriends, 22-year-old Azriel Clary and 23-year-old Joycelyn Savage. The fight between the women, who once sat side by side defending R. Kelly, was caught on-camera because Clary was streaming live on Instagram during the altercation. According to the footage, the incident began when Savage confronted Clary as she was removing her belongings from Kelly’s condo.
