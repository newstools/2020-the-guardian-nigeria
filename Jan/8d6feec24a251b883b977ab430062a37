Burna Boy officially started 2020 with the release of the visuals for ‘Secret’ featuring, Jeremih and  Serani. After being celebrated for its social conscious undertones, Burna’s fourth solo album, “African Giant” is given more range with the video for “Secret”, the trio scoring impressively. The video takes on a nocturnal theme that allows Burna Boy, Jeremih and Serani bask in the sensuality of steamy lyrics, visualized in even more expressive scenes while maintaining the provocative nature of the track which is equally built on heavy references. Lyrically, the song attempts to coax/cajole a seemingly unsatisfied married man’s secret lover into keeping their love affair a secret, her ambition to want to be his wife and spend more time with him nonetheless. David Camerana-shot video is set in an old vintage house with neon-soaked lights, generally depicting their “secret” getaway spot, where they unrestrictedly express their impermissible affection for each other. The video of “Secret” was shot in Los Angeles, California, USA. Press Play!
