The decision is part of a wide-ranging exercise of summary jurisdiction by the LMC in the aftermath of the fans disturbance that ensued after the MatchDay 15 fixture between the two clubs. As part of steps to put an end to the unhealthy rivalry, the LMC has also elected to supervise meetings and engagements between Katsina United and Kano Pillars Management and their respective supporters clubs’ leadership to discuss the persistent rivalry between the two clubs fans with the objective to curtailing any future occurrences of breaches and ensure peaceful engagement between the two clubs. And to preserve the health of furniture at the Muhammadu Dikko Stadium,  Kano Pillars and Katsina United are to share the cost of the replacement of the damaged seats and glass windows at the stadium upon validation of the fair cost of repairs by the LMC. While imposing some financial sanctions on both clubs in accordance with the NPFL Framework and Rules, the LMC said it may impose further deterrent measures on both clubs if the final Police investigations report warrants such move. The LMC said considering the findings and in the exercise of its powers of summary jurisdiction pursuant to Rule C23 – C26, Katsina United were fined a total of N3.5m and an order to play subsequent home matches behind closed doors pending completion of the investigation while Kano Pillars were fined N1.2m. Supporters of both clubs were found culpable in the inappropriate and aggressive incidents that attended the match and the LMC noted the incidents happened outside the stadium beyond the jurisdiction of the match stewards.
