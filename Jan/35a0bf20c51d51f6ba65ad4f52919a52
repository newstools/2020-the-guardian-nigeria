The Nigerian government Tuesday reversed the suspension of Mrs Damilola Ogunbiyi from her role as Managing Director of Rural Electrification Agency. “President @MBuhari has directed that the suspension of Mrs Damilola Ogunbiyi from her role as Managing Director of @realREANigeria, be reversed,” Nigerian government tweeted on Tuesday. This comes weeks after she was indefinitely suspended by Minister of Power Sale Mamman. The minister also ordered an investigation into alleged infractions by the agency under her. But after her suspension, she tendered her resignation and took up a job as the UN special representative for sustainable energy and CEO of Sustainable Energy for All (SEforAll). Hence, the Nigerian government said her resignation has been accepted following the reversal of her suspension. The president was, however, silent about the alleged infractions she was accused of by Mamman. Ogunbiyi as REA MD is said to be responsible for negotiating within 18 months the Nigerian electrification project, which is a $550m facility (World Bank USD 350m and AfDB USD 200m) to rapidly construct solar mini-grids and deploy solar home systems across Nigeria. She was also said to be responsible for the Energising Education Programme which will provide uninterrupted electricity to 37 federal universities and seven teaching hospitals through off-grid captive power.
