A Behavioural Economist, Mr. Ibukunoluwa Akinrinde, has advised successive administrations in the country to learn from past policies and programmes of their predecessors to stimulate economic growth and reduce unemployment. According to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), Akinrinde of the Nigeria Economic Summit Group (NESG) gave the advice yesterday while delivering the 2020 Founders’ Day Lecture of Caleb University, Imota, Lagos State. He advocated the restructuring of fundamental workings of the economy with a primal focus on enhancing existing Small and Medium Enterprises and promoting the creation of many more. The economist urged the monitoring and participation of the private sector to remove key constraints to youths’ employment. In his address, Proprietor, Caleb Group of Schools and University, Dr. Ola Adebogun, urged the members of staff to define their purpose, have the positive mental attitude and persevere to achieve more success in the New Year. Also, the Vice-Chancellor of the university, Prof. Nosa Owens-Ibie, said Caleb University had made remarkable progress since its establishment in 2007 as evident in its rising student’s enrolment and attraction of cutting-edge staff globally.
