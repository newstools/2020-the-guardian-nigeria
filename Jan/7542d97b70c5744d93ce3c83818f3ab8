Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (PENGASSAN), has called on the Federal Government to declare a state of emergency on the nation’s internal security.
   
The Association said this has become imperative as internal national security is the core responsibility of the state, and the progress and prosperity of any nation rest on peace and tranquillity.
   
The President of PENGASSAN, Ndukaku Ohaeri, who stated this recently, noted that while all efforts have been on terrorism, the incidence of kidnapping, armed robbery, stealing, cattle rustling, ethnic clashes, and cultism have greatly increased.  The workers cautioned against the increasing rate of borrowing, as its consequences lead to reduced national savings and income, higher interest payments, large tax hikes, spending cuts, and weakening ability to respond to development challenges.
   
PENGASSAN also urged the enthronement of the principle of efficiency and optimisation through competitive bidding, industry benchmarks, and effective project monitoring and evaluation, to justify every kobo spent using the Lean Production or Six Sigma Methodology. “We constantly need to juxtapose our rate of borrowing to GDP growth, future potential and opportunities based on infrastructure development.
   
“Therefore, the government needs to be mindful of the alarming debt ratio, which could affect the economic well being of the country in the long term,” oil the workers said. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
