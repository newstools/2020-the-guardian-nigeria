The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) yesterday handed over a property forfeited to the Federal Government to the National Directorate of Employment (NDE) to serve as its headquarters. The property located on Plot 1076 Cadastral Zone, Sector B 18, Gudu District, Abuja appeared in a case between the Federal Government and Emmanuel Enesi Ozigi and two others, namely: Home Vestors Concepts Ltd and Knight Consulting Ltd. On February 15, 2018, the EFCC got a judgement for the final forfeiture of the property on behalf of the Federal Government in a Federal High Court, Abuja presided over by Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu. The hand over formalities were conducted by the Secretary to EFCC, Olanikekun Olukoyede, who conveyed the commissionâ€™s excitement at handing the ill-gotten property over to an agency of the government. In his remarks, the Director-General of NDE, Dr. Nasiru Mohammed Ladan, commended the Acting Chairman of EFCC, Ibrahim Magu, for his relentless efforts in the anti-corruption fight. He expressed happiness that the NDE now has an office it could call its own, having occupied rented offices for 32 years. Though the property is yet to be completed, Ladan disclosed that arrangements had been put in place by the government towards speedy completion of work on it.
