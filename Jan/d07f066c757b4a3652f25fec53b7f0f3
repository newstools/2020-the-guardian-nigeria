Cockroach | Environmental Pest Management Valentine’s Day is around the corner and while lovebirds are already thinking up different ways to celebrate their special day, but what happens to those going through the pains of a breakup? Not to worry, Hemsley Conservation Centre has got you covered if you have an ex you are trying to get over. For just £1.50, you can name one of their cockroaches after an ex. What better way to get a revenge on your ex than naming him/her after a cockroach and the best part is that it is all for a good cause.  Through its  ‘name a cockroach programme’, you get a certificate immortalising your ex as a slimy, creepy cockroach and the money raised will go towards funding projects at the zoo. And if you include their name in the ‘add note’ section at the checkout, they will also be added to the roach board at the centre for all to see. This is not the first Valentine the centre is offering something like this as it was quite a hit last year. Following last year’s success, the centre’s website released a statement that reads: “For those that don’t quite require revenge, there’s another way to make you feel better about getting back at your ex on Valentine’s Day. “The HCC is offering the chance to name a cockroach in honour of your friend’s worthless ex-‘someone’ on this special holiday of love for just £1.50.” It doesn’t look like they’ll be short of customers, as many took to social media to voice their support for the idea. One wrote: “So I just named a cockroach after my ex, to be fed to the meerkats on Valentine’s. And honestly it’s the best £1.50 I’ve ever spent.” A second said: “I never thought I’d say this, but I am going to purchase a cockroach.”
