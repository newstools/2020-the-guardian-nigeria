The BBC reported Sporting valued the 25-year-old Fernandes at 60 million pounds ($77.97 million) while Sky Sports said the deal could see United defender Marcos Rojo move the other way. Fernandes scored two goals as Sporting beat Vitoria Setubal 3-1 on Saturday and head coach Silas was unsure if the Portugal international would be available to face Benfica on Jan. 17. “I can’t guarantee any of these things because I don’t know. Bruno is a huge player and all players like him have a lot of markets. “I don’t like to think about it, but I’ll be thinking of alternatives in case Bruno leaves. ” I hope it doesn’t happen, but we have to start thinking that,” Sky Sports quoted Silas as saying.
