Maguire will take over as skipper from Ashley Young, who is expected to complete his move to Inter Milan pending a medical on Friday. “Harry has come in and been wearing the captain’s armband and he will keep wearing it,” said Solskjaer. “He has been a leader in the group and I have not been surprised but impressed with his leadership skills.” Solskjaer cast doubt on Marcus Rashford’s hopes of shaking off a back injury for Sunday’s clash with Premier League leaders Liverpool. Rashford made a brief appearance in the midweek FA Cup win over Wolves, which may have cost him his chances of figuring at Anfield. Solskjaer said: “We’re going to give him the absolute amount of time but I am not going to hold my breath. “I would think that he probably wouldn’t be ready but he’s still got 48 hours so let’s see.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
