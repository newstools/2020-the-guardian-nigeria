A delegation of national and international partners, led by United Nations (UN) women, has presented to the Minister of Women Affairs, Dame Pauline Tallen, a detailed report of a national conference to assess lessons learnt on women’s political participation during the 2019 general elections. The UN Women’s Country Representative to Nigeria, Comfort Lamptey, who presented the report to the minister, said that the collaborative approach employed by partners and stakeholders, who supported the national conference in June 2019, was a noteworthy practice, which needed to be sustained in the lead-up to the 2023 general elections. Tallen described the presentation of the report as a historic activity, saying: “Ahead of the 2023 elections, we need to begin strategising and we must leverage on our partnership with INEC.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
