Travis Scott is ending the year, and the decade, on a high note with Jackboys, a compilation album from his Cactus Jack record label. It’s the label’s first collective release and is built around its roster of Sheck Wes, Don Toliver, Chase B, Octavian, and Scott himself. With features from Rosalía, Young Thug, and more, it’s the perfect glimpse of what Cactus Jack can do and what kind of energy that the label brings to the table. Now that the album is out, fans can finally get a chance to hear what Cactus Jack is about. The seven-track project opens with a surprise remix to Scott’s Highest in the Room that feature Rosalía and Lil Baby. It has a fitting end to an LP that’s about slotting in guests in creative places as much as it is about showcasing its eclectic blend of talent from Cactus Jack.
