The coalition was led by Mr. Alkasim Tijani, who said the groups were out to let Nigerians know that their “total support for Governor Mohammed is adamant.” He said: “We are calling on stakeholders in the Supreme Court to affirm the Appeal Court’s decision on Senator Bala Mohammed’s victory. We are very optimistic that Monday’s judgment will be another victory for us. “We have seen the laudable projects going on across the state, within the short time he has spent in the office. We know that by God’s grace, no one will be coming to interfere or distort these projects, particularly in the area of education, health, infrastructure, and human capital development. “We, therefore, call on everyone to commence massive special prayer to ensure that the Governor remains in office for the next eight years in sha Allah…”  The groups called on the Supreme Court to ensure transparency while delivering the judgment. Meanwhile, the Convener of Body of Bauchi Lawyers of Conscience (BOBALAC), a group in pro bono service for Governor Mohammed, Barrister Jibrin Jibrin has called for calm and enjoined Mohammed’s supporters to be optimistic of victory.
