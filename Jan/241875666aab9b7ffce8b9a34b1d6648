The All Progressives Congress (APC) has applauded the Court of Appeal verdict, which endorsed David Lyon as the party’s authentic candidate in the Novermber 16, 2019 Bayelsa State governorship election. The Court of Appeal had struck out the case of former Minister of State for Agriculture, Senator Heineken Lokpobiri challenging the candidacy of Lyon who eventually swept the poll. APC Deputy National Publicity Secretary, Yekini Nabena, who spoke to journalists shortly after the verdict, maintained that it was an affirmation that the direct primaries mode used to select Lyon was credible, transparent and reflected the wishes of the party members in the state. The party urged Bayelsa people to rally around and support the incoming administration of David Lyon. “In delivering the verdict, the Court of Appeal has sided with party members and defended their votes, which they gave Lyon to move Bayelsa State to the next level. “While Heineken Lokpobiri has a legitimate right to contest the outcome of the primaries through legal means, it is now clear through the Appeal Court ruling that Lokpobiri had no case ab initio. “I now charge all well meaning Bayelsa people to support the incoming administration of Lyon whose campaign development blueprint when implemented will deliver home grown initiative to ensure progress, peace and stability of the state and the Niger Delta,” the statement reads.
