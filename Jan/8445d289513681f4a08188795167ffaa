 Soccer Football – Africa Cup of Nations 2019 – Third Place Play Off – Tunisia v Nigeria – Al Salam Stadium, Cairo, Egypt – July 17, 2019  Nigeria coach Gernot Rohr             REUTERS/Mohamed Abd El Ghany  Ibitoye told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos that speculation being spread by uninformed individuals were fake news. NAN reports that Rohr was alleged to have been given stringent conditions for his contract renewal, which includes living in Nigeria and paying taxes and also monitoring the local leagues. The Franco-German was appointed in August 2016 on a four-year contract and has since then led the Super Eagles to the 2018 World Cup in Russia and a Third Place finish at the Egypt 2019 AFCON. Ibitoye added that the insinuations were the handiwork of mischief-makers. “All the news about Rohrs contract and conditions are fake news, some of them just sit down and concoct lies. “These generation of journalists are funny, on the Rohrs contract, the writer just sits down to write his opinion and pass it as news. There is nothing about contract talks. “There is nothing like stringent condition over Rohrs contract; what we are looking forward to now is Jan. 20, when the draw for the World Cup qualifiers will be made. “Presently, Rohr is in Madagascar on vacation with his family and after that, the work will start in earnest, all the news about him is an unnecessary distraction,’’ he said. Ibitoye said that the team was expecting to begin preparations for the World Cup qualifiers expected to take place on Jan. 20. “We should not allow distraction to affect our preparations toward the World Cup qualifiers if we allow such, Nigerians will not forgive us because football is a big relief to many. “We want to focus on the strategies to employ for the qualification matches because after the draw for the World Cup qualification in January the work will start in earnest. “We have to look out for our opponents, their strength and weaknesses, our players and where we will play our home matches. We will also know the type of field that we are playing on. “We are not praying for an easy group so that we will not be complacent, we want a group that will put us on our toes because only one team will make it to the next round,’’ he added.
