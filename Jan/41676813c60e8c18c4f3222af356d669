The ‘Star Wars’ actor responded to a lot of fans on Tuesday after a screenshot of a comment he recently left on someone’s Instagram post went viral, which shows him saying: “it’s not about who she kisses but who eventually lays the pipe. You are a genius.” This comment was in response to a fan who made light of the fact that John’s character, Finn, doesn’t get the girl at the end of ‘Rise of Skywalker.’ After his pipe joke, Boyega was attacked by some fan on twitter who did not find the joke funny, with people calling him misogynistic, sexist and bitter over Finn’s fate and the end of the franchise. He, however, has refused to be shut up, rather, he is making fun of everyone who is taking the joke too seriously. Subsequently, he suggested he was just talking about the characters in a joking manner and didn’t mean for it to translate to real life. In response to one user, he wrote, “I was talking about Rey from Star Wars. When did I speak about women in general? Where did I even mention holes? … Bye now.” John Boyega will not allow fans to bully him and we are here for it.
