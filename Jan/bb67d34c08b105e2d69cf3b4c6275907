However, puffy eyes often have you looking tired and sick. Your under-eye has susceptible skin and is one of the first places your body shows signs of stress. Eye puffiness (eyebags) is caused by several factors including allergies, stress, and lack of sleep. These factors cause fluid to pool in the under-eye area, which then leads to mild swelling. Rubbing your eyes only causes them to become inflamed. People often opt to use eye creams and medical procedures to reduce their eyebags. Still, there are home remedies that have proven to be more effective and less expensive. Here are 6 natural solutions to improving your eye bags: Sliced Potatoes:
The potatoes in your pantry have more use than being mere cooking ingredients. In fact, you might be surprised at what you could pull off using a potato. Potatoes have been proven to be a quick home remedy to eyebags. Potatoes contain “Catecholase,” an anti-inflammatory enzyme that reduces eye puffiness and dark circles from under the eyes.
All you have to do is grab a potato from your pantry and cut into four-six thick slices large enough to cover your eye area. Lie down and place one potato slice on each eye for 10 minutes. Repeat this process until you notice the eye puffiness reduces, once done, wash the area and apply coconut oil. The starch from the potato draws out toxins while the coconut oil takes away any dryness from the potato, leaving you with no eyebags. Cold Cucumber Slices
Cucumbers are the most popular home remedy for eye bags. Like ads and television programs would tell you, it’s not a relaxing s/pa treatment without cucumber slices over your eyes. This is not just a TV myth, cucumber slices are proven remedies to eye puffiness. Cucumbers are linked to collagen production, which helps to reduce puffiness over areas they are applied to, in this case, your eyes. When properly placed, chilled slices of cucumber can help de-puff your eyes with the help of its caffeic acid, which restricts blood vessels. Cucumbers also contain vitamin C to soothe irritated skin. To do this, put a cucumber in the fridge for between 5-10 minutes, once cold slice up two pieces large enough to fit your eye area. Apply these slices to your eye area and give it a few minutes to set in. Egg Whites
Eggs are not just breakfast meals, they do quite a lot in skincare. Egg whites are also a well known natural source of a skin-tightening protein called “albumin” as well as “collagen” which take care of eye bags. Whisk two egg whites (preferably from the fridge to make sure they are a bit chill) until they are smooth. Gently apply this mix to your under-eye area with your index or middle finger and leave on for 5-10 minutes. You might feel a tightening effect, but it’s nothing to worry about, once the 10 minutes is up, rinse off with lukewarm. Green Tea
Green tea has several health benefits both for your health and skin. Green tea is packed with antioxidants that combat free radicals responsible for breaking down skin cells. It also possesses anti-inflammatory properties which makes it an excellent treatment for swelling. The tea’s tannins work great as a gentle astringent, and its caffeine constricts the blood flow that causes puffiness.
To do this, soak two tea bags in ice water for several minutes and cover the under-eye area with them for 15 to 20 minutes for best results. Baking Soda
Baking soda promotes blood flow when applied to your under-eye area, reducing eye bags. It is also a natural exfoliator that makes your under-eye skin glow when applied. Mix the baking soda in water and soak cotton pads in it. Remove the excess water and place the cotton pads on your eyes for 10-15 minutes. Remove the pads and rinse your face with cold water after which pat your face dry with a clean towel and moisturise. Chilled Spoon
That teaspoon in your cabinet can come in handy for more than just eating breakfast. They also help with de-puffing eye bags.
Put two spoons in your fridge for 5-10 minutes, lie down and place the back of each spoon on your eyelid. Leave or 10 minutes, the area becomes soothed as the coldness constricts blood cells reducing swelling. While trying out these home remedies, remember that they can only provide you with temporary relief. The trick to keeping eyebags away is to stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water and getting enough rest.
