Last May, Suarez missed the last two league games and the Spanish cup final, which Barcelona lost to Valencia, so he could have an operation on his right knee and recover in time to play for Uruguay in the Copa America in Brazil. Suarez also underwent knee surgery in May 2014, returning in time to score twice against England at the end of June in the World Cup.
