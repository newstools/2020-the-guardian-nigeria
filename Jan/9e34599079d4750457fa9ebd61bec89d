The guidelines issued Thursday by the IOC on specific actions that are banned and will draw sanctions, come after two US athletes were reprimanded by the US Olympic Committee for medal podium protests at the Pan American Games in Lima. Fencer Race Imboden kneeled and hammer thrower Gwen Berry raised a fist in protest. Both received 12 months of probation. Rapinoe has been outspoken on political issues during her career, speaking out about issues including gender equality and racism. In 2016 she joined former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick in kneeling during the national anthem to protest racial inequality in America.
