The US began implementing a ban on travellers from six mostly Muslim countries, amid fresh controversy about who is exempt: those with “close family relationships” can get visas, but grandparents and grandchildren don’t count.

CLARY US President Donald Trump said his administration was preparing to add a “couple of countries” to the controversial list of states whose citizens are subject to travel bans or severe restrictions on entry to the United States. “We are adding a couple of countries to it. We have to be safe. Our country has to be safe,” he said at the World Economic Forum in Davos, adding that the names of the new countries would be announced, “very shortly”.
