 ILO Director General Guy Ryder  A former managing director of the defunct Diamond Bank turned politician, Alex Otti, in a recent piece published in Thisday Newspapers, said unemployment rate expected to increase to 33.5 per cent in the course of the year. According to him, “Youth unemployment figures are even more scary as they are estimated to be over 60 per cent. “To put it graphically, about six Nigerians drop into the poverty basket every minute. “The number of people living below poverty line is chasing 100 million and that amounts to roughly half of the population.”Otti maintained that it is a no brainer that if the economy attracts more investments, jobs would be created, productivity would increase and the economy would do a lot better. 
 
Speaking with The Guardian, a Lagos-based lawyer and expert on labour matters, Paul Omoijiade, said while there is a need to have proper legal framework, the cause of unemployment can be addressed holistically.
   
To get this right, he advised the issue of underemployment must also be addressed by tackling the trade sector. 
Also, he urged the Ministry of Labour and Employment to tackle trade-related issues and provide supervisory roles to ensure that jobless youths are gainfully employed.
   
While calling for a quick review of the labour laws, he said the notion for hire and fire should be amended, saying: “In the advanced economies, it is easier to hire than to fire; it is difficult to terminate an employee without cogent reasons.“To manage the issue of unemployment, you need to professionalise the personnel management in most institutions, because we cannot do away with the human side of the enterprise, because human beings are the only thinking asset that you have; others are dummies. To that extent, you must ensure that the skills they have acquired are not thrown away just like that,” he said.
