Davido and Peruzzi | @peruzzi_vibes Some few days ago, the Nigerian social media was set ablaze when King Patrick of Goldenboy Entertainment took to Twitter to accuse Peruzzi of a breach of contract. Patrick in a series of tweets alleged that Peruzzi is legally signed to Goldenboy but poses as a DMW artist and songs he recorded for Goldenboy are now being sung by Davido. Patrick seemingly shattered an already wobbling table when he dragged Chioma, Davido’s fiance into the conversation by alleging that she used to be sexually involved with Peruzzi but was pimped out to Davido as his (Peruzzi’s) cousin. Following the emergence of these accusations, many fans of the parties involved began to react with many urging Davido to demand a paternity test on his newly born son, Ifeanyi whom he welcomed with Chioma in December 2019. Many were of the opinion that since Chioma and Peruzzi were allegedly involved, the baby might not be Davido’s. Peruzzi has since countered Patrick’s allegations and denied being sexually involved with Chioma. Peruzzi and Davido | @peruzzi_vives If there is one thing that many have been anticipating, it is how Davido and Chioma, as well as Davido and Peruzzi’s relationships, would be affected by the allegations. It appears all is well with Davido and Peruzzi’s friendship as the “Majesty” crooner took to his Instagram page to share photos of himself and the DMW boss. In the photos, both music stars are seeing sharing a hearty laugh with Peruzzi captioning the photo “UNBREAKABLE.” The second photo sees the two stars with drinks in hand as they stare at an object behind them in obvious camaraderie. His caption is a clear reference to his alleged betrayal scandal and judging from his post, it is clear that he and Davido’s bond remains strong.
