The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) Wednesday issued the certificate of return to Imo State governor-elect Hope Uzodinma. INEC’s national commissioner May Agbamuche-Mbu presented the certificate to Uzodinma in Owerri, Imo State capital. Ifeanyi Ararume, governorship candidate of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), and Uche Nwosu, candidate of Action Alliance (AA), accompanied Uzodinma to pick the certificate of return. The Supreme court on Tuesday nullified Emeka Ihedioha’s election as governor and declared Uzodinma the legitimate winner of the governorship election. The court held that the lower court erred in law when it rejected evidence tendered before it that votes due to from 388 polling units were not credited to APC and Uzodinma.
