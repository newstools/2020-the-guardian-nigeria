As far as I am concerned, mentally, I am almost out of Lagos and want to focus on Kano, Kaduna, Ibadan to Ilorin. “The original time for the contract in May. They made an argument you cannot fault, that they were given additional work of six months. And if you add an additional six months to that time, you are talking about next year. So, instead of looking at law, look more on practicality and compel them to speed up. “By the time we met yesterday, I realised it is not important I talked about the law, but what of the additional work in stations, tracks, underpasses, flyovers and literally everything affected the time of completion. “Somebody advised me not to talk about the completion date anymore and just continue working. I won’t tell you my conversation with the CCECC chairman, but let’s wait till February 20 when we will be coming back to inspect.” Speaking on some other factors that have delayed the project, the minister said the Chinese contractor did not continue with the various equipment and manpower they used at the start of the project, noting that government would be compelling them to match the speed of work with the right equipment and manpower at various sites. He said at the moment, it is not necessary to pursue law, but the completion of the project, noting that with Apapa seaport congestion primarily depending on the rail project, it was purely logistics that have made the congestion to linger over the time. Dianlong cited the high cost of compensation in the country as obstacles hindering the project completion. Other stakeholders present include Managing Director, Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC), Mr. Fidet Okhiria and Chairman, Board of Directors, NRC, Mallam Ibrahim Al-Hassan-Musa.
