David Umahi Vows not to support older person as successor
Governor David Umahi of Ebonyi State has said that it is too early to talk about 2023 politics because of more important issues like the development of the state. In a statement by his Special Assistant on Media, Francis Nwaze, the governor noted that he could not be distracted by desperate people who were hungry for power and not even for the betterment of the people. His words, “I will not engage in 2023 politics now. I can only talk politics a year to the end of my tenure not now.” Umahi made this known when State Executive Council (EXCO) members led by the deputy governor, Kelechi Igwe, came to thank him for his unflinching support to them and his ability to transform the state in a short time. Appreciating the EXCO members for their support for his administration to achieve great successes, the governor urged them to work in unity this year, as every good work comes without a reward. He promised to empower one person from every EXCO member in business. The governor also stated that his successor would never be older than him, as there were several benefits of having a young and vibrant person as the governor. “I will not support anyone that is older than me for governor come 2023. We need someone that is energetic and ready to lead with every commitment. “We are more concerned with developing the state and cannot be distracted by desperate people who are hungry for power and not for the betterment of the people.” Speaking earlier, the deputy governor had said they came to thank the governor for his unflinching support for the EXCO and his ability to transform the state fast. They prayed the governor not to relent in his avowed commitment in ensuring that Ebonyi sustained the top developing state it had become under his watch.
