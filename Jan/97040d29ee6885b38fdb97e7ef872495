Tragedy struck in Okitipupa, the headquarters of Okitipupa Local Government Area of Ondo State, as a 12-year-old, Oguneso Aanu, was crushed to death by a truck while trying to cross the road to the other side. The Guardian gathered that the incident happened yesterday at about Okitipupa Central Market at about 3:50pm when the tipper driver, Mr. Olawole Akinwole, rammed into the victim.Â It was learnt that the tipper truck was conveying a load of sand from Okitipupa to Ode-Ayeka, a neighbouring town after the market along Igbokoda Road. An eyewitness recounted that several vehicles and motorcycles were parked on the road thereby preventing the victim and other road users to have a clear view of oncoming vehicle, leading to the death of the girl. He added that immediately the incident happened, the driver escaped from the scene to avoid mob action and reported the manslaughter at Okitipupa Police Command. The state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Mr. Femi Joseph, confirmed the incident and noted that the body had been deposited at morgue, while the driver and the truck are in police custody.
