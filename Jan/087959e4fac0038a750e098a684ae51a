Mai Atafo, fashion entrepreneur and the creative director of bespoke fashion label Atafo has stated that there is no luxury brand in Nigeria. Mai Atafo made this declaration earlier today during a session at The Event Experience Africa 2020, an annual conference of event entrepreneurs and professionals. Mai said that his brand, Atafo is not a luxury brand and that he doesn’t think there is a luxury brand in Nigeria yet. He based his claim on our environment and compared it to what you get when you visit fashion stores and hotels abroad. He said luxury is obvious and screams at you when you see it. Therefore, he believes there is no luxury brand in Nigeria. Atafo also stated why he changed his brand name from Mai Atafo to Atafo. He said he needed to separate his person from the brand and it was important for him to grow the brand and what it promises. He stated it was after he took the decision he realised most fashion brands also have a monolithic name. He gave examples like Dior, Versace, Armani etc. Ohimai Atafo is a fashion entrepreneur, he is the founder and creative director of fashion label Atafo, a brand that specializes in bespoke men’s suit and traditional outfits, alongside its sister brand Weddings by Mai Atafo which specialises in Wedding and evening dresses.
