The Aare Onakakanfo of Yorubaland, Gani Adams and Secretary-General Yoruba Council of Elders (YCE), Dr. Kunle Olajide, have urged Yoruba people both at home and in the Diaspora to see the new security task-force code-named ‘Operation Amotekun’ as a step that would eventually rid the zone of insecurity challenges. Adams, who spoke during a press briefing yesterday, said anybody criticising the planned operation could either be a sadist who does not want peace and development of South-West or one who does not value life and property in the region. He said that the initiative would suppress the vagaries of insecurity pervading the Yorubaland in the last five years. He also urged Yoruba people not to politicise the new initiative but to see it beyond party affairs, just as he added that the initiative must not be muddled up with the ambition of some politicians who are already eyeing 2023 presidency. But Olajide, in a telephone conversation with The Guardian, said the plan was good and would help in addressing the insecurity challenges facing South-West. The YCE scribe, therefore, urged the South-West governors to also collaborate on other infrastructural development in the region. He also said that the initiative must be driven by Yoruba people who understand the nooks and crannies of the region and not a situation where people from other regions who do no t understand the terrain would be drafted into it. Meanwhile, the Ondo State government has assured the residents of South-West that operation Amotekun will bring criminalities to zero in the region. While speaking with The Guardian in Ibadan yesterday at the Oyo State Secretariat Complex, Senior Special Assistant on Security Matters to Ondo State Governor, Jimoh Dojumo, said criminals would be driven out of the region.
