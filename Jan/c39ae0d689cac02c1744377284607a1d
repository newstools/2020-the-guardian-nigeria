The Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), trimmed its crude oil production by 100,000 barrels daily (b/d) in December, the latest S&P Global Platts survey finds, putting the bloc under its new, more-stringent quotas a month early.
  
OPEC pumped 29.55 million b/d, according to the survey, with Saudi Arabia producing well below its cap and compliance laggards Iraq and Nigeria improving their discipline.
  
Now entering their fourth year of production cuts to prop up the oil market, OPEC, Russia, and nine other countries agreed last month to deepen their cuts to 1.7 million b/d — of which OPEC would shoulder 1.2 million b/d — from January to March.  Venezuela, also under US sanctions, saw a modest 20,000 b/d rise as its crude exports rebounded, while Ecuador and the Republic of Congo saw similar gains, according to the survey.
  
December was Ecuador’s last month as an OPEC member, with its energy ministry January 2, confirming the country’s decision to exit the organisation due to financial needs that it said made further production cuts unpalatable. But sources close to Ecuador and OPEC told Platts that the two sides have been discussing a potential return.
  
Overall, OPEC’s compliance with its cuts was 158% for December, according to Platts’ calculations. Under the new quotas that went into force January 1, OPEC’s December production would result in 108% compliance.
