•NCS seeks renewed vigour from FG, Private sector to tackle menace
Nigerian banks were estimated to have spent about N200billion preventing various forms of cyber attacks on their operations in the country in 2019.
   
The Nigeria Computer Society (NCS), which revealed this, yesterday, said more efforts must be harnessed locally, to curb the growing menace of cyber attacks in Nigeria.
  
The President of NCS, Prof. Adesina Sodiya, who stated this in an interaction with journalists, in Lagos, noted that two major attacks confronted the financial sector last year, which were Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS), and Social Engineering.
  
DDoS attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt normal traffic of a targeted server, service or network by overwhelming the target or its surrounding infrastructure with a flood of Internet traffic, while Social Engineering attacks are the use of deception to manipulate individuals into divulging confidential or personal information that may be used for fraudulent purposes.
  
Globally, the number of DDoS attacks increased by 84 per cent in the first quarter (Q1) of 2019 compared to Q4 2018, according to research from Kaspersky Lab.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
