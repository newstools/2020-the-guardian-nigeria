Kano State Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje has called on the opposition People’s Democratic Party to work with him in moving the state forward. “Let me call our opposition to rather come and join us to move the state forward,” Ganduje’s spokesman Abba Anwar said in a statement on Monday. “We have a lot of developmental projects on ground and more are coming.” Nigeria Supreme Court on Monday affirmed Ganduje’s election as the governor of Kano State. The judgment by a five-member panel led by Justice Sylvester Ngwuta dismissed the appeal by Abba Kabiru-Yusuf of the People’s Democratic Party challenging the election of Ganduje in the March 9, 2019 governorship election. The five-man panel of the appellate court in its entirety affirmed that Governor Ganduje was validly elected. The governor, however, called on the opposition party to accept the verdict in good faith and join hands in building a sustainable development agenda in Kano. “Our free and compulsory education policy needs all hands on deck,” Ganduje said. Ganduje also applauded the Supreme Court justices for deepening the jurisprudence. He noted that the judiciary has demonstrated hope in democracy. However, in his reaction, Kabiru Yusuf has expressed disappointment in the declaration of the Supreme Court. “Considering the overwhelming evidences presented by the eminent team of experienced lawyers, one cannot imagine how these agents of tyranny and undemocratic principles joined hands to rob the good people of Kano their mandate,” in a statement signed by the spokesman of the governorship candidate, Sanusi Bature Dawakin-Tofa. “However, we have seen the worst of what they can do, so they should await the judgment of the Almighty Allah, which they cannot avoid.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
