After 11 consecutive days uptrend, the Nigerian equities market recorded its first trading loss in the year, yesterday, as the All-Share Index depreciated by 1.18 per cent.
   
The All-Share Index (ASI) shed 350.43 absolute points, representing a decline of 1.18 per cent to close at 29,283.15 points.     Similarly, the overall market capitalisation lost N181 billion to close at N15.106 trillion.
   
The drop in indices may, however be attributed to profit taking by investors as they leveraged the capital appreciation to recoup their investment.
   
The downturn was impacted by loses recorded in medium and large capitalised stocks, amongst which were, Nigerian Breweries, MTN Nigeria, Dangote Cement, United Bank for Africa (UBA), and Zenith Bank.
   
Analysts at APT Securities and Funds Limited, said: “We expect the uptrend to continue with correction days in between propelled by profit takers.”  Access Bank sold 37.33 million shares worth N393.94 million, while FBN Holdings traded 21.97 million shares valued at N157.61 million.
