Egube said that included in the Capital Receipt was a balance of N175 billion brought forward that comprised of proceeds from Year 2019 Loan and Bond issuance of N100 billion and N75 billion respectively.

He said that the government had maintained a conservative posture in its projection for Federal Transfers/Receipts in view of the production challenges within the oil sector.
