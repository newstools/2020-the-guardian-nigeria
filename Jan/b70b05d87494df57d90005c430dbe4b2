Elder statesman and former National Interim Chairman of All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief Bisi Akande, has expressed confidence that the APC will resolve the political crisis in Edo State to enable it win the next governorship election in the state. He said the situation in Edo is still within the capability of the party leadership to manage effectively to guarantee the success of the party in future elections. Akande, while fielding questions from journalists yesterday at his country home, Ila-Orangun, Osun State, as part of activities marking his 81st birthday anniversary, said that the political crisis in Edo State would soon fizzle out and the party would come out of it stronger. The APC leader, who lamented that corruption has become an endemic national problem, noted that President Muhammad Buhari might not have appreciated the enormity of the challenge when he started to wage war against the menace in the society. The elder statesman, who said he did not envy Buhari in the task of fighting corruption in the country, urged Nigerians to support the current administration in its effort to grow the nation’s economy. “When President Buhari came up with his policy to fight against corruption, perhaps he might not know the likely attendant consequences. But I’m sure he is perspiring seriously without people knowing it because corruption is already fighting back.”He, however, urged Nigerians not to leave the battle against corruption to the current administration alone but to shun graft and other corrupt tendencies to put the nation on a path of growth and development. He hinted that he had already commenced discussion on the South-West security network, otherwise known as Amotekun, with Yoruba elders, saying he would refrain from giving details in the media.
