Oluronbi repeatedly raped seven children within 20 years, telling them they could fail exams or become a witch if his advances were refused. The self-proclaimed pastor was convicted of rape and sexual assault against six young girls and the sexual assault of a boy following a nine-week trial at on Friday, 10th January. “These were sickening crimes committed against children who had put their trust in Oluronbi and looked up to him,” detective inspector Dave Sproson, from the Public Protection Unit said. “Oluronbi was arrested in May last year at Birmingham Airport after it was feared he was preparing to flee the country.” His wife, Juliana Oluronbi, was also convicted of two counts of aiding and abetting the rape of a child and one count of aiding and abetting the rape of an adult. According to the police, the abuse began in 1989 when Oluronbi set up a church group at a house in Winson Green, Birmingham. It was after these church meetings the abuse for many of his victims took place.

Oluronbi would brainwash his victims into thinking that the abuse was a normal part of their religion, claiming that it warded off evil and even that it would help improve their school grades. The police said four of the girls got pregnant and when this happened, Oluronbi and his wife arranged for a paid abortion. They said the pastor who is also a pharmacist would sometimes administer the drug on the pregnant girls himself. “When one of the girls left home, the couple – both from Orchid Drive, Hockley – assisted in getting her a flat where the abuse continued despite her telling him repeatedly to leave her alone,” The police said. “Earlier this year, a family member of one of the victims confronted Oluronbi and his wife at their home address where he claimed the devil made him carry out the abuse.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
