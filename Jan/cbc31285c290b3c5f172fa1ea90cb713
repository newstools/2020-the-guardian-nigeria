David Kigoma Onguyi |Web Favourites A Kenyan man identified as David Kigoma Onguyi is in court for what has to be an unusual reason, he is accused of verbally abusing a female trader at Maasai Market in Kenya. According to reports, the middle-aged man who is a porter-cum-menial worker got into a heated exchange with the trader who is simply identified as Nyakobe. The incident is said to have happened last year on December 19 when Onguyi is said to have taken a customer to Nyakobe’s Maasai curio shop. Goods worth Ksh500 were purchased but Onguyi refused to pay Nyakobe but promised to settle the debt “later in the day”. Efforts to get Onguyi to make payments proved futile and ultimately escalated into an argument. Onguyi who allegedly threatened to beat up Nyaboke reportedly told her; “You are dirty just like your vagina, and I know that you do not wear underwear. And, even if you have worn one today, I am sure it is torn. And again, remember to use tissue paper to wipe yourself clean after answering the short call of nature” He was later arrested after the incident was reported at KICC Police Station. He was subsequently charged to court for creating a disturbance in a manner likely to cause a breach of peace on January 5, 2020. He denied the allegations and was later released on a Ksh10, 000 cash bail. The case has since been adjourned until January 21, 2020.
