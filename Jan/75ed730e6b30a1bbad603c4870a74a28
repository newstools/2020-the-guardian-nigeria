Chikamso Ugwumadu is a nine-year-old kid fitness trainer, and anaerobic expert. Her passion is to train children on how to properly exercise, so they can be fit, healthy and agile. She officially started Fat and Fit Kiddies, her fitness outfit, when she was eight years old. How did it all begin? What led her into the fitness field? Interestingly, it all started when she could no longer bear people’s comments about her weight. These were sometimes unkind. Tired of being taunted and ribbed for being overweight, she decided to do something about it. It was particularly painful, and it bothered her so much because she knew she was healthy and fit and could do many things children with regular weight and even those underweight could not do. So, to prove her point, she developed a passion in this area. She upgraded her fitness activities from regular exercise to getting trained by a fitness expert and nutrition specialist. This gave birth to Fat and Fit Kiddies, a fitness outfit that opened on September 1, 2018. The outfit is specially dedicated to encourage and increase children’s consciousness towards maintaining a healthy and fit lifestyle, right from an early age; some sort of catch them young thing. So far, over 1, 300 children have enrolled and engaged in her fitness tours in different localities in Lagos State. And she has been receiving invites from other parts of the country, to bring her tour to those localities. During her one-year celebration of venturing into the fitness arena, she commemorated with children from destitute homes, as well as those with special needs at the National Stadium in Lagos. She explained that the idea was to boost their fitness lifestyle. There were over 50 children in attendance, and the event was aired on Nigeria Television Authority (NTA). She was also at KidBiz Fair, organised by Kidpreneur to drill young participants on aerobics and similar exercise before commencement of the fair.Chikamso has gained recognition and has been honoured with awards, due to her fitness zeal and speaking skill at events. She has featured in NTA Sport, and is a member of Kidpreneur Africa, Kidstainment Hub International and the fitness Ambassador for Save A child Mission. Chikamso is also one of the lucky winners of the Tonya Lawani challenge, where she received a sound system for her Zumba dance class.Today, Chikamso is set to help other children start their fitness journey early because as she said: “Fitness enables a child to become mentally, physically and psychologically active.”Her motto is: Raising a fit and healthy child.
