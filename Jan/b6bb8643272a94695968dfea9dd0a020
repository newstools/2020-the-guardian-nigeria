 WASHINGTON, DC – JANUARY 18: Demonstrators gather in Freedom Plaza at the start of the 2020 Women’s March on January 18, 2020 in Washington, DC. Marches were held nationwide in cities including New York and Los Angeles.

In 2017, the day after Trump’s inauguration, more than three million people gathered nationwide, but numbers have since declined each year. A few thousand protesters gathered in Washington on Saturday, with other small events in New York and elsewhere. Kim Elliott, a 40-year-old Washington resident, carried a placard reading, “I am even more outraged than I was three years ago.” “We all knew that Trump was going to be horrible, and he has been even more horrible than we realize” she told AFP, standing next to her seven-year-old daughter who was participating enthusiastically in her first women’s march.

Lauren Sloniger, a 26-year-old from suburban Washington, used the ironic generational put-down “OK Boomer” on her sign in a reply to Trump’s claims that he did “nothing wrong” in the case that has led to his Senate impeachment trial. She said her message to Trump was, “We see what you did. We are going to call you out on this.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
