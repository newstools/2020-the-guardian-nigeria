The six Southwest governors have been urged to enact laws in their respective states to back the establishment of the joint security outfit codenamed ‘Operation Amotekun.’ The Planter of Christ Apostolic Church (CAC), Adamimogo Outreach and Baba Orioke, Ikeji-Arakeji, Apostle Ayodele Babalola Camp Ground, Prophet Sam Olu Alo who gave the advice in Ado Ekiti, said the law should spell out the terms of reference and mode of operation of the security body. The cleric, however, warned against the politicisation and use of the outfit to witch-hunt perceived political opponents.Alo, who urged Nigerians to return to God for the country to overcome insurgency and other security challenges, cautioned religious leaders against criticising political leaders without telling them the heart of God. He said: “Laws should be enacted by the Southwest governors against the abuse of the outfit. It must not be used to settle political scores or promote sectionalism. Anybody found wanting should be made to face the music. “It must also be sustained by successive government across the state. The fact that the only PDP governor in Southwest supports the initiative showed that Amotekun formation was not political. But the most important thing is that Nigeria must return to God.“Amotekun will begin on a good note, but things may go wrong along the line. We must seek God’s great love in this country.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
