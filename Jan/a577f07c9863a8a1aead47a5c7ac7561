Association of Telecommunications Companies of Nigeria (ATCON) has added its voice to the growing condemnation of the recent hike in right of way (RoW) charges by state governments. The association which spoke on the heels of the federal government’s condemnation of the states’ action said that the recent hike in the cost of RoW by some State governments and agencies is unnecessary as it will be counterproductive and slow down broadband development in the States. ATCON statement signed by Mr Olusola Teniola, its president, said the state governments are needed by telecom companies to make policies that would motivate investment and development of telecom infrastructure needed to deliver hitch free broadband services.
According to him the current move of ROW hike would make it difficult for the broadband development goal to be achieved. Teniola said the socio-economic development of the states is not mutually exclusive to broadband infrastructure development.He said ATCON is aware that the state governments are passionate about improving life expectancy, literacy, and increase level of employment in their respective States and with friendly business environment for telecom Companies, all these goals can be achieved on the condition that the RoW charge is not inimical to the spread of broadband infrastructure development.
