Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has said his administration will continue to provide a safe, secure and friendly environment for businesses to thrive while living up to the expectations of the public with its resources. Sanwo-Olu made the call when he received the Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria (CIBN) team, led by the President and Chairman of Council, Dr. Uche Olowu, in his office. Besides, the Institute sought the governor for the repairs and rehabilitation of dilapidated roads in Lagos State especially in Victoria Island and its environs. The Governor assured of his government’s plan to commence infrastructure renewal, including repairs and upgrading of roads in the state, especially Victoria Island and its environs, in the first quarter of 2020. Sanwo-Olu commended the efforts of the Institute and indeed the banking industry for its various contributions to the development of the state especially toward ensuring an efficient and effective security system. He promised to facilitate the discussion between the Institute and the Lagos State Judiciary on the proposed Seminar for Banking and Allied Matters for Judges. Earlier in his remarks, Olowu explained that the banking industry would continue to partner with the state government towards achieving its goal of transforming Lagos into a Smart City. He reiterated CIBN’s readiness to collaborate with the government in organizing a yearly seminar for Judges on banking and allied matters for the Lagos State Judiciary. According to him, CIBN would leverage on its over 20 years experience of running similar programmes for all the judges in the country, in collaboration with the National Judicial Institute. He further said that the Institute would be most willing to partner with the relevant ministries of the state government to enhance the capacity of their personnel in the area of banking and finance.
