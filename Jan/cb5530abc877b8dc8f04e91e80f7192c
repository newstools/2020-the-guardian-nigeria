Lindsay Lohan seems ready to activate ‘Vision 2020″ too. In a New Year’s Eve interview with Andy Cohen and Anderson Cooper, Lohan said she expects to move back to the U.S. to spend the year reviving her work as an actor and singer. “I’m managing my sister, so I want to really focus on me and everything that I can do in my life, and come back to America and start filming again, which I’m doing something soon in this new year,” said Lohan, who lives in Muscat, Oman. “And, you know, just taking back the life I’ve worked so hard for and sharing it with my family and you guys.”  Lohan’s most recent film credit was the 2019 Belgian-American thriller, “Among the Shadows.” She’s been active on the small screen as of late, hosting the short-lived reality series “Lindsay Lohan’s Beach Club” and serving as a judge on the Australian edition of “The Masked Singer.” And by the look of things, 2020 will mark Lohan’s long-awaited return to music if all goes according to plan. In an interview on Australia’s “The Kris Fade Show” in August, she teased fans with a snippet of a new song titled “Xanax,” though a full recording has yet to be released. When pressed by Cohen about the status of the song, Lohan replied, “Andy, you’re getting it after the new year.” The “Mean Girls” star followed up the interview with an Instagram post thanking Cohen and Cooper, adding, “The future is bright!”
