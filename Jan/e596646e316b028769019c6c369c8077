Several of the rapper’s former bodyguards have parted ways with him for various reasons, but one thing they all have in common is that no amount of money he could pay would bring them back according to TMZ. The ex-members of 6ix9ine’s security team feel he unnecessarily put them in harm’s way before he went to prison so the fact he is a “flat-out rat” now would make things worse. The former bodyguards are also pissed over the “street politics” they were forced to deal with as a result of the problems Tekashi got into which stemmed from him being a “fake gangster.” Also, there are still lots of lingering beef between the rapper and well-known gang members on both the east and west coasts, and ultimately, the consensus is it is not worth risking one’s life to protect a guy with zero street credibility or integrity under any circumstances. 6ix9ine’s not feeling safe as it is behind bars, and wants out of prison ASAP to serve the remainder of his sentence under home confinement. Once his 24-month sentence is up, he’ll be a free man and he’s made it clear he doesn’t plan to enter witness protection because he can pay for 24/7 security.
