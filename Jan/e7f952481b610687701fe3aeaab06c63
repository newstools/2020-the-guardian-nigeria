Ministry of Youth and Sports Development has refuted issuing any presidential endorsement to former World Cruiserweight Champion, Bash Ali, for his planned Guinness Record Fight. In a letter sent to Ali through the sports ministry’s legal department and also made available to The Guardian, advised the boxer to desist from peddling false claims about a non-existent approval from the office of the Minister to embark on a world fight. It added that no such approval was given by the President, contrary to claims by Bash Ali that the endorsement was conveyed to him by office of the minister, and that the boxer should keep to the facts only. “It is to be recalled that on the November 4th, 2019 a meeting was held between the ministry and yourself in the company of director legal and other senior staff of the ministry, wherein the ministry was categorical about not entering into any meaningful discussion with you in relation to the Guinness Record Fight until the litigation between you and the ministry is amicably sorted out. “It is in this regard that this ministry is surprised to note your manipulation of information to the effect that approval has been granted you to carry out the World Guinness Record Fight. “I am accordingly, therefore, by this letter, directed to convey that no approval whatsoever was granted you by Mr. President or the ministry, and it will be in your overall interest to issue another letter stating the factual situation that took place between the office of the Honourable Minister and your good self on the said date in order for us to make further progress on the said matter,” the letter stated.
