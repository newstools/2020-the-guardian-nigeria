The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), said it has stepped up efforts to encourage retail investors to invest in the capital market, to create wealth, deepen the market, and grow Nigeria’s economy.
   
The Acting Director-General of SEC, Ms. Mary Uduk, who spoke to journalists in Lagos on the sidelines of the Thisday Awards 2020, urged investors to look into the capital market for future investments, as various products abound that would suit their needs. She said: “You don’t not need to have so much money to be able to tap into the opportunities available in the capital market. For instance, with the government bond, the minimum investable amount is N10,000 and you can buy in subsequent amounts of N1,000.
   
“We have Collective Investments Schemes (CIS), we have the stocks that you can buy through the stockbrokers, and those you can invest in with as little as N5,000.  “In the past people just go to stockbrokers to buy stocks without having proper knowledge of what to buy but now we are encouraging people to go through the investment schemes.
   
“If you don’t know anything about stocks go through CIS and invest in different stocks so that professionals can manage your investments. If I am a welder for instance and I don’t know anything about investments, I can put my money there and professionals will manage it for me,” she added.
