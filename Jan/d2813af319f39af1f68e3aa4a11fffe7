Unknown arsonists on Friday night set the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) office in Nsukka, Enugu state on fire.
 
The burning of the office may not be unconnected with the bickering over the February 29 council election in the state.
 
Contentions had arisen in Nsukka Council since December 4 last year, when the tenure of elected council chairmen elapsed, over who should fly the PDP ticket in the local government election.
 
PDP chairman in Nsukka Council, Mr Fabian Onah, who confirmed the development, said he was called yesterday morning and informed that part of the party’s building had been set ablaze. “When I got the call, I immediately rushed to the party office to see for myself the level of the inferno and damage. The target was my office as everything in my office was destroyed by fire. All the chairs, tables, documents and other office equipment were destroyed’, he said
    
The Guardian, however, gathered that perturbed by the remonstration against Omeje re-contesting, Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi had summoned a meeting of stakeholders of the party in the area and all the aspirants, where the leaders unanimously endorsed the aspiration of Omeje to return to office.
