 Cast and crew of OMG on stage  One of such is the recently staged musical, OMG. The musical visits Nigerian history to shed light on the contributions and efforts of three Nigerian heroes. They are Olufunmilayo Ransome-Kuti, Margaret Ekpo and Gambo Sawaba. One of the many things these heroes have in common is not just that they were politicians, but that they defied the strong arm of oppression in their time to defend women’s rights. They were activists, who fought for not just the rights of women; they also were part of the fight against colonialism and oppression from leaders. OMG The Musical, which was sponsored by MTN Foundation as part of its arts and culture causes, told the story of a woman marginalised by patriarchy in her society. To discover her potentials, she revisits the past where she meets with Olufunmilayo, Margaret and Gambo, who help her identify her strength. When she returns to the present, she is able to dismantle the patriarchy in her society. The theatre production successfully uses cultural relevance to convey its message.
