We all love to have an extra minute of sleep when the alarm goes off and it’s time for us to get ready in the morning. A new study, however, shows that while this is good for the health of women, long periods of sleep have the opposite effect on men. The research, published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism, found women who have lie-ins could lower their risk of diabetes. On the other hand, the study finds that men who snooze their alarms for just five minutes get the opposite effect as they increase the risk of diabetes. Dr Femke Rutters, from the VU Medical Center in Amsterdam, said: “In a group of nearly 800 healthy people, we observed sex-specific relationships between sleep duration and glucose metabolism. “In men, sleeping too much or too little was related to less responsiveness of the cells in the body to insulin, reducing glucose uptake and thus increasing the risk of developing diabetes in the future. “In women, no such association was observed. This research shows how important sleep is to a key aspect of health.” The maths is simple that morning lie-in is good for women but bad if you are a man!
