• VAT Increase Would Do More Harm To Private Sector – NECA
• Experts, Investors Weigh Gains, Losses, Fears Ahead Take Off
• Demand Counter Measures, Palliatives To Protect Businesses, Poor Nigerians The Federal Government’s aggressive pursuit of increased non-oil revenue to cushion huge budget deficit, will certainly gain further traction beginning from February 1.At least, there is a projection of more than N500b additional inflows from the new rate at 7.5 percent.
 
The government’s persistent fiscal shortfall, arising from uncertainty shrouding the country’s major earner – crude oil – has remained not just a yearly routine, but also an excuse for serial budget failures.With hopes of increased revenue in 2020 now on the upswing, especially with the signing into law of the Finance Bill 2019, the attention is particular on the Value Added Tax (VAT) that was hiked to 7.5 percent, from five percent. Yet, not without adding more controversy in the nation’s “tax basket.”
 
Notwithstanding the “rowdy” herald of the new finance plan ahead of the kick-off this Saturday, there certainly would be interesting figures in the Federation Accounts and government would be smiling to the banks for fat cheques at the end of February. For stakeholders, it is not all about the revenue inflow, but what happens to consumers- the masses, whose standard of living has been subjected to new struggle by the increment, via cost of goods and services. Certainly, there would be continued agitation against over-taxing the citizenry without corresponding evidence of adequate utilisation.
