The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), has unveiled its Nigerian Payments System Risk and Information Security Management Framework, to identify and address sources of systemic risks associated with the payments landscape.
 
The apex bank, which released the framework yesterday on its website, said the structure will guide the management of risks associated with the payments system in Nigeria.
  
Some of the risks that the framework is expected to address are systemic risks; credit risk; liquidity risk; operational risk; compliance, legal and regulatory risk, settlement risk, and information security risk.  “As a result, payment and settlement systems are important potential sources of systemic risks.
 
“Furthermore, the payments system may increase, shift, concentrate or otherwise transform risks in unanticipated ways.
 
“The failure of one or more of the participants in a payment system to settle their payments or other financial transactions could create credit or liquidity problems for participants and their customers.
 
“Such a failure may ultimately undermine public confidence in the nation’s financial system.”
  
Against this backdrop, the apex bank said the framework became imperative to effectively manage the risks associated with the payments system, as disruptions may originate from any of the interdependent entities.
