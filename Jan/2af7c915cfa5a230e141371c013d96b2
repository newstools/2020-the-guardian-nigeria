Prof. Eugene Nnuka, a lecturer at the Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka has urged the Federal Government to ensure the immediate take off of Ajaokuta steel company towards the development of the country. Nnuka who lectures at the Department of Metallurgical and Material Engineering of the university disclosed this in an interview with News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Awka on Monday. “It was a thing of joy when federal government made declaration that it will not allow any person or organisation to stand on the way in reviving the steel company.“Without getting our steel complex in place, there is no way we can be aspiring to be a developed nation. “All hands should be on deck to make Ajaokuta steel company work for our industries to commence serious work of developmental magnitude,’’ he said. Nnuka said that the chain reaction of the steel company’s operation would change the economy of the nation for good. “When this complex is put to work, then we can be rest assured that there will be job opportunities for our teeming youths through the chain reaction of its production.“For the nation to get it right, round pegs should be put in round hole in this regard, for it should be played as politics of who knows who,” he said.
