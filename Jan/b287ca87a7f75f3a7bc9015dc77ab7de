Financial analysts have predicted increased liquidity and domestic participation in the equities market in 2020, considering the recent favourable monetary policy.
   
Although they argued that domestic investors may not sustain the current level of bull-run through 2020, but noted that due to lack of investment vehicles and avenues to channel funds, the equities market remains a good option for investors.
   
Specifically, the Head, Research and Strategy at Codros Securities, Jolomi Odonghanro, said equities currently offer the best long -term inflation hedge.  “The CBN allows banks to chase any obligor. Any obligor to any bank is seen as significantly positive. It means you will have a reduced NPL from this obligor that are actually strategically defaulting. It is positive for the banking sector.”
   
Also speaking, a macroeconomic analyst at Codros, Wahab Mustapha, urged long-term investors “to take positions in our recommended stocks, with a view to extracting value as the market corrects in future periods.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
