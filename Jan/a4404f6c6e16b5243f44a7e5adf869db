Nigerians have been assured that the Ajaokuta-Itobe Bridge is intact and structurally stable, against insinuations that the bridge had divided into two and was no longer passable. Federal Controller of Works in Kogi, Kajogbola Jimoh, disclosed this during an on-the-spot assessment of the bridge with officials of the Federal Roads Maintenance Agency (FERMA) on Friday.FERMA’s clarification came against the backdrop of public outcry on the worsening nature of a section of the bridge. Jimoh said the bridge only required routine maintenance, while assuring that the Federal Government was on top of the situation.He said the only issue was the missing 40mm electrometric rubber base plates covering expansion joints, which had chopped off, as a result of vehicular movements on the bridge. “I am assuring Nigerians that this bridge is stable. Trailers are passing and you have seen it yourself. The bridge is stable. You don’t need to entertain any fear,” he said. Jimoh hinted that contract for the maintenance work on the bridge was underway.“I have discussed with the Director, Bridge Design, in the Ministry and he assured me that by next week, the contractor would move to site. Next week, they will start working on this bridge,” he said. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
