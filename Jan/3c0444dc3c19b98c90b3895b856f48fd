An Abuja High Court sitting in the Bwari area on Friday sacked Senator Ifeanyi Ubah of the Young Progressives Party (YPP). The court, in a ruling by Justice Bello Kawu, nullified Ubah’s election, for allegedly using a forged National Examination Council (NECO) certificate to contest the senatorial election that was held in the state on February 23, 2019. The judge had on April 11, 2019, ordered that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), to withdraw the Certificate of Return it issued to Ubah and issue a fresh one to Obinna Uzoh of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), who came second in the poll. Ubah polled a total of 87, 081 votes to emerge, winner of the Anambra South Senatorial District. He, however, appealed the judgement stating that it is a grave miscarriage of justice against him. Ubah said he was neither served with the court processes nor hearing notice with respect to the suit before the court proceeded to deliver the judgment against him. Following his application for a stay of execution, Justice Kawu, on December 4, restrained the Senate president from swearing-in Uzoh, pending the hearing and determination of the motion challenging the verdict.
The court equally ordered all the parties, including the INEC to maintain the status quo until it decides the merit in Ubah’s contention. But the judge on Friday held that  Ubah’s application to vacate its judgment lacked merit and accordingly dismissed it. It also dismissed a motion another claimant to the PDP senatorial ticket, Chief Chris Uba, filed to be joined as an interested party in the substantive suit marked CV/3044/2018, which was filed before the court by an electorate in the state, Anani Chuka.
