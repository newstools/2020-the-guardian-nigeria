In line with this, the Oscar nominations will today reveal which stars and movies have a shot at Hollywood’s ultimate prize, as the industry nervously awaits the number of women and minorities selected. Favorites for best picture include Quentin Tarantino’s 1960s Tinseltown homage “Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood,” and Sam Mendes’s World War I odyssey “1917.” Both won major honors at the recent Golden Globes. Martin Scorsese’s crime epic “The Irishman” and South Korean class satire “Parasite” are also expected to feature. It is worthy to note that up to 10 films can be nominated for the top prize. Controversy over omissions of women and minorities in an industry criticised for its lack of diversity was fueled at last week’s Bafta nominations, which were also condemned for overlooking ethnic minorities. One Academy voter who asked not to be named said he was “anticipating that it’s likely going to be very controversial” again Monday because “a lot of male directors” will be nominated. “Unfortunately there are just five nominees” for best director in an “incredibly strong year,” pointing to the revered track records of Scorsese, Tarantino, and Mendes. The Academy “wants to choose the best but they also want to be sensitive to women and minorities,” said Chris Beachum, of award tracking website Gold Derby. Non-white stars such as Lupita Nyong’o, Cynthia Erivo, and Awkwafina could feature alongside best actress frontrunners Renee Zellweger and Charlize Theron, he predicted, while Eddie Murphy is in the running for best actor. In the round of voting just closed, members were asked to rank their top choices only for best picture, and for the specific Academy branch to which they belong.
Voting for winners, in which members can vote in every category, begins January 30, closing five days later. The Oscars will be handed out in Hollywood on February 9.
