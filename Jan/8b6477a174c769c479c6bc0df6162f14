She was made the African Union Representative and she dedicated her time to fighting against neo-colonialism and western interference in Africa with a special focus on France as a coloniser. Speaking about the neo-colonialist nature of France that has successfully put Africa in a continual 3rd world developing cadre, she said: “France that the $500 billion you are taking out of Africa every year, no more. France needs to be the Third World developing country, not Africa. No more shall we continue to be exploited. France can no longer take $500 billion out of Africa.” Her quotes
Often, political activists have political sayings to push their agenda in a simpler manner to their audience while also capturing the deepest essence of their messages. Arikana also have some sayings in which she used in voiving her oppostion to neo-colonial rule by France and they include: “We are beautiful, intelligent, sophisticated, highly adaptable and totally indestructible people – the Africans. Any other race that would have gone through what we’ve been subjected to would have been extinct and that’s the truth.” “We are the original people and we have every reason to stand up in the tallest mountains to proclaim who we are.” “For Africa to take its rightful place on the world stage, the gutter of the mind that we have lived in for centuries, must be cleaned out.” “Everybody is talking about the monkeys and the squirrels in the room, but no one wants to touch the 10,000-pound gorilla in the room, and that is our thinking, of the African people. How much do we understand our Africa? Why is it that the richest continent on Earth is painted as the poorest?” Dr. Arikana has challenged political power holders and they have been shaken to the core of their beings with toes have been stepped on, she has left an indelible mark in the sand of time and this will go a long way in unraveling and shaking the world order.
