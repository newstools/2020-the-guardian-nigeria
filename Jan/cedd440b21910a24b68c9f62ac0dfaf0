It may seem that controversial Nigerian singer, Azeez Fashola, popularly known as Naira Marley, may have broken his non-societal-conformist ‘No Manners’ lifestyle code when he took to Twitter, yesterday, to advice youths to safeguard their future. According to the Tesumole crooner, youths are supposed to enjoy their youthful age, but not at the expense of destroying their future. He said, “As a Marlian, u have to enjoy your youth, but don’t destroy your future (sic).” The 25-year-old London-trained graduate of Business Law also shocked his massive fan base, otherwise known as Marlians, when he harped on youths having a role to play in the country’s anti-corruption fight. “Our only job as a youth is to fight corruption but we just don’t know it yet,” he said. Marley is a popular promoter of a societal non-conformist lifestyle, which he reflects in his music and public appearances. He has since amassed a huge following, the majority of who also actively imitate his lifestyle with the ‘No manners’ anthem. It would be recalled that last year, the Soapy crooner was arrested by the country’s anti-graft agency, Economic and Financial Crimes Commission on charges bordering on Internet fraud and cybercrime and is expected to face the Lagos High Court, in February. Even recently, a Lagos-based civil society group, Child Rights Advocates, berated him for being a negative influence on teenagers across the country.
