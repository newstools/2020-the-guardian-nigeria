Aviation security at Mallam Aminu Kano International Airport, Kano Monday detained the official vehicle of Director General, Kano Hisbah Board Mohammad Harun Ibn-Sina after beating up two officials of the Sharia police. The incident occurred after a heated argument between the security organ of the Federal Airport Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) and Ibn-Sina’s personal aides over the wrong parking of the DG’s official vehicle. The Guardian gathered that two personal security aides to the Hisbah boss were overpowered by the aviation security and molested in their official uniforms. They were later dragged into the airport detention. An eyewitness said Ibn-Sina’s aides were being instructed by the FAAN officials to relocate their vehicle to a commercial location where vehicle park attract charges which they refused. The source disclosed that the unresolved argument and outright refusal of the Hisbah men to relocate their vehicle led to physical combat between men of both agencies. The Guardian learnt that the Hisbah officials were awaiting the arrival of the DG whose flight is scheduled to land 2:00 pm. Efforts by our correspondent to speak to the authorities of the aviation security were declined. Spokesperson of Hisbah board Lawan Ibrahim, who confirmed the incident, promised to provide more information on the matter.
