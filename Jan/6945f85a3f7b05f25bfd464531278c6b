Shehu Sani Officials of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) yesterday raided the two houses of civil rights activist, Senator Shehu Sani, in Abuja in search of incriminating evidence to support the allegation of extortion levelled against him by Chairman of ASD Motors, Alhaji Sani Dauda. The Senior Adviser to Sani on Politics and Strategy, Ahmed Suleiman, told The Guardian in a telephone interview that he was in company of the EFCC officials and the senator to the two houses and office. According to him, “I am with them here where they are searching for incriminating evidence against Senator Sani in his two houses and office in Abuja, but up till now, they have not found anything.” “As far as we are concerned, Shehu Sani’s ordeal in the hands of the EFCC is politically-motivated. If you recall, Senator Sani has been critical about the activities of the Buhari government and they are not happy with him. I can assure you that they cannot silence Shehu Sani. “He is supposed to be facing a civil case. How come they seized his handsets and they are asking for their passwords.” Ahmed stated that the alleged extortion case labelled against Sani by the Chief Executive Officer of ASD Motors before the EFCC took a new dimension on Thursday, January 2, 2020 as Dauda had allegedly dragged names of more prominent Nigerians, including Malam Isa Funtua, into the case. According to him, Sani had met the EFCC bail conditions and was to be released yesterday but for the new list into the case, he (Sani) was detained for further investigations.
