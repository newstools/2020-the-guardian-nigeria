 Chief of Army Staff, Lt. General Tukur Buratai (left) and Yobe governor, Mai Mala Buni after a closed-door meeting yesterday on the security situation in the state.<br />  The reopening of the markets was the fallout of yesterday’s meeting between the governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni and the Chief of Army Staff, Lt. General Tukur Yusuf Buratai, in the army chief’s residence in Abuja. The governor, who discussed a wide range of critical security issues with the army chief, expressed appreciation to the Nigerian Army and other branches of the nation’s security forces for their effort in combating Boko Haram insurgency and other criminal activities in Yobe. Buni, therefore, called on law-abiding citizens of the state to continue to cooperate with the army and other security agents to ensure the full return of peace across the state. He urged citizens in Kuka-Reta and Buni-Yadi and other towns to remain vigilant in their markets and neighborhoods and report any suspicious activity or persons whenever they notice one to the security agencies. The governor expressed confidence that with the support and cooperation of the people, Yobe will emerge stronger and more resilient from the security challenges that have bedeviled it for many years.
