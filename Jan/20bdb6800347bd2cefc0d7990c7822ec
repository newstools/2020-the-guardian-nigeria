 Onoriode ‘Godzilla’ Ehwarieme crowned champion after beating Argentine Ariel ‘Chiquito’ Baracamonte to the World Boxing Federation (WBF) Intercontinental heavyweight title at TBS in Lagos<br />Photos: Akin Farinto (GOtv)<br />  “Dad, this is the first time I am going to face a foreigner in front of my fellow countrymen and women in Lagos. I need your prayer and moral support.” In his response, Pa Ehwarieme, a former footballer, said: “We are solidly behind you. I have been praying for days, and I believe that God will grant you the wisdom and strength to conquer your opponent inside the ring tonight.” The senior Ehwarieme, a retired civil servant revealed to The Guardian just before the commencement of the fight that he fasted and prayed for several days for his son’s victory. As it turned out, the battle of Tafawa Balewa Square, (TBS) Lagos became one of the easiest fights for Onoriode, who against all expectations secured the title after his combination of vicious blows floored a giant-looking Argentine boxer in the 12-round bout. It took just one minute and 16 seconds, and Ariel ‘Chiquito’ Bracamonte was already crawling on the floor. The victory at GOtv Boxing Night 20 was the 17th knockout in Ehwarieme’s boxing career. Ehwarieme, who is 6ft 7/201cm tall, is being tagged as the new ‘Mike Tyson’ by his fans. They believe that the Nigerian has what it takes to rule the world as Tyson did in his active days.

With the WBF Intercontinental heavyweight title now secured, Ehwarieme is looking forward to a bigger challenge early in the year. He told The Guardian shortly after the victory against Bracamonte that his ambition was to contest for a world title in the United States or in any other country very soon. “I am looking forward to a bigger challenge very soon, maybe in the next three months,” Ehwarieme stated. He revealed why he decided to unleash the ‘killer blow’ on his Argentine opponent at the TBS. “I have known Bracamonte as an aggressive and stubborn boxer. He has fought in various categories including the World Boxing Organisation (WBO). His aim was to destabilise me as early as possible. He (Bracamonte) actually torched me in the 12th seconds, and I felt the impact of his blow. But I decided to change my pattern immediately. I realised that it was dangerous staying so close to him. What I did was to stay away and make use of my long-range. I am happy it paid off immediately for me. I thank all my fans who came from far and near to support me,” Ehwarieme stated. Ehwarieme was born and brought up in Sapele, though he hails from Oghara, headquarters of Ethiope West Local Government Area of Delta State. He attended Ethiope primary and secondary school in Sapele, where he had his primary and post-elementary education. He started his boxing career in 2003 following advice he got from one Efe Okitikpe. For years, Delta State from the South-South of Nigeria has been the dominant state in the nation’s sports, producing great athletes from various fields, including track and field, boxing, tennis, and football. From the then Mid-Western region in 1963 to Bendel State in 1976, and its creation in 1991, Delta has been the commander-in-chief as far as Nigerian sports is concerned.
