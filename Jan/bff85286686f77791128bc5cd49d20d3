The Supreme Court on Monday in Abuja, however, upheld the election of Tambuwal as a duly elected governor of the state and dismissed the appeal by APC and Aliyu for lacking in merit. One of the youth Aliyu Usman who spoke with NAN, thanked Almighty Allah for the governor’s success at the Apex Court. Usman said that the jubilation was to show gratitude to God over the victory of Tambuwal, insisting that the apex court’s decision was “an affirmation of the real mandate of the people.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
