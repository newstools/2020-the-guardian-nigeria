Maezawa is the head of an online Japanese fashion empire and has a net worth of approximately $2 billion, according to Forbes. He also famously paid his way to become the first private passenger to visit the moon with Elon Musk’s aerospace company SpaceX. The billionaire posted a New Year’s message on Twitter announcing he was giving away more than $9 million (or one billion Japanese yen), to be divided between 1,000 lucky people as part of an experiment to see if the extra cash will make them “happy.” If you are not Japanese, do not bother because the contest was open to anyone with a Twitter account over the age of 13 and who are residents of Japan. The randomly-selected 1,000 winners, who will receive approximately $9,000 each, will be notified via Twitter’s direct messages. He explained in a YouTube video that one of his “biggest regrets” was not explaining his reasoning for the contest last year, which was 10 times smaller than 2020’s giveaway. When the give away is done, he explains he hopes to keep in touch this time and hear feedback.
