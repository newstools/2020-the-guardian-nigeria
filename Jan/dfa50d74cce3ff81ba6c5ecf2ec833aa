The report noted in all, $8.05 billion was the economic cost of Internet shutdowns globally in 2019, which was an increase of 235 per cent since 2015/16. The report said 122 major shutdowns took place in 21 countries in the year under review. Total hours of 18,225 were lost in the process globally to all major shutdowns around the world. The report claims 11,857 hours were lost to Internet blackouts, while 6,368 hours was lost by social media shutdowns. According to the report Iraq was the most economically-impacted nation, followed by Sudan and India. WhatsApp was the most-blocked platform with 6,236 total hours of disruption. The body said it collated every national and region-wide incident, and used the determined the duration of the restrictions and Cost tool to calculate their economic impact. The tool was developed by Internet monitoring NGO Netblocks and advocacy group The Internet Society, and uses indicators from the World Bank, the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), Eurostat and US Census. The report noted that where access to popular social media platforms, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter or YouTube have been blocked, the move can be circumvented by using a VPN. According to the report, during the analysis of every Internet shutdown in 2019, some general trends emerged. They most often occur in response to protests or civil unrest, especially surrounding elections, as authoritarian regimes look to restrict the flow of information and maintain their grip on power. In economic terms, disruptions not only affect the formal economy but also the informal, especially in less well-developed nations. There can also be lasting damage with the loss of investor confidence and faltering development, all of which makes our estimates conservative. On the human rights side, the report noted that these shutdowns clearly impact citizensâ€™ freedom of expression and the right to information and may even result in an increase in violence. Despite their negative impact on the global economy, human rights and democratic processes, there is little to suggest that internet shutdowns will stop in 2020.
