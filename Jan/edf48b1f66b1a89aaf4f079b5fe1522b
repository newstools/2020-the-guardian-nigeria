He said: “Some teenagers attended a picnic and while at the party, they had a misunderstanding and one of the boys went home and equipped himself with weapons and charm. On his way back, some persons accosted the suspect and discovered those items he had on him. “After they interrogated him, they decided to send somebody to his dad to report what they found on him, but the father (Ogar Ogbudu) went inside and brought out a container with acid and sprayed on everybody who gathered to resolve the situation. “They were more than 27 affected who were immediately rushed to the General Hospital in Igoli, Ogoja. The perpetrator has been captured by the youths in the community and he will be questioned before the elders though he has already been beaten with machetes too,” Omgbidu narrated.
