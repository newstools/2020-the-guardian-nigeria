Kano State government Wednesday said it has commenced the implementation of new salary package of N30,600 in the state. A statement signed by Commissioner for Information, Malam Muhammad Garba noted that workers in the state have started receiving the consolidated wages from December 2019 salary. Malam Garba gave government assurance to settle arrears of April November 2019 on instalments bases. An agreement, he said, had already reached between the state government and the Joint Public Service Negotiation Council (JNC). The commissioner, therefore, appealed to civil servants to reciprocate the gesture by dedicating themselves to their duties so as to improve service delivery. He also called on workers, particularly those in the revenue-generating entities to make an extra effort by ensuring that taxable individuals and corporate entities always pay their dues so that government continue its laudable development programmes for the teeming populace. With over 180,000 population of public servants in Kano, the state government will commit over N10 billion monthly to service the new wage bill, The Guardian learnt. The government has set a motion to redouble its income generation with the committee headed by the chief of staff to the governor, charged with a target of 300 per cent increment beginning from 2020.
