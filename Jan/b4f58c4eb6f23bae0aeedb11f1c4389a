Lagos State Commissioner for Health, Prof. Akin Abayomi, has restated the commitment of the state government to integrate traditional, complementary and alternative medicine practice into healthcare delivery system in the state to achieve Universal Health Coverage. Abayomi, who disclosed this yesterday while inaugurating a 27-member Lagos State Traditional Medicine Research Committee, stated that the present administration remains committed to the realisation of universal health coverage and would not relent in initiating numerous strategies and implementing programmes and projects aimed at reinvigorating the health sector to bring about the desired changes and promote the attainment of universal healthcare delivery in Lagos. In another development, Lagos State has empowered 40 youth fish farmers in the sea caging culture system in Afowo Community in Badagry with 40 cages of 1,000 juvenile cat-fish per cage under the cage culture project. The state Commissioner for Agriculture, Gbolahan Lawal, who disclosed this yesterday at an inspection tour of the facility, said that the cage culture system of fish farming was one of the ways being championed by the state government to maximise the benefits of the abundance of water resources in the state, which accounts for about 22 per cent of the state’s landmass.
