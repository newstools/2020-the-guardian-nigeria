It should come as no surprise as a decade ends and a new one begins, that Pantone would revisit the blue colour family ahead of a year that will carry plenty of changes, fears, and hopes as it ushers in a new phase. Laurie Pressman, Vice President of the Pantone Colour Institute says it’s a reassuring blue, full of calm and confidence and builds connection. She added that the colour highlighted dependability, trustworthiness, credibility, and constancy, all traits that are valued in the fast-paced, high-stress situations of the current world. She also pointed out that the deep blue matches that of the sky at dusk, which provides an apt example of why this colour can resonate with so many people. Indeed, the colour seems especially fitting for this moment in time; the hue is genderless and seasonless as well as versatile, making it both accessible and desirable, for people of all walks of life. From baby blue to sky blue, marine blue to royal blue, shades of blue can be flattering on all body types. Additionally, its indigo shade can be achieved naturally from plants and dyes, making it a colour that aligns well with the sustainability movement, echoing last year’s concentrated focus on sustainability with the selection of living coral as the 2019 colour of the year. If you’re looking for ways to integrate shades of blue into your wardrobe, here are some ways to integrate the Pantone colour of the year 2020 into your daily looks. Jackets
A jacket is one of the easiest ways to add colour to your outfits, especially if you’re comfortable wearing neutrals most of the time. A pop of blue to throw on your outfit will instantly liven it and give it sophistication. 

Tops, Dresses, Bottoms
Jeans and top outfit needs minimal effort and zero complication when it comes to styling. You don’t need to panic about what colour to pair them with because it looks really great with jeans. As for dresses, you can decide to go for a monochrome look or mix and match appropriately. Accessories
If you don’t want colour in your clothing at all, shoes and bags are a good way to add a pop of classic blue. Blue and black go together perfectly, so you don’t have to worry about what colour to wear it with, and you can just buy a beautiful handbag or classic stilettos and that’s perfect for a night out. Suits
Suits are trending like crazy. They’re absolutely everywhere, so you’re bound to run into a classic blue suit. It’s so chic and subtle compared to pink or green suits if that’s too far off for you. Hair
If you are looking for a snazzy, bold look, blue is definitely the way to go. Asides being a bit unconventional, you will stand out from the crowd. <img src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/hot-trend-1.jpg" alt="" width="541" height="675" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1088760 lazyload" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/hot-trend-1.jpg 541w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/hot-trend-1-479x598.jpg 479w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/hot-trend-1-446x557.jpg 446w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/hot-trend-1-192x240.jpg 192w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/hot-trend-1-385x480.jpg 385w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/hot-trend-1-481x600.jpg 481w" sizes="(max-width: 541px) 100vw, 541px" /> <img src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/actress.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="719" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1088761 lazyload" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/actress.jpg 1280w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/actress-640x360.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/actress-1062x598.jpg 1062w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/actress-320x180.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/actress-281x158.jpg 281w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/actress-562x316.jpg 562w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/actress-531x299.jpg 531w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/actress-487x274.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/actress-974x547.jpg 974w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/actress-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> <img src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/toni-tones.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="850" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1088762 lazyload" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/toni-tones.jpg 680w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/toni-tones-478x598.jpg 478w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/toni-tones-446x557.jpg 446w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/toni-tones-192x240.jpg 192w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/toni-tones-384x480.jpg 384w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/toni-tones-480x600.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
