President Muhammadu Buhari curiously announced the other day in Egypt, Nigeria’s visa-on-arrival policy for all Africans. President Buhari at the Peace and Development Summit in Egypt disclosed that Nigeria would begin issuing visa-on-arrival to all African nationals with effect from January 2020. The implication is that fellow Africans can now visit Nigeria with minimal restrictions. They no longer have to queue and wait for weeks or months to be granted permit into the most populous African country, indeed the beacon of hope of the black race. There were dark hints last weekend that the policy had taken off at the entry ports and points despite a parliamentary query that the policy had not been endorsed by the country’s legislature. This is incredible as there should be no haste in implementing this sensitive policy if its specific objective is for ease of African integration. 
 
On the face of it, the policy is long overdue as Nigeria leads the way in promoting free movement of persons, goods and services for African integration. No doubt, open arms to all our neighbours demand much more than an intent of friendship. It requires caution, awareness and preparedness on the home front – if it must safeguard national security, health and economic wellbeing. 
 
Apparently hearing the big brother’s pronouncement on the prime-time news like other Nigerians, members of the National Assembly immediately raised concerns and summoned the Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola. The senator’s eyebrow widened because the real intent of the declaration was not known. A president who cannot unveil policies at home can hardly be trusted. More so, under Buhari, Nigerians are always the last to come to knowledge of their own matter as the president is more comfortable talking from abroad. If we shall be welcoming more Africans to our neighbourhood, Nigerians need to know what terms and conditions apply through the Interior Ministry.  The invitation to our African brothers must, however, be treated with the outmost caution it deserves to ensure that only the right persons are beneficiaries. Nigeria already has her plate full of challenges than to be bothered with fresh threats on accounts of welcoming Africa with open arms. This newspaper would, in the main, like to appeal to the authorities concerned to embark on civic education and public enlightenment on this policy, lest most people would run away with some impression that it is to allow the Fulani nation in West Africa to migrate to Nigeria.
