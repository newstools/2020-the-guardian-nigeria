With plans by the Federal Government to begin the recertification of gas cylinders later in the year, the Nigeria Liquefied Petroleum Gas Association (NLPGA), has said recertification plants would address the incessant fire outbreaks associated with LPG usage. According to the President, NLPGA, Nuhu Yakubu, the plants would also help to identify bad and faulty cylinders from the good ones. Yakubu at the Association’s yearly meeting in Lagos, said the federal government is ready with the recertification exercise going by the declaration made by the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Silva, last year December, saying that 2020 would be a year for gas. “It is very important that we have cylinder requalification plants because this is the only way we can manage safety issues. We can identify bad and faulty cylinders from the good cylinders and the only way we can achieve this is by requalification plants and this is why this initiative is very much in the minds of the federal government,” he stated. He added that cylinder ownership is a win-win for all, pointing out that consumer complaints would be addressed as soon as the federal government’s initiative kicks off in the third quarter of 2020. He added: “We are increasing stakeholders’ engagement such as this to bring all the issues bothering the LPG sector so that we can all understand what the issues are so that we can find solutions to them. We will take it further beyond the Annual General Meeting (AGM).” He said training, awareness dissemination and sensitisation is the way to go in identifying issues of safe practices in gas consumption and handling. “That is exactly what we are doing. You have to teach someone that has been using firewood all his life how to use gas. You must even teach him how to light a stove. Gas fire outbreaks are the easiest to put off, but most of the users do not know,” he said. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
