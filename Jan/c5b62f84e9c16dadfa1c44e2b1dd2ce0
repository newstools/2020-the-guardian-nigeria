Over 26,000 tweets have been tailored towards Nigeria’s Senate Minority leader Eyinnaya Abaribe’s call for the immediate resignation of President Muhammadu Buhari following the escalating security challenges in the country. The reaction, which has been number one on twitter trend table with the hashtag #Buhariresign, is largely in support of Abaribe’s request. “If you want to treat an issue, you go to the head. We did not appoint the IG or the security chiefs. We will go to the president and ask him to resign,” Abaribe said at the plenary on Wednesday. Issues of state police, lack of coordination and lack of synergy among the security agencies, lack of political will, and the expiration of the tenure of the service chiefs formed the thrust of the debate which got escalated after Abaribe’s, a senator of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party, comments. The federal lawmaker said President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration deserved to be “stoned out of power” for not living up to the expectations of Nigerians. He accused the government of using propaganda to deceive Nigerians. However, while reacting to Abaribe’s comments, the presidency described the call as “foolish.” A spokesman, Garba Shehu, said Buhari cannot resign based on the “stray” opinion of an “armchair critic”. However, Abaribe’s comment resonated with a lot of Nigerians who are trending #BuhariResign on Twitter.       To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
