President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday ordered the Nigeria Air Force (NAF) to deploy fighter aircraft for effective air attacks against bandits, kidnappers and cattle rustlers terrorising communities around Dogon Gona forest in Niger State. The President, who described the repeated attacks leading to the loss of several lives in the communities “as a disaster for the nation,” directed the deployment of air power to support troops and policemen deployed for counter attacks in the forest area bordering Kaduna, Niger and Zamfara states. In line with the directive, NAF is setting up refueling facilities at Minna, Niger State to support the aircraft operations, assuring that given the improved weather conditions, a major exercise to “visually acquire targets” and launch attacks will soon follow. The presidency confirmed this in a statement issued by Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity to the President, Garba Shehu. He explained that the Niger State Police Command has also assured that the air raids to complement the police helicopter gunship operations remained the best approach given the lack of motorable roads in the areas constantly under attack. President Buhari also commiserated with the government and people of Niger State following the attacks and loss of lives, assuring that the rest of the country would not abandon victims and communities in the state.
