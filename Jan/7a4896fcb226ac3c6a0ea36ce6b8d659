According to a report by Huff Post, the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been frequently criticised in the past for its lack of LGBTQ representation, and asked about the possibility of them introducing a “specifically trans” character, Feige replied: “Yes, absolutely yes.” He added: “Very soon, in a movie we’re shooting right now, yes.” While Fiege did not elaborate further, fans have noted that The Eternals is currently at the shooting stage. In a previous report, it has been disclosed that the movie will also introduce the franchise’s first gay character, as well as its first deaf superhero. Speaking about the gay character, Fiege said on Good Morning America last year: “He’s married, he’s got a family, and that is just part of who he is.” Fiege said recently he wanted to continue to better reflect audiences especially in the representation of women and Black people in some of the MCU’s previous films: “You look at the success of Captain Marvel and Black Panther. We want the movies to reflect the audience and we want every member of our global audience to see themselves reflected on the screen.” The Eternals marks the start of the fourth phase of the MCU following the conclusion of the Avengers Infinity saga and will star Angelina Jolie, Richard Madden, Kit Harington, and Kumail Nanjiani.
