Armed robbers operating on a motorcycle on Tuesday night shot dead a member of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) serving in Osun State, Mukaila Adebayo. The Guardian learnt that Adebayo was accosted by the two-man robbery gang at his containerized shop in Omo-west area, Osogbo, where he sold credit recharge cards, cable subscription and also engaged in mobile money transfer. The deceased, popularly called Alfa in the neighbourhood, was said to have been dispossessed of a bag containing cash, refilled vouchers, POS machine and bunch of keys before he was later shot by the assailants after closing for the day at his shop at about 11:00p.m. The criminals later escaped on a motorcycle after they fired some gunshots into the air to scare the residents in the area. An eyewitness, Alani Azeez, said the incident occurred late in the night and the sound of gunshot was too frightening for anybody to accost the robbers. So, no one could come out to offer help to the corps member until about 20 minutes after when residents were sure the robbers were not lurking around. The deceasedâ€™s daughter (name withheld) was said to be with his father when he was shot and was crying for help after the robbers had escaped.An official of the Public Relations Unit of the state NYSC confirmed the incident, adding that the deceased was a serving corps member in the state. She said the NYSC secretariat had contacted and condole with the family.The state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Folasade Odoro, also confirmed the incident.
