• Labour says it is a mere proposal The Special Adviser to Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State on Labour Matters, Chief Ode Enyi, yesterday disclosed that the state government had approved implementation of the new N30,000 minimum wage for workers in the state.But the state Chairman of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) in Benue State, Godwin Anya, in a reaction said it was a mere proposal and not approval as stated by the government. Enyi, while briefing newsmen in his office, said both Labour and government reached an agreement that the new wage should be pegged at N30,009.99 in the state. He further stated that all arrangements for the implementation of the wage would have been concluded, but was stalled following the delay of the case at the Supreme Court between Ortom and candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Emmanuel Jime.He expressed the readiness of the governor to tackle issues of workers with all seriousness. Enyi also restated the resolve of the governor that Benue belongs to all and utmost interest and well-being of the state is paramount.He said: “The meeting of the committee was scheduled to be reconvened on a later date to address other adjustment issues of salary level seven and above with level one to six settled. “The minimum wage was presented to the Labour with a consequential agreement that other structures will be adjusted.“We would have concluded the negotiation but the meeting was suspended because of the Supreme Court judgment.“You know Benue workers are currently the third highest paid in Nigeria in terms of salary, but the governor has always insisted that the minimum wage is not enough. The NLC chairman said approval had not been done yet, adding that they were only handed over the new minimum wage structure to study.“Government has just presented to us the new minimum wage to study. So far, no agreement has been reached and the case of workers on level seven and above has not even been mentioned. “Everything as it is now has been stalled because of the Supreme Court case,” Anya noted.
