Ahead of its reopening in April, the Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA), has upgraded the Instrument Landing System/Distance Measuring Equipment (ILS/DME) at the Akanu Ibiam International Airport, Enugu, to Category II.
  
The upgrade was completed at the weekend with the installation of new landing equipment.
A successful site acceptance test on the equipment has also been conducted by NAMA engineers in Enugu, in preparation for its calibration in the coming days.
  
In a related development, the agency has also installed a VSAT (Very Small Aperture Terminal) for satellite communication at the Airport, in a bid to address communication blind spots in the Lagos South East corridor.
