The Pontiff was in the Vatican on Tuesday, ready to go into a new year with a line of adoring fans and worshippers many of whom he was happily greeting and shaking hands with along his route. It was all going great, up to the point some woman felt she needed to hold him back. The pope not too pleased with this ends up shaking her hand, but she clamps on to his arm and yanks him back. He slaps her hand a couple of time and when his handlers finally step in, she releases him. The Pontiff wasnâ€™t too happy as he was seen walking away with a stern look on his face. After this incident, some kid fell right in front of the Pope as he was walking along, and Francis was quick to attend to him and give him a pat on the head once he realized he was alright. People holding on to their favourite stars is not a new thing, especially, in the entertainment industry. However, it seems it is all strange and new to the pope.
