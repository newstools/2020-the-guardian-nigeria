Barcelona confirmed Setien’s appointment following a board meeting that lasted more than four hours on Monday. His contract runs until 2022 although there is a break clause in 2021, to allow for change after the club’s presidential elections. Valverde is the first coach to be sacked by Barca mid-season since Louis van Gaal in 2003. Barcelona sits top of La Liga, albeit level on points with Real Madrid, and face Napoli next month in the last 16 of the Champions League. Xavi came through the Barcelona academy before breaking the record for most appearances for the senior side, winning four Champions League trophies and eight La Liga titles. He joined Al-Sadd as a player in 2015 before being appointed coach last July. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
