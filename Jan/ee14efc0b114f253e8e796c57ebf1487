The International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) has given Nigeria among other countries another opportunity to be part of the table tennis event at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics in the World Team Olympic Qualifying tournament holding between January 22 and 26 in Gondomar, Portugal. Listed for the 18 teams made up of nine men and nine women expected to pick slots for the 2020 Olympics, are Aruna Quadri, Olajide Omotayo, Segun Toriola, Bode Abiodun and Taiwo Mati, Edem Offiong, Olufunke Oshonaike, Fatimo Bello, Ajoke Ojomu and Cecilia Akpan. According to the ITTF, the playing format will involve matches in the knockout stages, with the first stage made up of a knockout of 64. Eight teams that qualify for the quarterfinals will automatically scale through to the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games. However, matches in the quarterfinals, semifinals and final will now be a mere formality, as it will not be played. The ninth and final qualification place for both men and women’s teams will be determined through a second knockout stage between teams that lose in the round of 16 of the first stage. The matches are best of five individual matches consisting of doubles and four singles. Nigeria had lost the continental sole ticket for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics to Egypt at last year’s African Games in Morocco.
