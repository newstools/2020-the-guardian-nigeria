Bilabiri community residents, whose houses and properties were burnt and destroyed during Friday’s military invasion, have sent a Save-Our-Soul message to the federal and state governments. The predominantly Ijaw settlement in Ekeremor Local Government, Bayelsa State, was razed by military men in retaliation for the killing of four naval personnel by unknown gunmen. Speaking on their ordeal, the Chairman, Alabini Rural Development Area (RDA), Frank Seide, whose house was among those razed, condemned the military action. He described it as an action taken too far, calling on the Federal Government to take steps to address displaced persons’ suffering. He said: “It is unfortunate that things in the Niger Delta are always taken too far. As a community and people, we condemned the military invasion of Bilabiri communities, just as we condemned the heinous crime of some of our disgruntled youths.” Also, Ijaw Youth Council (IYC), Central Zone, condemned the attack on Bilabiri. Chairman of the Zone, Olorogun Kennedy, lamented the continuous display of uncivilized and unprofessional acts by the Nigerian Military towards Ijaw people. Meanwhile, military authorities have kept mute, as repeated calls and text messages to both the spokespersons of the Central Naval Command and the Joint Task Force, were unanswered.
