Plateau State Government has said that negotiation with labour unions for the implementation of the N30,000 minimum wage in the state is a must. The Commissioner of Information and Communication, Dan Manjang, told newsmen in Jos yesterday that significant progress had been made through the negotiation. Manjang described the stage of negotiation with labour as peaceful and encouraging. “I want to put the record straight to the citizens of Plateau that this government is committed to the welfare of its workers and will do all it could to achieve that at all costs,” he assured. The commissioner appealed to workers and the unions to “remain calm while negotiations are on and pending the recommendation of the same.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
