Earlier, the Programme and Camp Coordinator for Gurku IDP Camp, Mr Bulus Garba, commended DEPOWA for the gesture while briefing them on the history of the camp. Garba disclosed that the camp, which was inaugurated on May 12, 2015 started with 62 houses that housed not less than 100 families. He commended NGOs such as faith based organisations, community development organisations, and other government organisations for their support for the camp by making it a community. “We are happy to have you in our midst today and we appreciate your humanitarian visit to this camp. “It is through this type of your visitation that we achieved what we have achieved here today. “When I learnt that you are coming here, I made a little research and I discovered that this is not just the first or the second or the third of such an activity that you have engaged yourself in. “Anywhere there is DEPOWA branch you are doing this humanitarian work and it is only God that will reward you and we the IDPs here welcome you with an open heart. “We pray that you will continue to grow from strength to strength and what you will be doing in future will not be just to come and donate relief materials but to empower people to live the lives they want to live,” he said.
