Notable dignitaries in the governor’s entourage are, his wife Betsy; Deputy Governor, Philip Shaibu; Secretary to the State Government, Osarodion Ogie; Chief of Staff to the governor, Taiwo Akerele; Chairman, Edo State Chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Anselm Ojezua, commissioners, special advisers and heads of agencies, among others. Oba Akiolu said Edo and Lagos share a lot in common, noting that his forebears traced their ancestry to Benin Kingdom, adding that it would only be proper for the two states to work together for their mutual development and growth.On the APC political impasse in the state, he said there was the need for a truce that would be beneficial for all, noting, “Politicians don’t quarrel, they only disagree to agree later. “The friction must end on a peaceful note. No victor, no vanquished, as I have told my son here. What is paramount is this country is development and advancement.” Responding, Obaseki said he and his team visited Lagos to hold a Town Hall meeting with Edo indigenes in the state, saying, “We cannot come here without coming to pay courtesies and obeisance to you. We are also here to say thank you for the fatherly love and support you have given us. “Since I became governor, you have visited Edo twice. Each time, you have been full of prayers for us. We want to tell them what we have done in the last three years and also seek their support, as we move forward.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
