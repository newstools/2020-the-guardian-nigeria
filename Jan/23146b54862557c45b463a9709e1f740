Kano State Governor Umar Ganduje on Wednesday filed a fresh application challenging the jurisdiction of the court to entertain the suit by Kano Concern Elders against the creation of new Emirates. In a preliminary objection filed by Kano state Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Ibrahim Muktar, before the chief judge of Kano state, Justice Nura Sagir, Ganduje also insisted that the Kano elders lack credence to represent 20 million residents of the state. The Kano Concern Elders, under the leadership of defunct National Republican Convention (NRC) presidential candidate, Bashir Tofa, former speaker, house of representatives, Umar Ghali Naâ€™abba and 19 others are challenging the enactment of the new Kano Emirate Council Law, 2019. Justice Nura had on 13th December 2019, quashed exparte order filed by the concern elders, asking the applicants to rather turn in an application for motion on notice.
