Aviation unions have vowed to deploy all means possible to recover a missing document that earlier approved a 30 per cent Duty Tour Allowance (DTA) at the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA). The additional pay, it was learned, was being approved by the former Director-General (DG). But the file had gone missing since the DG left office last November. The Chairman of the Air Transport Services Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (ATSSSAN), NCAA branch, Shofolahan Ayodele, told his members recently that the Incomes, Salaries, and Wages Commission, during their visit, disclosed that what they were collecting as local running was not up to what they were expected to collect. Ayodele said the workers were eligible to 30 per cent of their DTA following a letter to the former DG, who gave approval for the collection. He expressed displeasure that the approval file disappeared following the removal of the DG. “Till today, we can’t find the file. It has disappeared. I do not know if they have kept the file with you (co-workers). “If it is with you, please bring it out because we are going to pray against those holding that file this year. That file must come out because the former DG approved it,” Ayodele said. On the promotion of members, the ATSSSAN Chairman said 60 per cent of it had been resolved based on vacancies, adding that the issue of the condition of service still lingers but hopeful of a quick redress.
