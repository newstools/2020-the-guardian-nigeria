Turkey has sent military aid to Libya’s UN-recognised Government of National Accord (GNA), whose fighters have been at war since last April with forces loyal to military strongman Khalifa Haftar. Algiers, for its part, has taken on a role as mediator and last week hosted a meeting of Libya’s neighbours that rejected “any foreign interference” and called for a negotiated settlement.
