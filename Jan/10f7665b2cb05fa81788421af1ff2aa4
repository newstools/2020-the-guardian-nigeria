 Uche Nwosu  In statement issued by party’s spokesperson, Jones Onwuasoanya, yesterday, the party said it was delighted to receive back to its fold Araraume’s counterpart in the Action Alliance (AA), Uche Nwosu, and his supporters. The party also cautioned against any ploy aimed at destabilising efforts made towards ensuring healthy reconciliation of party members and moving the party forward in the state.It further stated that it would soon commence contempt proceedings against Marcellinus Nlemigbo, factional chairman of the party in the state, “for his continuous impersonation as the state chairman.” The statement read in part: “His Excellency, Ugwumba Uche Nwosu, returned to the party with his numerous supporters across the 305 wards in the state and these valuable party members have been welcomed back into the party and fully reabsorbed.“The party is hopeful that other critical leaders of our party from across the state, who left the party due to one reason or the other will soon rejoin the party, even as we look forward with hope to the Supreme Court judgment on the Imo governorship election. “We must commend His Excellency, Senator Ifeanyi Araraume, for his support to the APC candidate for the Okigwe North Federal Constituency and we look forward to welcoming him and his numerous supporters back to our party as soon as possible.“We also urge members of our party at all levels not to lend themselves as tools of destabilisation against our party, but to key into the new spirit of reconciliation and healings ongoing in our party across the nation. “We must however not fail to bring the law to bear against anyone or group of people found to have willfully constituted himself or themselves to a nuisance and a clog in the wheels of cohesion, progress and discipline in our party. “To this effect, the party shall commence contempt proceedings against Chief Marcellinus Nlemigbo and his gang of PDP moles for their several acts of disobedience against court orders, including his contemptuous reference to a valid court order as fake.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
