The Federal Government has again slammed a new charge on clearing agents and freight forwarders operating at Nigeria’s seaports, tagged: “Practitioners Operating Fee”, to shore up its Internally Generated Revenue (IGR).
 
The Practitioners Operating Fee, otherwise known as POF, is a compulsory payment for all clearing agents and freight forwarders before being able to evacuate any container from the seaports.Under the POF regime, practitioners are expected to pay N1,000 on a 20ft container and N2,000 on a 40ft container coming through the seaports.
   
The Registrar, Council for the Regulation of Freight Forwarders of Nigeria (CRFFN), Samuel Nwakohu, in a chart with journalists yesterday, said the fee would take off “any moment from now” at the seaports, while the airports would follow suit in a not-too-distant future.  Nwakohu said the money would be spent to train practitioners, solve inherent problems in the system, and guard against threats.On the POF increasing the cost of doing business at the ports, he said the fee would rather reduce cost, because it would spent on train of clearing agents and freight forwarders, who, hitherto, would need to engage the services of a professional to handle the digital operational system, thereby saving them cost.
