Ehwariemi, a native of Oghara, Delta State won the WBF Intercontinental title at GOtv Boxing Night 20, which took place at the Tafawa Balewa Square, Lagos, on Saturday. The Nigerian boxer said he was delighted at winning the Intercontinental heavyweight belt, but added that his attention has now shifted to winning the vacant WBF world title. “It was great to win the title at home,” Ehwarieme said: “it was very special. However, I now have to concentrate on winning the WBF world heavyweight title. It is currently vacant and my intercontinental title win has now made me a contender for the world title. So, I am intensifying my preparations to ensure I get the biggest prize in the weight division,” he said.
He told The Guardian yesterday that his team was already working on the possibility of fighting for the world title within three months. Ehwarieme thanked GOtv Boxing Night for staging the intercontinental heavyweight title fight and providing him the opportunity to win the title at home. He also thanked Nigerians for coming out en masse to support him, promising them that he would make the country proud by winning the world title.
