No fewer than two persons were reportedly killed in Kwarafara village of Gassol Local Council of Taraba State on Friday The attack also led to massive destruction of property, as over 100 houses and valuables worth millions of naira were set ablaze, while residents also fled to nearby villages. The killings were said to have been carried out by hundreds of gunmen, who stormed the village, while the people were asleep and began to shoot sporadically. The action led to the death of two persons while several others were injured. Former Special Assistant to the State Governor, Jerry Tyolanga, a resident, confirmed the incident. Kwarafar village, in recent time, has known no peace following the decision of the state government to change the name of the village from Dananacha to Kwararafa. The situation had also led to a face-off between two major ethnic groups of the community, leading to breakdown of law and order in the area. The attackers were said to have operated for over three hours uninterrupted, as the joint security forces assigned to keep vigil in the community were said to have taken to their heels. Though normalcy seems to have returned to the community following the massive deployment of heavily armed soldiers, convincing the fleeing residents to come back has proven to be a daunting task, as the people claimed they had lost confidence in the security operatives.
