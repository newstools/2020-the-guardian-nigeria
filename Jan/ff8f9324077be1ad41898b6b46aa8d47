There was tension and unrest in Aiyegbaju-Ekiti, Oye local government area of Ekiti State yesterday after a fast-moving vehicle killed an okada rider and his passenger at about 2:30 p.m. between Ifaki and Aiyegbaju-Ekiti. An eyewitness said the vehicle, which was on top speed, rammed into the two persons and crushed them to death. The driver of the vehicle escaped from the scene but voluntarily surrendered himself at the nearest police station. “The driver was said to have escaped for fear of being attacked by residents. He is being detained at the police station where he went to”. However, following the incident, some irate youths in the community took to the streets to protest against the persistent killings of their loved ones, saying it is becoming unbearable.
According to them, “the community had lost so many loved ones to accidents along the route, which were as a result of the recklessness of road users”. In order to show their grievances, the people barricaded the major route in the community, which hampered free flow of traffic, thereby subjecting motorists to hardship. When contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer, Ekiti Command, Mr. Sunday Abutu, said the victims were confirmed dead at the hospital, adding that the suspect is being detained at the Ado Ekiti police headquarters. Abutu stated that the police had been able to calm down the rampaging youths, who expressed disapproval over incessant killing of their members in recent time. “The two victims died after they were overrun by the vehicle driven by a university student. Though there was protest but we have been able to bring it under control”. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
