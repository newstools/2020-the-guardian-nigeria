Photo: TWITTER/VICTORMOSES  Moses, 29, played under Conte when the Italian was in charge of Chelsea and has already expressed positive opinion on the transfer and wants an immediate move to Inter. Fenerbahce, the club at which the Nigeria international is currently on loan, will not stand in the player’s way in moving to Italy. According to Sky Sport Italia, the African winger will return to Chelsea to be immediately loaned out to Inter until June for no cost. Inter have already made it known that they will not make a permanent move for Moses this month, but could revisit the situation in the summer if they deem him to have successfully adapted to Conte’s 3-5-2 formation. A fee of €10million (£8.5m) has been mooted as the figure which Inter will have to pay if they wish to acquire the player on a permanent basis in June. The Italian coach knows Moses very well and impressed Conte ahead of the 2016-17 season for which he was rewarded with a regular spot at Chelsea in the wing-back role. The duo then went on to win the FA Cup in 2018 after beating Manchester United in the final at Wembley. Moses has only made six appearances for Fenerbahce this season but should he join Inter, he would follow Alexis Sanchez and Romelu Lukaku in leaving the Premier League for Serie A. In Chelsea colours, Moses has played 78 games, scoring eight goals and assisting 8 times in the last 24 months. Antonio Conte has been incredibly active this month in the market and Moses may not be the last of this January market. Chief among those targets are Tottenham and Denmark midfielder Christian Eriksen and Chelsea and France forward Olivier Giroud. However, while Jose Mourinho insists that Spurs have received no offer for Eriksen, the Serie A side is believed to be confident about signing the Premier League pair.
