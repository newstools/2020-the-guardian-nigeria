Nigeriaâ€™s Supreme Court has postponed the hearing of the Kano State governorship election appeal. The Chief Justice of Nigeria, Tanko Muhammed, announced that judgment of the Kano State governorship appeal is to be delivered on January 20. However, the apex court has begun hearing of the governorship appeals from five other states. They are those of Imo, Bauchi, Sokoto, Plateau and Benue States. The governors returned elected by the independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in the March 9 polls include Emeka Ihedioha (Imo), Bala Mohammed (Bauchi), Aminu Tambuwal (Sokoto), Simon Lalong (Plateau), and Samuel Ortom (Benue). The different appeals before the apex court were filed on different dates by the various aggrieved candidates.
