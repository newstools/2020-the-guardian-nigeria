Determined to create an enabling environment for learning, Vice-Chancellor, University of Benin(UNIBEN), Prof Lilian Salami, has embarked on people’s oriented projects in the institution’s campuses. The projects include, renovation works on hostels, provision of water and adequate security among others.At a media parley in Benin, Public Relations Officer of the institution, Benedicta Ehanire, said students of the University of Benin who resumed for the 2019/2020 session were greeted with the improved hostel infrastructure. When The Guardian visited some of the hostels within Ugbowo and Ekenwan campuses, it was observed that street lights have been restored, grasses cleared while there are steady water and power supply in the hostels. Also, at Queen Idia hostel, a 200 level student of the Department of Optometry, Sarah Aideyan lauded the Vice-Chancellor, for making student’s welfare a priority. Again, Plant Biology and Biotechnology student, Precious Osagie, expressed appreciation to the Vice-Chancellor for the tremendous changes that have taken place within the short period of her assumption of office. The Guardian also observed that the conveniences within the hostels have been fixed while there have been replacements of worn-out plumbing materials. The Ekenwan campus which was almost in ruins was experiencing a facelift. It would be recalled that Salami’s administration came on board in December, and commenced renovations in Ugbowo campus since the first week of January.Also, a 200-Level student simply identified as Osahumen showered encomium on the Vice-Chancellor for addressing the issue of power outage on campus.He noted there was a great improvement in the area of power because the students now have six to eight hours of electricity every day.“All the giant grasses have been cleared. We now enjoy snakes and rodent-free environment, he added.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
