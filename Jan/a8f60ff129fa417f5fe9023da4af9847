Daniel Ikechukwu, popularly known as The Pancake Boy, is a dynamic student, artist, lover of music and football, aspiring paediatrician and foodprenuer. Daniel grew up in a family of eight. And as the last child, he spent most of his time doing chores and helping his mum in the kitchen. This exposure built in him the culture of diligence, discipline and respect for authority. At age 10, Daniel developed affection for homemade pancakes, after tasting it at a family friend’s house. Little did he know that this unusual fondness for homemade pancakes would be the genesis of his entrepreneurial voyage. Daniel’s first apprentice was his mother, whom he taught to make pancakes. Daniel would always make and take pancakes for breakfast before going to school each day. His first trials were a waste of flour, but Daniel never gave up. The journey to starting his own business began in 2019, when Daniel accompanied his elder brother to a business seminar for young people, where he heard words that awakened his interest in business. And though at first his pancake idea was totally weird to his family members, as they thought it was a waste of resources, but in no time, the whole family was craving and queuing up for Daniel’s pancakes because of the taste and quality. But Daniel didn’t stop there. He later launched his business with faith, a capital of N1, 000 and his family’s support. In the course of selling his pancakes, he had run into a social media influencer, Pamilerin Adegoke, who admired his courage and the quality of his products. Pamilerin promoted him online and with that, Danicious Foods was birthed. Today, Daniel delivers his mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes to offices and homes across Lagos State. He has had several appearances on radio (Metro FM and on Stars Of Tomorrow (S.O.T) show on Cool FM with DK and DY sharing his pancake story that has inspired adults and kids alike. He also had the opportunity of exhibiting his business alongside 50+ kid entrepreneurs at the KIDBIZ FAIR 2019 organised by KIDPRENEUR AFRICA. At age 12, Daniel began reading books that would shape his mind. Many of them were gifts from his big brother. Daniel also started attending seminars and workshop. This way, he began to understand how life works. Daniel’s vision is to expand his business, making it Nigeria’s number one supplier of homemade pancakes, tea, juice and drinks, delivered to the doorstep. He also plans to train other kids, helping them to explore their potential, especially in business. Daniel is currently developing himself, so he can be the best, both as a student and an entrepreneur. He dreams to become an exceptional kid by writing a bestselling book about his success story, give to charity, speak on many platforms and helping young kids to defy the odds, overcome fear, be bold and live courageously. His advice to other kids is to be hard working, focused and dogged. “When we are bold and are willingly to take acceptable risks, mighty forces will come right to our aid,” he said. • From KidpreneursAfrica: kidpreneursafrica1@gmail.com To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
