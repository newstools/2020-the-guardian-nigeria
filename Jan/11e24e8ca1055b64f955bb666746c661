Just when many had strated asking of hiw whereabouts, reggae music legend Andy Shurman is back with a comeback album, Stop The Oppressors. The singer, whose evergreen track, Kinky Reggaeman, ruled the Nigerian airwaves in the 80s, is here to bring back old memories. In recent media chat to herald the album, which is expected to drop next month, Shurman, who dominated the airwaves in the 80s with his debut album, Save the Masses, said he wants to use his music to fight against the prevailing social injustice in the country. “I have said it from the out set that I would always speak the truth. I have neither gun nor a knife; my music is my weapon. Through my music, I will fight for freedom; I will fight for what is right as a prophet of this generation. I will make sure that we are dishing out great philosophical and provocative songs,” he assured. The reggae star said he’s disappointed with events in the country, adding, “We have derailed as a country from the dreams of our forefathers, which had nothing to do with killing of innocent people, marginalisation and corruption in high places.” Shurman, who held sway in 80s alongside the likes of late Ras Kimono, the Mandators, Majek Fashek, Orits Wiliki and others, said he decided to return home because Nigerians need music of reality to confront the dicey situation they found themselves. “They also need to hear the truth and reggae musicians are like prophets; we tell the government only but the truth,” he said. A prodigious songwriter and self-acclaimed advocate of the masses, Shurman’s sold out debut album, Save the Masses, which was released in 1989, has tracks such as Kinky Reggaeman, Tabefaction, Oladi, Judgment Day, Let them Rise, My Creator, No Train and Fight Them Back. He left the shores of this country when the ovation was loudest, and after sojourning in the United States, Canada and Germany for close to a decade, the veteran singer returned home last year to claim his spot once more.
