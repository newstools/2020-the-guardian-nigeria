 Nigerian Communications Commission  The Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Pantami, has insisted that data tariff in the country will be reviewed downward. Pantami said this is necessary to ensure that more Nigerians have access to affordable and ubiquitous Internet, and broadband services in the country.
   
As at November, there were over 240 million connected lines, with 178 million active telephone users, while there are 123 million Internet users, and about 70 million broadband subscribers in the country. It would be recalled that in October and November 2019, at a meeting in Abuja, the minister handed a directive to the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) to ensure that telecoms operators slashed data tariffs, based on claims that subscribers pay huge sums to be online.
  
In fact, the minister gave NCC five-days to effect the review, but the directive ended up sparking diverse reactions across the country, especially among operators, while subscribers were ecstatic. Some subscribers, who commented on the development on the social media, described Pantami as the ‘messiah.’  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
