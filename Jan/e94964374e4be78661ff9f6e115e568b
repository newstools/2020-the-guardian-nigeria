Imo State governor-elect Hope Uzodinma has ordered all financial institutions in custody of the state funds not to honour any pay-out draft from the government accounts until further notice. Uzodinma gave the order in a letter by the director-general of his campaign organisation Cosmos Iwu hours after the Supreme Court declared him the duly elected governor of the state on Tuesday. “Following the Supreme Court judgment of 14, January 2020, I am directed by his excellency, Senator Hope Uzodinma, to take this as your authority/instruction to place a post no debit order on all accounts of the Imo state government maintained in your various institutions,” Iwu said. “You are by this letter directed to comply and await further instructions from the office of his excellency, the executive governor of Imo state.” Uzodinma was declared as the legitimate winner of the Imo State governorship election on Tuesday by the Supreme Court. The court held that the lower court erred in law when it rejected evidence tendered before it that votes due to from 388 polling units were not credited to APC and Uzodinma. The court also ordered the immediate swearing-in of Uzodinma as the lawful winner of the March 9, 2019 governorship election in Imo State. Consequently, the court sacked Emeka Ihedioha, who was declared the winner of the election by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in March 2019.
