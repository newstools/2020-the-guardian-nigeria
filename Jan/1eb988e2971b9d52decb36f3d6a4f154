This is according to the United Kingdom Digital Minister, Matt Warman, as quoted by UK’s Department for Digital Culture, Media and Sport, on Monday, at the first-ever UK-Africa Investment Summit in London.
  
The UK’s Department, while inviting African tech firms to join the UK-led growth project, through the Go Global Africa, said the plan would enable them to take their businesses and ideas to the next level.
