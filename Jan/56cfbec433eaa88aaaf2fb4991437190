Justice Sikiru Oyinloye of the Kwara State High Court, Ilorin has issued a warrant of arrest against a Lagos-based businessman, Isiaka Jimoh, following his failure to answer criminal charges preferred against him by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). The EFCC had arraigned Jimoh and his company, Chemtech Chemicals Limited in September last year on a two-count charge of obtaining N155m under false pretence. At resumed sitting yesterday, defence counsel, Adeola Omotunde urged the court to vacate the proceeding and adjourn the cross-examination of the prosecution witness, as the defendant was ill and was flown abroad on December 20, 2019. Prosecuting counsel, Christopher Mschelia, however, argued that the defendant violated his bail conditions, which stipulated that he should be available for trial, and urged the court to revoke the bail and issue a bench warrant against him, which Oyinloye granted.
