Rapper Andre Johnson, popularly known as Christ Bearer, associated with legendary hip-hop collective the Wu-Tang Clan has tied the knots in an intimate ceremony. According to reports, Johnson had been dating his bride, Cheryl, for six months, though they were friends long before that. Even though fans and well-wishers are excited about his new marital journey, it can’t but bring up the incident that occurred over five years ago when he cut off his own penis in a drug-fueled breakdown. He had previously told the Daily News that he was ‘high on PCP on April 16, 2014 when he severed his genitals with a knife after reading extensively about monks and vasectomies’. He then jumped from the second-story balcony of his North Hollywood condo. Despite the dramatic exit, he has denied that it was a suicide attempt. “By no means was I trying to kill myself. I was under the influence of PCP. It’s a drug that I had stopped doing for years, but I just got back from Ohio and got back into that lifestyle for a few days. It definitely was not wise,” he told the outlet later that year. “I was so happy to wake up in the hospital.” Johnson was a member of the rap group Northstar, who used to record with fellow Californian group Black Knights as Black Knights Of The North Star and indeed the two groups were initially signed by RZA as such to Wu-Tang Records. Even though the groups have since split into two separate units, Northstar released their debut album in 2003, titled Bobby Digital Presents Northstar, which also featured a reunion with Black Knights on the closing song “Black Knights Of The North Star”. In 1999, the duo appeared on the soundtrack to the film Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai. Their second album West Coast Killa Beez was released in 2005. A third album followed in 2008. They began introducing their own sub groups in 2011.
