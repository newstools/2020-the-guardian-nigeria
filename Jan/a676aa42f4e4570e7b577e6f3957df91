Civil servants have commended Federal Government for keeping to its promise to pay the arrears of the new minimum wage, which became effective in April 2019.
 
The government workers expressed excitement that the arrears came at the time they needed it most, as it added colour to their Yuletide celebrations, with more money in their pockets to feast with.
 
Some of them who spoke with The Guardian said the bulk money was an avenue to meet some major demands.  “I want to use this opportunity to commend the Federal Government for this money. It is not easy because some government will promise and will not fulfill their promise. “It shows that the government has the interest of civil servants at heart. I hope they will continue this way in addressing issues concerning civil servants, kudos to them,” he said.
   
For another civil servant, Mrs Cynthia Eyitayo, the money will help reduce the burden on her children’s school fees as they resume. 
   
“The money came at the right time. Initially, I never wanted to buy my kids clothes, I had planned on clean ones they would put on on New Year day, but on receiving the alert, I quickly made withdrawals to get them new clothes to make them happy.” 
 
However, another civil servant, Innocent Okafor, criticised the amount that was paid him. He said the amount added to his salary as the new minimum wage was nothing to write home about.
   
“All the minimum wage they are making noise about for over two years is nothing to write home about. The amount added to my take-home is just a slight difference, which to me makes no sense. It is only those at the top level that will enjoy the difference,” he said. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
