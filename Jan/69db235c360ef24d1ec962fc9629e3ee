The Governor Udom Emmanuel administration has restated its commitment to the completion of the Ibom deep seaport in Akwa Ibom State. The Commissioner for Economic Development and Ibom Deep Seaport, Akan Okon, who briefed reporters yesterday in Uyo, commended the efforts of the technical committee towards the actualisation of the project, adding: “Government cannot do it alone, more hands are still needed to make this project a success.” According to him, the seaport when completed would not only improve the economy of the state but also create more employment opportunities for Akwa Ibomites. He implored the indigenes to acquire requisite skills to enable them to play actively in the project when completed. The commissioner gave an update on the facility, noting that 20 of the 22 checklists needed for the take-off of the port had been achieved, expressing optimism that with the cooperation from the Federal Government, the project would be a reality. He allayed conflict in revenue management, stating that the Nigerian Port Authority (NPA) had been saddled with the responsibility of collecting revenue to avoid anything untoward. “In terms of revenue, it is the Nigerian Port Authority that is saddled with the responsibility of collecting revenue. The Deep Seaport will be the world, not a state project when completed. So, the issue of conflict in revenue mobilisation would not occur,” Okon promised.
