Coach of Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries Football Club (MFM FC), Tony Bolus, has expressed his team’s willpower to beat league leaders, Plateau United in tomorrow’s encounter in order to stay relevant in this season’s quest for success. Today’s fixture, a match day 17 of the Nigeria Professional Football League, will hold at the Temple Stadium in Agege, Lagos, with supporters of both clubs rooting for a win to either remain on top of the log or sustain the quest to be among the NPFL’s contenders. With 15 games played and one outstanding, the Olukoya Boys are on eighth position, after amassing 22 points, having won six matches, suffered six defeats and drawn four. The Abdu Maikaba’s boys, who are topping the league with 28 points, have won eight games, drawn four and lost four. Speaking to The Guardian yesterday today’s battle, Coach Bolus said his club couldn’t afford to be left behind except by securing the three maximum points. “I want to believe my boys had taken the top flight league by surprise this season. The owner of the club had expressed worries over the numbers of established players who left MFM and we embarked on recruiting new players who the owner described as ‘rookies’. “And I told him that the rookies were going to surprise Nigerians, which is actually happening now. Our survival in the league had been through hard work, determination and discipline in the team. “Every match of the NPFL has been tough, but against Plateau we want to capitalise on the home front to beat them,” he said, adding that a win would give them the impetus to uphold their resolve to win every of their home games henceforth. Meanwhile, in other games across the country, Lobi Stars, currently second, have the chance to top the league if they beat Nasarawa and Plateau United lose to MFM.
