EROCKFOR (aka ROCKY) is out with her latest single, “Questions,” in which she questions everything about living a ‘normal’ life to the gentle, yet firm beats of blues music. Based in Seoul, South Korea, EROCKFOR is a genre-blurring Cameroonian singer-songwriter born and raised in Montreal, Canada, who mixes jazz and soul, with hip hop and reggae to create sound tastemakers have called exciting and unique. Erockfor released her first single “How Will I Know” in October to rave reviews, and the accompanying music video premiered on Popdust late December 2019. For the coming year, Erockfor has set her aims high. Now well set in the Seoul music scene after 18 months, she will be releasing a new single every month during the year, with the view of garnering a global audience. Her music has begun to draw critics’ attention, who have compared her with greats such as Nina Simone, Erykah Badu, Billie Holiday and Cindy Lauper, as well as Janelle Monae and Macy Gray. Her new offering “QUESTIONS” is her second release, with a third one coming at the end of February. Produced by Defnelson and written by Rocky herself, the single’s blues influence is palpable. The chorus, however, veers into the realm of Afrobeat. She lends to the important message her raspy jazz vocals, creating a mood of rebellion, ditching the rules, and marching to the beat of your own drum. It’s the perfect anthem for the New Year.  Speaking about the inspiration for “Questions”, she told Lambo Xtra, “So many people and society at large want to pressure us into following a set path. Get married. Get a mortgage. Have two kids. Get a “real” job. Those things can be great, but we all have to make decisions that will make us happy in the long run. “It’s so easy to compare ourselves to others thanks to social media. My message is to stay in your lane, explore your individuality and bloom, fudging all expectations besides your own,” says Erockfor.
