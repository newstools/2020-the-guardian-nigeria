World wrestling bronze medalist, Oduanyo Adekuoroye, Blessing Oborodudu, Amina Adeniyi, Mercy Genesis and Blessing Oyebuchi alongside Coach Purity Akuh will today storm Rome, Italy the 2020 World Ranking Series Events holding between today and 19. President of Nigeria Wrestling Federation (NWF), Daniel Igali told The Guardian yesterday that the trip was part of the preparations for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics in Japan in August.He added that the event was a ranking series tournament where the wrestlers could get ranked for the Olympics and avoid tough opponents until the semifinal stage of the wrestling event. “Five wrestlers that include Oduanyo Adekuoroye, Blessing Oborodudu, Amina Adeniyi, Mercy Genesis, Blessing Oyebuchi and Coach Purity Akuh will be departing for Italy tomorrow (today) for the world ranking series tournament.  “This is part of the training for the Olympics, and it is also a world ranking series tournament. The athletes are going to be there till January 19th. It is a tournament where any point they score will count towards their rankings at the Olympics. “What that means is that the top four ranked wrestlers don’t get to meet one another until the semifinals. So, our goal is to ensure we have a couple of athletes ranked in the top four so that they don’t meet the top ranked wrestlers until the semifinals in Tokyo,” Igali stated. Meanwhile, Igali has disclosed that the sports ministry is directly involved in Adekuoroye’s adopt-an-athlete campaign initiative programme with Halogen, an effort geared towards funding the athlete for the Tokyo Olympics.“The ministry is dealing with them directly because the federation has very little to do with that. Also, the last time I spoke with the ministry, they also inquired about the other wrestlers. I am sure there is something they are doing concerning them also,” he stated.
