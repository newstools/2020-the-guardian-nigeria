With the proposed review of the country’s labour laws, the Trade Union Congress of Nigeria (TUC), has raised an alarm over attempts by some interests to remove labour-related issues from the exclusive legislative list.
   
While appreciating the need to review existing laws to suit the current realities in the world of work, TUC warned that the Congress will resist attempts by some interested quarters to remove such labour-related issues from the exclusive legislative list.
   
The President of TUC, Quadri Olaleye, gave the warning during the union’s National Executive Council Meeting (NEC), in Lagos.
Among other issues, the union said it will not guarantee industrial peace and harmony in states, which are yet to commence implementation of the N30,000 new minimum wage/consequential adjustments by January 31st.  The Union also condemned all forms of casualisation and slave labour in Nigeria, and vowed to engage any employer that violates the right of Nigerian workers to unionise and have permanent employment.Additionally, the union advised government to extend the existing local content policy in the oil sector to other sectors of the economy.
