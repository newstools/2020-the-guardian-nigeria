Kim Kardashian West is a step closer to becoming a lawyer, having finished her first year of study as an apprentice. The reality TV star told The Associated Press on Saturday (Jan. 18) that her next step is taking the “baby bar,” so-called because it’s a one-day exam. If she passes, she plans to study for another three years and then take the California bar exam. “I’m super-motivated, and I really want to see it through,” she said in an interview after promoting a television documentary on criminal justice reform. “There’s obviously times where I’m overwhelmed and stressed and feel like I have a lot on my plate. My kids know that I’m in school just like they are. It’s 20 hours a week, so it is a lot of my time.” Kim Kardashian West: The Justice Project airs April 5 on Oxygen. The two-hour documentary shows her being visibly moved by prison inmates recounting their stories of landing behind bars. She talks to their families and friends, lobbies public officials and consults with their attorneys as well as her own. It features four cases, including a sex trafficking victim and a woman who murdered the family member who molested her. Each of them believes they received unfair sentences; two of them end up being released. Kardashian West began advocating for criminal justice reform after helping Alice Marie Johnson, a great-grandmother serving life plus 25-year sentence as a first-time non-violent drug offender. Kardashian West took Johnson’s case all the way to a White House meeting with President Donald Trump, who granted Johnson clemency in 2018.
