A group, Oodua Action Movement, has called for an autonomous state of Yorubaland, urging the United Nations (UN), United States (U.S.), African Union (AU), European Union (EU), the Group of Seven (G-7) and other international institutions to come to the rescue. The group, in a statement signed by its Co-ordinator, Demola Edward, noted that the Yoruba nation, as an ethnic of over 40 million people, should be able to manage its resources. Edward urged President Muhammadu Buhari to begin the process for an autonomous Yoruba nation as a federating unit in Nigeria, as granted the South-West region upon independence in 1960. He said: “As citizens in Diaspora, having watched the trend of events in Nigeria from the sidelines over the years and especially the current spate of insecurity of lives and property and the continued degeneration of the country, we have unequivocally concluded that the country with its present structure is in a state of irredeemable rot. “Nigeria is now in the infamous league of failed nations.
From the foregoing, it is obvious that the present unitary structure of Nigeria has significantly inhibited the country’s growth and prospects. “We demand an autonomous state for Yorubaland. The Yoruba people claim and demand our rights to self-determination; our rights to autonomously govern our region and manage our resources and own our destiny. “The Oodua Action Movement, on behalf of Yoruba worldwide, is relentlessly committed to this cause. We are prepared to use all legal and peaceful means within the confines of international laws and norms to actualise an autonomous nation for Yoruba people within Nigeria.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
