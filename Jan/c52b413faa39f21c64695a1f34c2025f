The Kings University, Ode Omu, Osun State, was agog with more than 21,000 thousand widows who trooped out as beneficiaries of the Mathew and Yemisi Ashimolowo’s annual widows party. The 14th edition of the programme, which also commemorated Yemisi Ashimolowo’s 60 birthday, saw the beneficiaries gifted clothing, food and money as part of yuletide celebration. Speaking at the event, Ashimolowo, who is the General Overseer of the Kings International Christian Centre (KICC), said: “I am now 46 years in ministry so I have seen it all. I went to Bible school in January 2, 1974 and because of what I have seen around the country, I cannot afford to preach only, we need to touch people in a physical way and at the same time, teach people the principles of catching fish. “Church is not just about where we preach about heaven, we should also teach people how to be relevant in Nigeria, how to break through and make a difference in their community and their country. I am also loking forward to not just Ode Omu town because we want to hold crusades, which will be distribution of clothes, food and other poverty alleviating materials four times a year in different parts of the country.” He continued, “It will now be a Christian evangelical group that does not just say, repent or perish, no, we will give food, clothes, relieve materials and then pray for the sick, we will also provide medicine.”Giving insight to what happened during their recent outreach in Zimbabwe, Ashimolowo said: “We just did that in Zimbabwe where we gave out 8,000 bags of food a family can eat for a week and we carried 40-foot container of clothing, which took four days to distribute.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
