The Nigerian College of Aviation Technology (NCAT), Zaria, will next month receive six new Diamond training aircraft recently purchased by the Federal Government.The scheduled arrival was confirmed after the Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika, inspected the new equipment in Austria, at the weekend.The aircraft arrival will also be followed by the delivery of the long-awaited Boeing 737-NG Full Flight Simulator (FFS) from Montreal, Canada, in March.
  
The simulator, erstwhile planned for Lagos, will now arrive in Zaria to boost training capacity and capability of the college.It is noteworthy that schedule operators in Nigeria use more of Boeing aircraft, hence, the viability of the simulator.
  
Sirika at the aircraft inspection in Austria, said the huge investment were part of the efforts to catch up with evolving technology in line with the approved roadmap for development of the local sector.He recalled that similar effort lately earned Zaria the status of International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) Regional Training of Centre of Excellence.
