An unidentified driver of a Toyota Camry car has reportedly knocked down a Marshal of Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) in order to escape arrest in Sagamu area of Ogun State. In a statement yesterday by the Public Relations Officer (PRO) of the FRSC, Route Commander, Florence Okpe, hinted that the driver with the Toyota Camry ash colour with registration number KRD836FT drove the car roughly so he could avoid being arrested by the FRSC team that had stopped him for violating traffic rules. Okpe added that the Marshal sustained bodily injuries and was rushed to the nearest hospital for medical treatment. She added that manhunt was launched which later led to the arrest of the fleeing driver. The statement read: “An incident occurred yesterday, January 7 at about 11:50a.m. around the Sagamu Interchange when n FRSC Marshal on duty was knocked down by a reckless driver who drove a Toyota Camry car Ash colour with registration number KRD836FT. “The arresting Marshal had stopped the vehicle who initially obeyed but in the process of attending to him, the driver just zoomed off and in that process brushed the arresting Marshal who sustained bodily injuries. A manhunt was quickly organized, which led to the arrest of the fleeing driver. The injured Marshal was rescued to Idera Hospital for medical attention, while the offending vehicle was taken into custody.” Meanwhile, the FRSC on Wednesday in Kano, confirmed that 12 persons died in a ghastly auto crash on  Wudil-Maiduguri road, in Gaya Local Government area of the state. According to the Public Relations Officer of the Kano Sector Command of FRSC, Kabiru Daura, 26 people were injured, comprising 19 male and five female adults. He said two vehicles, a Volkswagen Golf and a Hiace (Hummer) bus, with registration Number BBR 690 AA and KTG 467 YG, all commercial vehicles were heading from Azare to Kano, on the Kano-Maiduguri expressway with 38 passengers on board the vehicles. According to an eyewitness account, the accident occurred at Tsaida village, near Gaya town, in Gaya Local Government Area of Kano at about 11:20a.m. The FRSC spokesman said the bodies of the victims and those who sustained injuries have been rushed to Gaya General Hospital. Chairman of Gaya Local Government, Ahmed T, Abdullahi, who also confirmed the incident,
said: “The Local Government has already rendered support to the victims through treatment.” Also, about eight persons were allegedly killed in a car crash at a market in Ugep, Yakurr Local Government Area of Cross River State. The accident occurred on Tuesday at the weekly market day in the area when a Toyota Camry ran through shops, leaving three persons dead on the spot while five others died in the hospital. An eyewitness, Patrick Ofem, said the vehicle (registration number not seen) descended from a hilly junction in the afternoon after a brake failure and caused the worst havoc the community had ever faced with properties worth millions of naira destroyed. “A Toyota vehicle descended from the nearest junction (Ediba junction) into the market, which entered into people’s shops and destroyed properties and about 11 victims were recorded. Three of them died instantly, while the others were rushed to the hospital.” “While at the hospital, five persons later died, raising the death toll to eight. The Ugep people cried like never before, as they lamented to God for letting such calamity befall them in this new year,” Ofem said. When contacted via phone on Wednesday, the paramount ruler of Yakurr local government area, Obol Ofem Ubana Eteng, said only two persons died on the spot and several others sustained various degrees of injuries. “Two persons were reported dead and over seven others sustained various levels of injuries.
