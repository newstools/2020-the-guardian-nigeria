• Marks four years of rate stability, compliance 
In line with its mantra to provide professional services for foreign exchange transactions across the country, the Association of Bureaux de Change Operators of Nigeria (ABCON), is collaborating with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), and other relevant agencies to enhance members’ efficiency through capacity building for an effective foreign exchange (forex) market.
 
In efforts to boost effective forex operations, the group also said it plans to evaluate the outcome of the assessment of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), Inter-Governmental Action Group Against Money Laundering in West Africa (GIABA), and CBN examinations.
   
At a sensitisation workshop on compliance for its members, President, ABCON, Dr. Aminu Gwadabe, said the Association has consistently advised operators to put in place and implement a system of internal policies, procedures and controls, including Know Your Customer, Customer Due Diligence and reporting of all suspicious transactions to regulators.
