Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe Wednesday asked Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari to resign over spike in insecurity in the country. “If you want to treat an issue, you go to the head. We did not appoint the IG or the security chiefs. We will go to the president and ask him to resign,” Abaribe said. Abaribe spoke after the Senate Leader, Yahaya Abdullahi,  presented his motion on rising security challenges in the country. Abaribe said he was surprised why the president will claim to be surprised at the rising insecurity in the country. He also called out the presidential media aide, Femi Adesina, for referring to the Christian Association of Nigeria as a political party for condemning killings by Boko Haram. “Those who live by propaganda will die by propaganda,” Abaribe said. However, while reacting to Abaribe’s motion, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, a member of the All Progressives Congress, said Abaribe’s submissions were unnecessary. The President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, also appealed to his colleagues to approach the issue with caution. The Red Chamber senators have set aside Wednesday to discuss security challenges in the country that have seen attacks by Boko Haram, kidnappers and so-called “bandits” increase, especially in the northern part of the country. On Tuesday, Mr Buhari said he was surprised at the growing insecurity, and said his government will be “harder” on bandits.
