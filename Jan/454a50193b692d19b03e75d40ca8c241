The Managing Director of Planet Projects in Lagos State, Mr. Biodun Otunola, yesterday disclosed that the Oshodi Transport Interchange had recorded 1.6 million passengers. Otunola, who stated this during the tour of the facility, said the passenger traffic was recorded in Terminal Three, which is currently in full operation, adding that Terminals one and two were set to take off in the first quarter of the year. Besides, Lagos State Commissioner for Information & Strategy, Mr. Gbenga Omotosho, who described the project as beautiful, said that although he saw the project when the foundation was laid, the outcome was commendable. According to him, the position of the Sanwo-olu administration is that all on-going projects must be completed to provide service to the people. Otunola said that the project’s viability would be determined by multiple streams of income, including ticketing, advertisement and rentals from retail sales outlets, adding that the full activation of the project would enhance its viability. He said that there had been increase in the number of buses from 35 to 100 and the routes from three to four due to the support of the administration, adding that the increase in the buses enabled more riders to commute and helped to achieve the 1.6 million passenger traffic in 250 days. He, therefore, urged governments nationwide to invest in transport interchanges just as they invest in airports.
