A member of the legal team representing the Nigeria Police in the Rivers State Judicial Commission of Inquiry on police brutality, Iyo Ubolum, has alleged that family members of some victims have threatened his life. He disclosed that during the panel’s break-time, two vehicles moved towards his direction and confronted some policemen on escort duty, saying the passengers of the vehicle insisted on seeing the officers who allegedly killed their son and brother, vowing to deal with them and their family members. His words: “I was here on Friday and immediately after the panel proceeded on break, I had to also go on break. Then, I saw two vehicles moving out from the premises to where I was seated and confronted policemen, who were on the escort team. “A man in one of the cars said, I hope you people are not from SARS. I want to see the officers that killed my brother and son. You people will not live and you will bury your children. So, the police officers were confronted rudely. The action and the conduct pose a threat.” Ubolum appealed to the panel to ensure that petitioners and other complainants appearing before it conducted themselves in an orderly manner. “I appeal to the commission, since it is geared towards fulfilling a purpose that the petitioners should conduct themselves properly.  We should all wait for the outcome of the panel’s report. They should not take the laws into their hands just because we are appearing before the commission,” he said. Chairman of the Panel, Justice Chukwunenye Uriri (rtd.), advised Ubolum to always approach any member of the panel whenever such incident reoccurred, adding: “Next time something like that happens, don’t fail to tell us. Tell any member of the commission and it may not be the Chairman alone.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
