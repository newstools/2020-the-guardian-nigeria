Owners include several other high-profile artists, including Madonna, Rihanna and Jay-Z’s wife, Beyonce. But Tidal has struggled to compete against much larger streaming services such as Spotify and Apple. The company hasn’t put out subscriber figures since 2016, when it said it had 3 million paying users, according to Bloomberg. Spotify, by contrast, had 50 million paid subscribers by March 2017. Jay-Z surprised fans in December 2019 by moving his music catalogue back to Spotify after a two-year hiatus. Apple in 2016 also reportedly explored a purchase of Tidal to bolster its music streaming offerings.
