Renewed call has been made for more investment in the agriculture sector, to boost production of food across the country. The Caretaker Committee Chairman of Ibadan South East Local Council, Oyo State, Oluwole Alawode, made the call at the empowerment programme for youths and women in the area, on poultry production. The council boss, who gave out 1,000 special breeds of birds to the beneficiaries at the council secretariat, also urged the youth in the state to key into the agriculture programme of the state government. Alawode said the agricultural empowerment programme of the council would keep the youths productively engaged and ensure food security. He said there were many advantages in the youths going into agriculture, saying they could make more money than engaging in paid jobs. “We are doing this to empower our youths and to boost food production. We have to begin to invest in agriculture, in order to be self-sufficient in food production. We chose Noiler because they are rugged breed, they have higher resistance to poultry diseases and they can be raised in confined environment and on free range. Noilers can also feed on poultry feeds and food remnant as well.
 
“Raising these birds could be done on a part time basis. The beneficiaries can do some of the jobs alongside raising the birds. The women can also do this to boost their incomes and become financially independent,” he said  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
