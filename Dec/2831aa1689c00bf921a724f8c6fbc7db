 MTN signage  “Together, they are deploying infrastructure that will accelerate connectivity and aid the consistent rollout of low-cost connectivity solutions in these areas that have non-existence or limited network coverage and broadband services,” MTN stated.  MEANWHILE, explaining how it came about the data, ITU said twice every year, its statisticians collect data on telecommunication and ICT infrastructure, access, and use for about 200 economies.
   
The data was typically sourced from regulators and national statistical offices, cover the previous three years, and formed the basis of modelled estimates for the current year.
   
Following this procedure, in 2019, ITU estimated that 54 per cent of the world’s population was using the Internet in 2019 – that was 4.1 billion people.
  
Also, ITU said in its data collection in 2020 that it received new data for 2019 and revised data for previous years. Based on this new and revised data, ITU adjusted its 2019 estimate down from 54 to 51 per cent – that is from 4.1 to 4.0 billion people using the Internet.
  
Meanwhile, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted normal patterns and trends in ICT statistics, as well as people’s behaviour in using (or not using) ICTs.
  
This, according to the United Nations arm in charge of global telecommunications, means for some of the indicators, including the number of Internet users, ITU statisticians were not able to produce estimates for 2020.  “So when we set about defining a ‘new normal’ for our post-COVID world, let us agree that this ‘new normal’ must be based on inclusive connectivity for all, and access to broadband for everyone,” ITU noted.
