In recognition of his selfless service and contributions to the development of jurisprudence in Nigeria, the Institute for Governance and Leadership Studies in Africa (IGLSA), recently convened a colloquium in honour of Justice Umaru Abdullahi.
   
With a theme, ‘The Judiciary and Governance in a Democracy’, the one-day event was organized in collaboration with the Committee of Friends on the occasion of Justice Abdullahi’s 81st birthday celebration.  Other factors that have posed as constraints against good governance in the judiciary, the speaker noted, include a weak judicial appointment system.
