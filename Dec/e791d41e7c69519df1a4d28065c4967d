And within the country, we have  over 1000  personnel currently undergoing trainings in various facilities” Sadeeq said. He said that the essence of the luncheon was to fill the vacuum created by officers not  being able to celebrate with their families, because of dedication and sacrifice to their country. He commended the President for providing NAF with the resources and appreciated the support of committees on NAF in  both the Senate and the House of Representatives.
