British companies trading in other areas would “remain stable in their rights”, he said, but EU fishing crews would lose out on guaranteed access. “So that wouldn’t be fair, that wouldn’t be honest,” Barnier said. Late on Thursday, Britain’s Prime Minister Boris Johnson and EU chief Ursula von der Leyen held a call that failed to break the logjam in trade talks. “I think I’ve always been frank with you, and open and sincere,” Barnier told the MEPs. “I cannot say what will come up during this last home straight of the negotiations. We have to be prepared for all eventualities.” Britain left the European Union on January 31 and will leave the EU single market on December 31 at midnight, with or without a follow-on accord. Without a trade deal, cross-Channel trade will be conducted on basic WTO rules and 47 years of economic integration will be disrupted by tariffs on goods.
