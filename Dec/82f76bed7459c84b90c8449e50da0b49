Notwithstanding the challenges in the global oil and gas industry, the Executive Secretary, Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB), Simbi Wabote, has stated that the agency has retained the $6.4 billion of yearly spend as a result of Local Content Act implementation.
  
The value represents 32 per cent value retention of the $20 billion yearly spend in the oil and gas industry just as Wabote said efforts are on-going to achieve 70 per cent.
  
He added that the Board has also advanced the implementation of the 10-year strategic roadmap, held the checkpoint review session for the roadmap, continued the construction of oil and gas industrial parks, secured the Final Investment Decision (FID) and award of contracts for the NLNG Train 7.
  
Wabote, while speaking at the Nigerian Content Capacity Building workshop organised for media stakeholders in Port-Harcourt and Lagos, noted that only five per cent was being retained when the Nigerian Content Act was enacted in 2010 and that the percentage grew to 26 per cent in 2017.
