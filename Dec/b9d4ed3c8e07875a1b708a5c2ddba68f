No fewer than 600 persons have benefited from another empowerment programme facilitated by the lawmaker representing Okitipupa/Irele Federal Constituency at the National Assembly, Gboluga Dele Ikengboju.
 
The entrepreneurship programme was organised in Ilutitun Town Hall, Okitipupa Local Government Area of Ondo State, at the weekend, as grants for 400 individuals to start up their small-scale businesses.
 
The empowerment came a few weeks after 200 women were empowered with N100,000 cash each by the lawmaker. It will be recalled that the lawmaker facilitated the upgrade and expansion of Ilutitun Comprehensive Health Centre, which began last week.
