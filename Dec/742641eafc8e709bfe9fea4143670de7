Dakkada Football Club have appointed Coach Umar Danlami Kwasau as their new head of their technical crew. The Kaduna-born former FC Taraba, Kada City and Delta Force coach takes over from Coach Caleb Esu, whose contract expired at the end of last season and was not renewed by the club. Speaking during a brief unveiling ceremony, which was also used to present to the public Dakkada’s new home and away kits, at the Conference Room of the Nest of Champions, Uyo yesterday, the Chairman of Dakkada Football Club, Coach Aniedi Dickson, expressed delight at being able to secure the services of the ‘experienced football tactician’ and urged him to bring his technical and tactical savvy to the fore in the discharge of his duties to the football club in the upcoming 2020/2021 Nigeria football league season. He said the move was made to fortify the technical department of the team, adding that, the new Head Coach would be given the ‘free hand’ to operate. The chairman solicited the support of relevant stakeholders from within and outside the state to enable Coach Kwasau succeed on his new assignment. In his Goodwill Message, the Senior Special Assistant (Sports) to the Governor of Akwa Ibom State, Elder Paul Bassey, who represented the Commissioner for Youth and Sports, Sir Monday Uko, as Special Guest of Honour during the ceremony, enjoined the new head coach to leverage the warmth and hospitality, which the state presents to succeed and advised him to run an all-inclusive tenure. Earlier, Coach Kwasau said he was ready to immediately hit the ground running at his new job and pledged to work assiduously with members of his new technical crew to churn out positive on-and-off-the-field results. He would be assisted by Coach Lawrence Kingsley, Coach Wisdom Etuk, Coach Sunday Etefia and Coach Otobong Ekanem.
