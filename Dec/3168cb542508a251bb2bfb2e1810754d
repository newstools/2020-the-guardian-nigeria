In commemoration of the International Day of Persons Living With Disability (PLWD), experts have called for digital inclusion and adequate welfarism for people with special needs, saying with technology, disability is invisible.
 
This was made known yesterday at the unveiling of the top 30 Most Inspiring Persons with Disability of the year, and seven finalists of the business support pitching competition, organised by Project Enable Africa and supported by Aspire Coronation Trust (ACT) foundation.
 
The goal of the business support programme is to promote entrepreneurs with disabilities’ access to training content, tools, resources and mentorship, necessary to scale their businesses, especially in the post-COVID era.
