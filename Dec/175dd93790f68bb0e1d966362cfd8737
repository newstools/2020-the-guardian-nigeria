Rolling out 5G could lead to a sharp increase in power consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, according to a report just published by France’s High Council on Climate (HCC). The report is no loony-tunes attack from the ‘5G causes COVID’ mad fringe but a data-backed input to a debate, which has long been raging in France about the mobile technology.  The HCC is an independent French body tasked with issuing advice to its government on policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. And that’s exactly what it’s done. It found that 5G technology will lead to a significant increase in the carbon footprint.
  
In France, it says, this will come mainly from manufacturing new devices for 5G along with data centre and exchange equipment. The data centres in particular will also generate extra CO2 from greater electricity generation.
   
It calculates that the carbon footprint of digital technology in France is currently around 15 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year, which represents about 2% of France’s overall carbon footprint, implying that average CO2 emissions are 11 tonnes per person – the current target for emissions of CO2 per capita in France is 2.1 tonnes by 2050. 
  
The HCC report found that 5G technology could add between 2.7 to 6.7 million tonnes of CO2 equivalents per year by 2030. 
  
Crucially this report, unlike the more ‘pro’ 5G reports and industry narratives which tend to try to work in some CO2 reduction ‘benefits’ from 5G, maintained that it couldn’t do that because there had been insufficiently robust methodologies to enable it to quantify them – things like theoretical decreases in transport demand, (5G availability being an enabler) or improvements in the energy efficiency of silicon.
