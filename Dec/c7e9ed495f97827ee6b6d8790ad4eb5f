It was a roll call of former internationals in Warri, Delta State yesterday, as the Nigeria Football Federation President, Amaju Pinnick, gave sporting facilities to Alma Mater, Hussey College. The facilities included a standard football pitch with seating capacity, a volleyball court, and a brand new block of classrooms. Pinnick said he offered the facilities as part of his 50th-anniversary celebrations, and as a way of galvanising the interest of the schoolâ€™s current-day students in sports. Aside that, Pinnick shocked the crowd when he presented the key to a brand new car to his former chemistry teacher, Mrs. Oluwaje. Pinnick also presented to the school authorities four sets of Hussey College customised football jerseys and balls, as well as four sets of volleyball jerseys and balls. Hussey College, one of the most renowned secondary institutions of learning in the country, has produced distinguished personalities in sports, banking, commerce, education, law, engineering, entertainment, the military, economics, media, and persons who went on to become monarchs. Some former Nigerian international players like Thompson Usiyen, Jossy Dombraye, Clement Temile, Mike Obiku, Morten Owolo, Ebiyon Dediare, Ogbein Fawole, Kenneth Nwamuocha, Victor Ighedosa, Humphrey Djebah, and Makpor Dibofun passed through the school. A novelty match between former Super Eagles players and former students of Hussey College ended 1-1. While former Super Eagles captain, Joseph Yobo, scored for his team, Pinnick leveled the score via a penalty kick for the Hussey College team.
