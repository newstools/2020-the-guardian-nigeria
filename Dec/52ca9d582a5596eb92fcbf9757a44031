The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has pleaded with aggrieved members not to defect, promising that the leadership was in the process of reconciling all. Chairman of its Board of Trustees (BoT), Senator Walid Jibrin, in a statement yesterday in Abuja, called for reconciliation. He said the party was doing everything possible to resolve all differences. His words: “In my capacity as chairman of PDP BoT, I am watching very keenly recent developments in our great party with a special call on all aggrieved members to remain with a view to looking for the way forward. “As a father to all, I have decided not to pay deaf ears to group or individual grievances to enable me play a neutral and fatherly role for necessary action.” The BoT chair went on:  “I wish to call on aggrieved members to sheathe their sword, while we explore all peaceful means for amicable solution. “I want to state that it is very normal for any member or group to air their views, but we must use the various reconciliation strategies to make the party the stronger. “I want to further state that PDP has come to stay with the determination to bring our detractors and enemies to shame.” He appealed to all organs of the party, including the national caucus, National Executive Committee (NEC) and the national convention to live up to expectation and be guided by justice and fairness without any sinister motive. Jibrin urged governors on the platform to sustain the main opposition party, even as he sought support for the committees headed by Governor Bala Mohammed and Senator Bukola Saraki on post-2019 election review and reconciliation of stalwarts.
