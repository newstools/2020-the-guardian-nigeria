The Non-Academic Staff Union of Educational and Associated Institutions (NASU) has decried non-payment of minimum wage arrears to its members in federal universities, inter-university centres, federal colleges of education and polytechnics. 
 
In a communique issued at the end of its National Executive Council (NEC) held in Abuja, NEC-in-Session lauded some state governments for implementing the new national minimum wage for their workers. 
 
The communique, which was jointly signed by the President of the union, Dr. Makolo Hassan, and General Secretary, Peters Adeyemi, read in part: “NEC-in-session expressed displeasure over the non-payment of the arrears of the national minimum wage to NASU members in the federal universities and Inter-University Centres, federal polytechnics and federal colleges of education by the Federal Government even when other Federal Government Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) have since been paid the arrears and called on the Federal Government to pay the arrears to the workers of the above listed institutions without further delay.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
