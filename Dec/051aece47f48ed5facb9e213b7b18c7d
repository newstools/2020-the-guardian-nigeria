The Defence Headquarters says troops of Operation Whirl Stroke, on Saturday eliminated three bandits and apprehended four others during raids on their hideouts in Benue. The Coordinator, Defence Media Operations, Maj.-Gen. John Enenche, in a statement on Sunday, said the operations took place at Tomatar Ugba and Kundi villages in Katsina-Ala Local Government Area of the state. Enenche said the troops stormed the camps following technical and human intelligence, engaged and overwhelmed the criminals with more firepower, forcing them to flee. He said the troops also pursued the fleeing criminals, neutralised three and arrested four while several others escaped with fatal gunshot injuries. According to him, troops recovered two locally-made rifles, one locally-made pistol, 16 rounds of 7.62mm special ammunition, two motorcycles, three generators and two pairs of military camouflage uniforms, and many other items. “The gallant troops are dominating the area with aggressive patrols and are equally on the trail of the fleeing bandits in order to locate and neutralize them. “Members of the general public are hereby requested to continue to provide credible information to the troops operating within their localities,’’ he said.
