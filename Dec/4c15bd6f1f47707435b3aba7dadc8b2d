• Wants ‘imposters’ investigated 
The Muaythai Federation of Nigeria has denounced a group of 30 athletes, who claimed to be representing the body in a training camp that began on December 12 and ends today in Egypt. According to reports, the 30 Nigerians, who claim to be Muaythai athletes, have been accused of visa racketeering in an attempt to gain entrance into Egypt. Yesterday, the Muaythai Federation noted that the Nigerians allegedly dubiously applied for visas by forging the body’s letterhead and seal. Speaking to journalists in Port Harcourt, Muaythai Federation of Nigeria President, Comrade Paul Egonu, confirmed the development, saying the case would be thoroughly investigated. Egonu said the federation had already written to the Egyptian embassy to notify it of the fraud, adding, however, that no name on the list for visa application is a member of the federation. He called on the Egyptian embassy to also carry out an investigation as this incident could jeopardise the good relationship between the federation and the embassy. “Muaythai in Nigeria operate under the name known as Muaythai Federation of Nigeria (MFN), and not Nigeria Muaythai Federation as claimed by these individuals. The MFN is a member of the International Federation of Muaythai Associations (IFMA), and the World Muaythai Council (WMC). “The Muaythai Federation of Nigeria has appeared as a demonstration sport in National Sports Festival under the supervision of Federal Ministry of Sports. MFN is using this medium to inform the general public to disassociate from this body.  The Federation is trying to work with the police in apprehending the individuals involved.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
