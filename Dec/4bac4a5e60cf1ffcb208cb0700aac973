The initiative, which gives both the inspired and aspiring artists the opportunity to showcase their works in the Burj Khalifa’s record-breaking LED light show if chosen, will also project winners’ works onto the Burj Khalifa iconic building. Launched on Sunday, November 22, and to be rounded off on December 31, the initiative, on a weekly basis, picks winners, which are splashed across the 109,252 square metres of the skyscraper. The Burj Khalifa Light Up Show to date holds the record for being the world’s largest light and sound show on a single structure.
