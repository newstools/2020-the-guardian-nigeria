Speaker of Taraba State House of Assembly, Joseph Kunini, has explained that he sponsored the ‘Taraba State Violence and Discrimination Against Persons’ bill for the emancipation of women and other vulnerable persons from all forms of ills in the society. The bill, which, according to him, has undergone first reading, if eventually signed into law, will minimise or even eradicate ills often inflicted on women and other vulnerable persons. Speaking yesterday at a dinner he organised for journalists in the state, Kunini said the bill “also seeks” to prohibit indecency. Reiterating his readiness to tread extra legitimate miles to ensure that the bill sees the light of day, he said the bill would cause the conviction of any person who incites, supports, or counsels another person to act violently against women. The 43-chapter bill frowns at Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) in the name of circumcision, domestic violence, all forms of abuse, forced isolation from family and friends, political violence, harmful cultural practices, incest, sexual exploitation, trafficking, indecent exposure, intimidation, among others. “Violence of whatever nature against vulnerable individuals in the society must be condemned in all its ramifications,” he said, believing that violence against the vulnerable would soon be a thing of the past in the state, if the bill sails through. Paying glowing tributes to media practitioners in the country, he urged them to always hold tenaciously to the ethics of the profession. “While carrying out your constitutional role as the watchdog or mirror of the society, you should endeavour at all times to be decorous and dispassionate, by observing the Code of Conduct for Nigerian Journalists,” he added. He charged media practitioners to shun sensationalism.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
