The Minister of State for Labour, Festus Keyamo, has assured that the Federal Government would ensure that all issues surrounding the implementation of cost-reflective tariffs in the sector are addressed soon.
   
Keyamo, who led the ad-hoc committee on electricity tariff to a facility tour of meter manufacturing Company in Nigeria, MOMAS Electricity Meters Manufacturing Company, in Mowe, Ogun State, reaffirmed the government’s commitment to the scheme.  He said: “We have been advised by the delegation on what we needed to put right in the metering code to suit both the purpose of DisCos and meet consumer’s need. “We can address the metering supply locally. We have also developed a mix grid methodology that will address sub-station system challenges.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
