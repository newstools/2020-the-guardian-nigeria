The Peoples Redemption Party (PRP), Bauchi State Chapter has suspended Yakubu Shehu Abdullahi, representing Bauchi Federal Constituency at the House of Representatives, over alleged anti-party activities, insubordination to the party’s leadership and inability to give good representation in line with its manifestos. Yakubu Shehu Abdullahi, its lone member at the House of Representatives, according to the party leaders, stands suspended for a period of 12 months. The State Publicity Secretary, Usman Muhammed, stated that at a time his colleagues were busy debating on issues of national importance, including but not limited to debate in the amendment of electoral act, he was busy romancing with the opposition party on how to win election. “These conducts are unbecoming of a member representing the PRP flag. PRP has noted with dismay that to date, almost two years into Yakubu Shehu’s representation, he has no single bill to his credit, despite the apparent challenges bedeviling his constituency, which needed legislative action. “He also has not moved a single motion on the floor to the chagrin of the party just equally, as Deputy Chairman of the committee on Emergency and Disaster Preparedness, he failed to attract relief assistance to his constituency.” The State Executive Committee (SEC) of the Peoples Redemption Party (PRP), Bauchi State Chapter also on December 23, 2020 approved the immediate dissolution of the party’s Interim Executive Committee of the Bauchi Local Government Chapter. Consequently, a Caretaker Committee has been constituted to pilot the affairs of the Chapter, pending convention. The newly constituted Bauchi Local Government Caretaker Committee has Malam Abdulmalik M. Aliyu as chairman and Salmanu Muhammad Luti as Secretary, among others. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
