Former international, Waidi Akanni, wants Super Eagles’ coaches to recall Odion Ighalo to the national team, saying the recent poor game by the team against Sierra Leone has shown the players need a leader like the Manchester United man. Ighalo retired from the national team immediately after the 2019 African Cup of Nations. But Akanni thinks the Eagles, as currently constituted, lack a leader, saying the team needs someone like Ighalo to guide them. Akanni said Ighalo should be brought back to the Eagles as captain to motivate the players, who ‘are currently low on confidence.’ He said, “It is very obvious that Nigeria needs Ighalo. We lack leadership in that team and I think Ighalo will make a perfect captain for Super Eagles to ensure that what happened against Sierra Leone in the last two matches and also in those friendly games should not happen again.” That Ighalo is currently not playing regularly at Manchester United is not a problem for Akanni, who said, “Everybody knows why Ighalo is not getting enough playing time now at Manchester United. “Of course, Edinson Cavani is an experienced and a very good player. I just hope when Ighalo is given another opportunity, he will make good use of it. “Also, everybody knows that his loan deal will end in January, and obviously he will either return to his parent club or look for a better club. I think he has satisfied himself playing for his childhood club, which is a big plus for him. So, I won’t fault Manchester United’s coach or Ighalo for his lack of playing time. But I think Nigeria needs him because of the situation we are in right now,” he stated. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
