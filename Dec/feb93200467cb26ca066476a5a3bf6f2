A 40-year-old jealous lover, Etifa Obukulubu, who set ablaze his estranged girlfriend and a pastor ablaze at the Igbogene area of Bayelsa State in October, narrated to newsmen yesterday that he caught both of them on a bed having a romp.
 
Obukulubu, who was among 45 suspects of various crimes paraded by the Bayelsa State Police Command, said he acted in anger after peeping through the window to see the pastor on top of his girlfriend.
 
The Guardian had first reported how the pastor, working with the New Baptist Church and a female assistant were burnt to death when Obukulubu set the home of the pastor on fire over suspicion of infidelity.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
