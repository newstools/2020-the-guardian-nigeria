The Federal Government has designed a module to train over 2,000 youths for a period of one month on fabrication of agriculture tools and machines for effective all year round farming system in Nigeria. The youths, drawn across the six geo political zones will be trained in batches at the National Centre for Agricultural Mechanisation (NCAM), Ilorin, Kwara State. Already, the first batch of 50 people, have kick started their training at the centre. According to the Executive Director of the centre, Dr. Yomi Kasali while addressing the participants, the national training of the youths on agro processing machines and equipment, would serve dual purposes of increasing the Gross Domestic Products (GDP) and create massive employment opportunities. Kasali said: “The Federal Government has given us the opportunity to train the youths on how to fabricate agro processing tools for envisaged agric turning points in the country. The focal point of the training is tactical because the youths hold the future of any nation. “It is a long term policy that will serve as a revolution to Nigerian economic policies as well, because more jobs will be created for the youths and this will in turn boost the economy.” For him, NCAM with its seasoned instructors could successfully engage in massive fabrication and manufacturing of light and heavy weight equipment to replace the obnoxious agricultural traditional tools, urging state governors to make use of the available opportunities.
