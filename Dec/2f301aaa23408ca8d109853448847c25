The Nigerian Afro-pop artiste, Dillz, has presented his debut project in style, tapping on industry veterans— Peruzzi and Oxlade — in catchy playboy anthems. The project, titled, Euphoria, is colourful, intimate and pulsating. The EP presents a rousing seven-track journey into love and its excesses. In Euphoria, Dillz is unafraid to tap into his vulnerability to make relatable love songs. With such warmth and honesty, his music takes the listener on an emotional journey with highs and lows in equal measure. The EP follows the release of singles, Fairytale and Ayo, which were met with acclaim and garnered over a hundred plays on streaming platforms. And as Dillz slides in, and out of falsetto, crooning heartfelt lyrics, it is apparent that this dreamy sensation is here to stay. There is lamba, there is music, there is dance… what’s not to love?
Dillz’s Euphoria is currently available on all streaming platforms.
