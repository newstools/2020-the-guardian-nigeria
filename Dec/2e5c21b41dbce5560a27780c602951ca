In the last edition of this editorial, we addressed the discontent of the prevailing state structure in the country in vivid details. We argued that the federal essentiality of the state structure has been atomised in ways that it is best qualified as unitary, where all authorities flow from the central government – the worst consequence of unitary system foisted since 1966. Without a doubt, as we have been saying, this situation has been counterproductive to the autonomy of the component nationalities of our country. Therefore, we have argued that renegotiating the present non-descript structure and restoring its federal muscles is feasible. In this connection, we have a natural follow up in today’s comment: We present some of the merits of the 1963 Republican Constitution of Nigeria that was truly federal and seemed to have worked for the country until the military truncated the process – 56 years ago.
