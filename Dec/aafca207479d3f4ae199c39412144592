Gender rights advocacy groups, including Women Empowerment and Legal Aid (WELA) Initiative, Women Trust Fund (WTF), Centre for Democracy and Development (CDD), West Africa, Women Advocates Research and Documentary Centre (WARDC), Vision Spring Initiative (VSI) and Women in Politics in Nigeria (WPIN), have filed a joint lawsuit against President Muhammadu Buhari and Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, for alleged marginalisation of females in governance and decision-making processes in Nigeria. In the case numbered FA6/ABJ/006/2020 and filed before Justice Okon Abang of the Federal High Court, Maitama, Abuja yesterday, the plaintiff is seeking for statutory and constitutional rights of the female gender in Nigeria, which it claimed, had been violated over the years by subsequent administrations, but worsened under the present administration. The matter could not be decided due to absence of the first and second respondents despite being served notice of proceedings twice. The presiding judge, who acknowledged importance of the matter, adjourned the case to February 5, 2021, ordering a fresh service on the defendants. Marshall Abubakar held brief for counsel to the applicant, Femi Falana (SAN). To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
