Similarly, the overall market capitalisation value also declined by N232 billion to close at N18.072 trillion. The down trend was also driven by price depreciation in medium and large capitalised stocks amongst which are; Lafarge Africa, Guinness Nigeria, Zenith Bank, Dangote Sugar Refinery, and MTN Nigeria Communications (MTNN). Analysts at United Capital Plc said that “The weakening investor sentiment remains largely in line with our expectations as our technical charts continue to view the market as overbought. “That said, we think investors will continue to maintain a cautious approach to investing in the absence of any major positive catalyst. As a result, we anticipate further bearish proceedings for the rest of the week.” Market sentiment, as measured by its breadth, was strongly negative, as 40 stocks declined, relative to six gainers.
