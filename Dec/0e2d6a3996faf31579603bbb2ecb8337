They were released pending their trial. A video aired on social media shows four men beating two asylum-seekers in the camp on the Aegean island as they were returned from a super market on Friday. The policemen keep beating them even after handcuffing. On Friday night, the police announced an investigation on the matter. Police sources said the four men claimed they hit the asylum-seekers because they were attacking passing cars and drunk. The asylum-seekers have returned to Kara Tepe camp which houses 7,300 migrants, including vulnerable groups, in harsh conditions. On Saturday, the tents flooded during heavy rainfall.
