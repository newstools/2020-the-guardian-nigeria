A distraught Mr Demian Oyendikwe, aged 59, yesterday appeared before the Edo State Judicial Panel of Inquiry for victims of SARS and related abuses for financial compensation over the loss of his goods worth N38 million.
 
He told the panel that his goods, stocked in a warehouse at Eribo Estate, Textile Mill Road, Benin, was completely looted by hoodlums who hijacked the #EndSARS protest.
 
Oyendikwe said since the incident, his creditors had been on his neck, asking for their money and that he had no means of paying back. He, therefore, decided to approach the panel for financial assistance.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
