Telecommunications subscribers are yet to agree with the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Pantami, who claimed that there has been 50 per cent drop in data prices. Subscribers, who spoke with The Guardian, said it was not yet uhuru as far as drop prices are concerning. While some agreed with the minister, others claimed it was yet to reflect in the quality of the service. President, National Association of Telecoms Subscribers of Nigeria (NATCOMS), Chief Deolu Ogunbanjo, said the telecommunications operators must be monitored closely. Ogunbanjo, who spoke with The Guardian, yesterday, said the drop in data price was a technical’ deduction based on promotional activities by the operators. Another subscriber, Gbenga Olowo, also stressed the importance of customers getting value for their money. Olowo said the speed was still an issue, urging the Federal Government to look into the matter as fast as possible. To Ufuoma Okezie, her challenge is the sudden depletion of data. “I think the telecoms operators know what they are doing. They will give you at a cheaper price, but before you know it, 1.5G that should last for a month will disappear by the end of two weeks. So, I think this is an area the government should look into urgently. It is not only about data price reduction.” Speaking with The Guardian in the week, the EVC of NCC said while there has been 50 per cent drop in data prices, and there is a target of N390/1G by 2025, the issue of data deletion is still a huge concern. Pantami had said that the reduction in data price was in line with the directive he gave to the NCC to put measures in place to reduce the average cost of data in the country. He stated that the new Internet data price was a resolution from a government committee inaugurated on December 16, 2020, to develop the Nigerian National Broadband Plan (2020-2025).
