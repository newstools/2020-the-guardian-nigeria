The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has declared Peoples Democratic Party’s (PDP) candidate, Dr. Stephen Odey, winner in Saturday’s Cross River North Senatorial District bye-election following the death of former representative of the Senatorial District, Rose Oko. Collation Officer for the bye-election, Prof. Ameh Akoh of the Alex Ekwueme Federal University of Technology, Ikwo, Ebonyi State, announced the results yesterday, saying Odey scored 129,207 votes to defeat eight other candidates. He disclosed that his closest rival, Joe Agi (SAN) of the All Progressives Congress (APC) scored 19,165 votes, adding: “The PDP candidate, having scored the highest number of votes cast, is hereby declared winner in line with electoral guidelines.” He said nine political parties contested the senatorial by-election and six for the State Assembly. Agent of the PDP, Thomas Aruku said: “I see the victory as well deserved because among all the political parties in the election, the PDP that traversed all the 54 electoral wards. So, to me, we are just reaping the fruits of our labour.” Meanwhile, the PDP is said to have entered the race with two candidates as a result of different Federal High Courts declarations. The Federal High Court in Calabar declared Odey as the candidate, which was upheld by INEC, while another Federal High Court in Abuja declared Jarigbe as the candidate. However, The Guardian observed that the two PDP candidates campaigned and worked for with different agents during the electioneering campaigns.
