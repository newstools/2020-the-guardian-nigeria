As Nigeria joined the rest of the world to mark Human Rights Day, which is usually the last day of the 16 days of Activism against Sexual and Gender-Based Violence (SGBV), Project Director, Vision Spring Initiatives, Ngozi Nwosu-Juba, said the day should remind Nigerians to respect the rights of everyone, young or old. The day is observed yearly on December 10.
 
Speaking at a conference to mark the day in Lagos, she said more Nigerians were experiencing an erosion of their rights and recent events in the country should be a cause for concern.
 
With the theme, ‘Recover Better – Stand Up for Human Rights,’ she said Nigerian youths must begin to defend their collective human rights as their future depends on it.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
