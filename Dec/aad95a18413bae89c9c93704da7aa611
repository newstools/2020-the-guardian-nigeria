Entrepreneurial reality TV show, ‘The Next Titan’, has had a rollercoaster of emotions from the viewers and contestants as five more contestants get evicted. These entrepreneurs are Stella Okenwa, Oluwadara Olaifa, Mordi Onyeka, Henry Tezuegwe, and Kelvin Steve. Though bringing their “A” game on the show and being remarkably impressive, they got knocked out due to stronger contenders. At each of the board room sessions, the presentation to the judges and crossfire between both groups was intense. But, after the judges reviewed their given tasks thoroughly, the victor team got the spoils while the losing team nominated their teammates for possible eviction. For these evicted contestants, the dream to win the N10million cash prize has been differed.  
 
Nevertheless, they expressed utmost gratitude to The Next Titan for giving them the opportunity to have participated in the show as well as the knowledge acquired from the academy and its business leaders which would be applicable to their lives and businesses.  Henry is the founder of Hybrid Electric Power Solution Unit (HEPSU), a battery-powered electric generator of the present day innovation that generates electricity without the use of fossil fuel and without having to use external sources of power (sun intensity, water volume, wind velocity, biomass). 
 
While Kelvin on the other hand is the founder of Eco-Energy Africa, a technology-based company that focuses on converting agricultural and domestic waste into biofuels such as charcoal briquettes.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
