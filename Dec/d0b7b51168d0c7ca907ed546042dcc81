Participants at the Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) Finance Series Webinar, organised by the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), in Lagos, weekend, have underscored the need to adopt strategies that would enable operators develop their business models and attract private equity investment.
   
The stakeholders, who bemoaned the comatose state of the Nigerian SMEs sector, especially with the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, submitted that if nothing was done urgently to revitalise this market segment, the rate of unemployment would worsen in the next few years.	 
 
Speaking on the theme: ‘Private Equity: A Bridge or Albatross? Role of the Capital Market,” they maintained that given the sector’s contribution to the gross domestic product (GDP), there is a need to attract huge investment into the sector and maximize Nigeria’s economic growth.  “FMDQ private market in the near future will develop solutions that would support startups from growth phases and attract capital that would enable them to list in larger exchanges.”  “SMEs contribute significantly to the nation’s GDP and are critical to stimulating economic growth. They form the catalysts required for the economy to navigate the pandemic. With these, it becomes critical that this group is assisted to meet whatever challenge confronting them presently,” he said.
 
Managing Director of NASD Plc, Bola Ajomale, urged SMEs to ensure that they disclose information about their company with proper documentation to make it easy for investors to buy into these firms.
 
He said a well-structured and outlined business strategy would make financing or funding easy for investors, and advised them to determine what kind of investors or shareholders they need for their business model at the start.
