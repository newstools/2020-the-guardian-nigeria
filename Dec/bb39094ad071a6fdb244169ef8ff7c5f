Twenty-four players, made up of 16 men and eight women, are in the final rounds of the on-going 52nd Asoju Oba Molade Okoya Thomas Table Tennis Cup, which ends today at the Teslim Baloguin Stadium, Lagos. Fans from within Surulere area of Lagos State have been coming out in their hundreds to watch the action-packed tournament organised in line with COVID-19 protocols. Today, the defending champions, Bose Odusanya and David Fayele, will be tested in their quest to retain the titles. Forty-eight men and 25 women registered for the two-day tournament under the technical guidance of the Lagos State Table Tennis Association (LSSTA). According to tournament referee, Ranti Lajide, the excitement shown by the players and the turnout of fans show their interest in the tournament. “I am so surprised that fans are still eager to watch table tennis matches despite the COVID-19 protocols. Also, I must commend the family of late Chief Molade Okoya-Thomas for deciding to stage this edition despite the pandemic. The players are happy that they are competing again and I hope we can have new players emerging from the edition. “With the players’ enthusiasm and the standard of play, I am sure we can have a new face coming out from the tournament, which has continued to groom world stars in the status of Olajide Omotayo, who now plays for the senior national team,” Lajide said.
