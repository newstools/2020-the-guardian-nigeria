 Promoters are working on two-fight battles that will decide the undisputed world heavyweight boxing champion between Anthony Joshua and Tyson Fury<br />  Joshua’s win over Kubrat Pulev on Saturday night cleared the way for the super-fights to happen and talks will centre on a two-fight package. Fury’s promoter Frank Warren says the only thing that could prevent an all-British heavyweight showdown are “egos”. Joshua, 31, retained his WBA, IBF, WBO, and IBO belts with his ninth-round knockout of Pulev at Wembley Arena.
Fury, 32, has held the WBC, The Ring magazine and lineal titles since defeating Deontay Wilder in February 2020. “If it does happen, it will be a two-fight package and could generate between £300-500 million, depending where and when it takes place,” said Warren. “All the parties have to park their egos up.” Joshua’s promoter Eddie Hearn is confident that talks could take just “a couple of days” to complete a deal between the boxers.
 Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Warren said: “I’m quite sure it will happen. “The fighters want it to happen, and it’s our job – being the promoters and managers – to make sure it does happen.” Only 1000 fans were able to watch Joshua’s win at Wembley due to COVID restrictions and any potential fight with Fury might have to take place abroad if significant numbers of spectators are not allowed. “I’d love it to be in the UK, but at the moment there’s no chance of that happening, until probably next June because of the COVID restrictions,” added Warren. “Other than that, it’d be taking it abroad somewhere, where they’d put up a huge site fee.” Joshua fought Andy Ruiz Jr in Saudi Arabia last year and the gulf state is a potential venue for the fight with Fury.
