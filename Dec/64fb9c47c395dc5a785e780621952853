Analysts argued that prevailing negative sentiment on NSE for two days is an indication that funds left the market due to continued profit-taking. They urged the government to initiate policies capable of providing more liquidity and a stable exchange rate to stimulate the market positively. InvestData Consulting Limited said: “The prevailing negative sentiment on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) for two days, so far, is to be expected, even as market fundamentals remain strong. “There is a sign that the market is waiting for another trigger in the form of information or statements such as a policy adjustment by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) capable of providing more liquidity and stable exchange rate to further impact the market positively. “We expect a mixed trend to continue amid slight improvement in Treasury bills rates, profit-taking, portfolio rebalancing and repositioning in the new month, just as the market awaits inflow of funds from alternative investment and adjustment in CBN policies.” Analysts at Codros capital said: “In the coming week, we expect the minimal activity in the T-bills secondary market to persist as participants await the issuance of the CBN’s special bills.” Last week, profit-taking by investors halted six days of a bullish run to commence a downturn on Monday, causing market capitalisation to depreciate by N27 billion.
