The Nigeria Squash Federation (NSF) has disclosed that the Youth and Sports Ministry has endorsed squash as a medal- winning event at the forthcoming National Sports Festival scheduled for Benin City next year. The Squash Federation President, Boye Oyerinde, said the body is delighted that the sport has been accorded due recognition in the festival, noting that since assuming office as the boss of the body, the federation has organised various international championships to keep players in top form and at par with their counterparts overseas. He, however, said the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown affected some programmes lined up for the 202O season. Oyerinde revealed that the federation is currently working out modalities with some schools across the nation to train children on the rudiments of the sport, adding that creating awareness on the sport at the grassroots would help discover young talents in schools. He urged more corporate bodies to sponsor championships, stressing that the game has potentials to put Nigeria at the world map “This is one of the achievements of my board. Squash has suffered set back this year due to COVID-19 pandemic. Last year was exciting for players because they were able to participate in international recognised tournaments in the country and get rated in the Professional Squash Association (PSA) without travelling outside the country. “The challenge we are facing is in getting more sponsors to invest in the game of squash. Nigeria has abundant talents waiting to be exposed and developed. The federation is working hard to organise more tournaments next year and also get funds to give domestic players international exposure. “The NSF must also thank ex professional players for helping in repositioning the game in Nigeria,” he said.
