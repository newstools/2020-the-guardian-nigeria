Residents of Aerodrome GRA in Ibadan, Oyo State capital, have protested against the siting of a gas plant in the estate due to incidence of gas explosions in the country.
 
The residents, under the umbrella of Aerodrome GRA Homeowners and Residents (AGRA), also appealed to Oyo State Government and the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) to revoke and stop the construction of LPG gas plant in the area.
 
AGRA Vice President, Prof. Omolola Atalabi, maintained that proper Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), which is part of the conditions for the establishment of a gas plant, was not carried out before the purported approval was granted.
