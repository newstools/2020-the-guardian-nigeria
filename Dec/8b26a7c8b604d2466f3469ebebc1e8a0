BUA to spend S1b on new cement plants
Local cement production capacity may hit 60 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) by 2022 as BUA plans to establish three million metric tonnes cement plants in the country.
   
BUA Cement has signed an agreement with Sinoma CBMI of China for the construction of three new cement plants of three million tonnes each yearly in Edo, Sokoto and Adamawa states. The projects are to be completed by the end of 2022. Upon completion, this will bring BUA Cement’s total capacity to 20 million metric tonnes.
   
The new projects will add 9 million metric tonnes to the existing capacity. The three new plants are in addition to BUA Cement’s already existing 6mmtpa plants in Edo, 2mmtpa plants in Sokoto and another 3mmtpa plant in Sokoto to be commissioned in Q2 2021.  In his comments, Chairman of SINOMA CBMI, Tong Laigou, commended the longstanding partnership between BUA and CBMI, expressing pleasure to work with BUA on the project.
