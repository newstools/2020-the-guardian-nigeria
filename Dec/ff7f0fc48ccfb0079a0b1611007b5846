An Ikeja Magistratesâ€™ Court on Friday remanded a 21-year-old motorcyclist, Chukwudi Udoh, in Kirikiri Correctional Centre for allegedly being in possession of firearms. Udoh, a resident of No. 4 Adekoroye Street, Ejigbo, Lagos, is facing a four-count charge of unlawful assembly, conspiracy, attempted robbery and possession of firearms. The Magistrate, Mr A.O.O. Fajana, who did not take the plea of the defendant, ordered the prosecution to send the case file to the Lagos State Department of Public Prosecution (DPP) for legal advice. Fajana adjourned the case until Jan. 26, for hearing. Earlier, the prosecutor, Sgt. Kenrich Nomayo, told the court that the defendant committed the offences with others, still at large, on Sept. 19, at 3.00 p.m at My Villa Hotel, Ejigbo, Lagos. Nomayo alleged that the defendant was arrested while in possession of one locally-made Beretta pistol, loaded with five rounds of 9mm ammunition, for the purpose of an unlawful act. The prosecutor said that the defendant claimed that he received the gun from one Chidimma, now at large. He said that the defendant also belonged to an unlawful society known as Aro Barggar Confraternity. The offences contravened Sections 41, 328(1), 299 and 406 of the Criminal Laws of Lagos State, 2015.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
