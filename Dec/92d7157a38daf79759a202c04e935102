Christmas came early for inmates in the correctional facility at Kirikiri, Lagos State, as they received various gift items from the General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), Pastor E.A. Adeboye, as part of his yearly outreach to inmates.
 
A delegation from the church visited the centre on Sunday to donate food items, toiletries, medicine, musical instruments and copies of the Bible, among other items.
 
Emphasising the need for the inmates to rededicate themselves to God and embrace a new life, the church said such a visit was part of its Christian Social Responsibility (CSR) and in line with the instruction Christ gave to the church.
