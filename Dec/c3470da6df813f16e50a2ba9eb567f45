Olumide Oyejide was crowned the over all winner of the late Mrs. Janet Adowei Scrabble Championship, which ended at the weekend at the COWLSO Hall, Fashola Hotel, Ajah, Lekki, Lagos. Wale Fashina came second, while Alaugbaida Babajide took the third position. The 10-game match series organised by the president of Lekki Scrabble Club, Adowei Ebikeme, in memory of his late mother, who died November this year, featured 46 top players drawn from across the country. Speaking at the event, Ebikeme said the meet was another platform to bring players together to sharpen their skills after the COVID-19 pandemic enforced sports lockdown. He noted that the meet lived up to expectations as all the top stars worked hard to win every point, adding, “it is a normal routine for scrabble players to organise tournaments of this nature when they are celebrating any occasion. This particular event is special because many players have not competed physically in scrabble because of the COVID-19 since March. Most of the tournaments held this year were virtual.” He disclosed that the top 20 players shared N300, 000 cash prize courtesy of support from friends of scrabble, adding, “I will organise the championship in memory of my late mother every year.” Also speaking on the event, convener of Friends of Scrabble, Segun Durojaye, said the convergence of Nigeria’s top players at the late Mrs. Adowei Scrabble Meet gave the stars the opportunity to revive the competitive spirit in them after the COVID-19 lockdown. “We have to come out as one big family to support our own in the Scrabble meet. It was exciting as every player in Nigeria attended the event in good sprit. “Scrabble has been dry this year due to COVID-19, but everything will be better next year as many competitions have been lined up in 2021,” he said.
