The Institute of Agricultural Research and Training (IAR&T) has urged youths to embrace modern farming techniques, as the era of cutlasses and hoes has passed.
 
Executive Director of the institute, Professor Veronica Obatolu, disclosed this during a training organised by the Senate and House of Representatives joint committee on Agriculture for selected youths in Ibadan, Oyo State, noting that farmers across the country should embrace modern farming techniques in order to compete with their contemporaries across the globe. 
 
While noting that the era of using simple implements to farm has gone, she added that youths who are interested in farming would need to embrace modern facilities if they are to succeed in agriculture. Represented by the Deputy Director of the institute, Dr. Olaide Saka, Obatolu said: “We need to encourage our youths to embrace agriculture. And we need to inform them to embrace modern farming techniques. I want you to take this training serious. It is not a child play.
 
“This time around, we are embarking on training of youths, men and women on the use of modern farming techniques.” 
 
In his welcome remarks, the Bursar of the Institute, Mr. Michael Fadipe described the training as capacity building initiative. “We must first expose them to the theoretical aspect on what these equipment can do. And after that we go to the field to explain how these equipment can be used.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
