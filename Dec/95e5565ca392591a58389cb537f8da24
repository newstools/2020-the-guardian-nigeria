Four persons were confirmed dead while 10 others sustained various degrees of injuries in a motor accident involving an 18-seater commercial bus and an articulated vehicle on the Benin-Ekpoma-Abuja expressway.
 
The crash occurred about 11:30a.m. yesterday near Obagie community in Uhunmwonde Local Government Area of Edo State.
 
The 18-seater bus, it was gathered, was heading towards Ekpoma and was trying to avoid a pothole when it suddenly had a head-on collision with an articulated truck laden with baskets of tomatoes.
 
A passenger who was travelling in a Sienna bus directly behind the ill-fated bus disclosed that their own vehicle narrowly escaped running into the wreckage. The eyewitness explained that following the crash, the bus fell on the driver’s side along the road.  Always believe that the other driver is a ‘mad’ person and by so doing, you will be conscious,” he warned. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
