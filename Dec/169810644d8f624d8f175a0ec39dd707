The founder of the Synagogue Church of All Nations (SCOAN), Prophet Temitope Balogun Joshua, has become the first religious leader in Africa to surpass 5 million followers on the popular social media platform, Facebook.
 
Joshua, who surpassed the milestone on the evening of Monday, December 14, thanked his followers in a Facebook post commemorating the feat. “Thank you for joining us in our mission of changing lives, changing nations and changing the world through the glorious Gospel of Jesus Christ,” he wrote, adding that the best is yet to come.
 
The cleric, who founded the popular Christian channel, Emmanuel TV, beat Pastor Enoch Adeboye, another popular Nigerian pastor, to the milestone by a slim margin.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
