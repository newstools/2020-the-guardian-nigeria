• Event set to debut at Paris 2024 Games
The Nigeria Olympics Committee (NOC) believes the country has the talent to qualify for and excel at the breakdancing event when it debuts at the Paris 2024 Olympic Games. It added, however, that the success would depend on the seriousness stakeholders attach to formation of a federation and training of dancers in the rules governing the sport as an Olympics event. NOC Media, Phemmy Adetula, told The Guardian yesterday that the committee would aid stakeholders to develop the talents of youths with passion for dancing, adding that the focus now would be on getting the country ready for the 2024 Games in France. “Break dancing has been approved by the IOC to be official an sport at the 2024 Paris Olympics. Any organisation interested in forming a federation for break dancing should apply with the NOC to get the guidelines and approval they need to operate in the country. “When the federation is eventually allowed to operate officially after meeting the international accepted requirements, they can participate in the Olympics qualifiers to earn Nigeria a ticket to the 2024 Games,” he said.
 
The IOC announced on Monday that Breaking, the official name for competitive breakdancing, would become an Olympic sport for the first time at the 2024 Paris Olympics. It was one of four events approved for the summer games. The others are surfing, skateboarding and sport climbing, but all three events will also be part of the Tokyo Olympics in 2021. Breaking debuted in 2018 at the Summer Youth Games held in Argentina. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
