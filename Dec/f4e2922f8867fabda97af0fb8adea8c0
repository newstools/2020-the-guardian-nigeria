President and Chairman of Council, Gladys Simplice The Chartered Institute of Taxation of Nigeria (CITN) has equipped inductees admitted through the direct membership route on pre-orientation programme to become better tax professionals. President and Chairman of Council, CITN, Gladys Simplice, who said this at the opening of the three-day programme, said her expectation at the end of programme is for the country to have more tax professionals offering professional services to government, individuals and corporate entities towards building an efficient tax system. She said it was important for the inductees to participate in the programme to be eligible for the proper induction ceremony. Adjunct Associate Professor, CITN Tax Academy (CTA), Kareem Adedokun said during the training, facilitators would address topics centred on the challenges of the Nigerian tax system, digital tax economy, industry-specific tax issues and taxation across Nigerian borders and its implication among others. Noting that the place of taxation in national development has been brought to the front burner, he said at the federal and state levels, there have been increased activities towards internally generated revenue with different strategies being employed. He said the academy on its part recognises the need for a continuous provision of a strong manpower base for the Nigerian tax system, and shall contribute its fair quota. He added that the event has been adequately equipped to provide technical tax information, expert knowledge between members and tax practitioners with experience in tax education, practice and administration.
