 George Daika  On the side of PDP, the main gladiators, who will defend the senatorial seat in the zone are Senator Jeremiah Useni, Hon. Beni Lar, Chairman of Langtang North Local Government Area chairman, Dr. Laven Ubandona, the two members representing Langtang North in the Plateau State House of Assembly and former chairman of Shendam Kemi Nshe.  In a chat with journalists, Daduut said that her gender has additional value to her aspirations, because women have not been in open politics as the men. She said that women have been celebrating the men in politics and helping them to achieve their aspirations.
  
She said if she is elected, she will sponsor people–oriented bills at the Red Chamber of the National Assembly, especially bills on curbing violence against the girl–child and women generally, while the youth will be empowered in order that their welfare and livelihood will improve.
  
On the insinuation making the rounds that she is a stooge of the governor, so that he will have a soft–landing in the Senate after his eight-year tenure as governor, Prof. Daduut said that as an academic; “It could have been anybody. Even if the governor did, I have the choice to say no or yes. But because of the aspiration, I will stand my ground.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
