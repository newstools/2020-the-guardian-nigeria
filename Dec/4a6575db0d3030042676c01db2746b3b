The absence of Magistrate A.A. Ajibade of an Osogbo Magistrates’ Court in Osun State has stalled the trial of a civil servant in the state, Mr Gbenga Samson Ayenioye, and his friend, a Nollywood actor, Mr Tunde AmokeOja, over alleged rape of a teenager (name withheld).
 
The matter had been adjourned till December 30 for hearing, but when our correspondent got to the court, it was learnt that Magistrate Ajibade did not come to court.
 
It was further gathered that the magistrate was on leave. The matter had been adjourned more than twice without any headway.
 
When the accused persons were arraigned by the police on October 7, the matter was presided over by Magistrate Opeyemi Badmus, who ordered the remand of the duo and adjourned it till November 19 for hearing.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
