Beyond the good talents that we have put together, we also need capable hands to manage them. These are the people that have set their eyes on a greater glory on the podium performance and I am sure many other Nigerians will join the basketball revolution.” Dare reiterated his commitment to grassroots sports development, saying, “We hope to have effective grassroots penetration of basketball youngsters to start a project that would have a basketball court in at least one senatorial district in the country. “This is a commitment that is being shared by the NBBF and the Federal Ministry of Sports.” Earlier, Kida told the minister that Nigeria’s ascendance in basketball was made possible by good planning, the commitment of the players, and the engagement of one of the best coaches in the NBA.
