 Charley Pride  Pride’s family confirmed his death in a statement, saying he had passed away in Dallas, Texas. Born in racially segregated Mississippi in 1934, Pride was known for 1970s hits including “Kiss an Angel Good Mornin'” and was the first African American to be inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame.

Tributes poured in from country music luminaries in the wake of the news, with Dolly Parton saying she was “heartbroken”. “Charley, we will always love you,” she wrote in a tweet. Singer Billy Ray Cyrus hailed Pride’s role as a “true trailblazer.” “He took down walls and barriers meant to divide,” he said. “He became a bridge of music for music lovers who found they had way more in common than they had different.” Former US president George W. Bush also paid tribute, in a statement praising Pride as a “fine gentleman with a great voice.” Pride’s death from Covid-19 came a month after he accepted an award at the 54th annual Country Music Association Awards in Nashville.
