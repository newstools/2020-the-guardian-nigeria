Two weeks after a tricycle operator was killed by a police officer in Rivers State, a 38-year-old man, Mr Jimoh Abiodun, was again killed by a policeman after a brief altercation over an iPhone at the weekend.
 
It was gathered that following an argument over the purchase of an iPhone with the father of three, a yet-to-be identified officer got infuriated and shot dead Abiodun around Elelenwo community in Obio/Akpor Local Government Area of the state. The victim was reportedly killed in front of a police station.
 
The Centre for Basic Rights Protection and Accountability Campaign and the police command have expressed anger over the killing. The coordinator of the rights group, Prince Wiro, called on the police to intervene in the matter.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
