 [FILES] Airlines, rising from the 76th Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the International Air Transport Association (IATA), unanimously approved a resolution re-confirming the airlines’ unwavering commitment to safely and sustainably re-connect the planet.  This lays the foundation for the harmonised implementation of a multi-layered approach to keeping travelers and crew safe. While 86 per cent of people currently travelling report that they feel safe with the new measures, there is still work to be done for universal implementation. The resolution further called on governments to work with airlines to maintain safety standards and critical skill levels during the crisis and in a safe restart and scale-up of operations in the recovery. 
 
“We must plan carefully with regulators on how to safely ramp-up operations in the eventual recovery.” Reactivating thousands of grounded aircraft, managing the qualifications and readiness of millions of licensed personnel, and dealing with a major drain of experienced workers will be key to a safe restart. From the earliest stages of the crisis, we worked with ICAO and regulators on a framework to do this. And this work continues as the crisis drags on beyond expectations,” de Juniac said.
