The dream of Nilayo Sports to reposition road races in Nigeria received a major boost, as it signed a partnership deal with Suzuki.  With the deal, the auto company will throw its weight behind the yearly Abeokuta 10 km Road Race and the Valuejet IAU African Championship in Remo, Ogun State. The partnership has an initial two-year span, with an option of three-year extension at the end of the current deal. Speaking on the occasion, the Chief Executive Officer of Nilayo Sports, Bukola Olapade said the interest of the auto company in the two major events had brought a new dimension to the organisation of the events. “This deal will add colour, value and glamour to both races, and it is a pointer to the level of acceptance the events have enjoyed globally,” he said, adding that Nilayo Sports would stick to every part of the agreement, just as he disclosed that the next edition of the two events in November and December 2021 would be bigger and better. He also said that winners in the male and female categories would get cars in addition to cash prizes. Olopade, however, stated that winners of the professional road race event would not be part of the prizes on offer. Representative of the sponsor, the General Manager of Suzuki, Aissatou Diouf said her firm’s involvement in sponsoring the events was motivated by the need to identify with different people of the world. “Suzuki is a global brand and is used by people from different backgrounds around the world. That is also the case with sports. Suzuki is ready to support sports. We will be in Abeokuta and Remo, just like we were at the Kaduna Marathon,” she said.
