The Professional Golfers Association of Nigeria (PGAN) will soon begin a special training programme that will qualify lady golfers in the country and beyond as PGA pros. Recently, the PGA of Nigeria signed a document with the R&A through the support of the Confederation of Professional Golf (CPG) to that effect. The document, titled Women in Golf Charter was aimed at promoting inclusion of women in golf. Rising from its executive committee meeting during the week, the PGA of Nigeria said it decided to toe the new line because “over the years, the percentage of ladies in golf in Nigeria and Africa has been alarmingly low despite the population statistics that put women to be more than men in Africa. “In view of the above facts, a six month intensive program to train female golfers to turn PGA pro is being put together by the PGA of Nigeria.” According to the association, “the programme, which will be very wide in coverage and deep in contents, will be in line with international best practice and guided by the CPG Professional Education Programme.” It revealed that it would hold at least two compulsory seminars for all participants. “Graduates from this programme will be expected to fill the shortfall in the PGA pros requirements in the country; grow the game among women population and provide coaching force needed to grow the game among children. “In addition, the programme will expose the trainees to career opportunities that abound in the game of golf,” the PGA of Nigeria said. The body disclosed that the training will commence in January with the final exam in July/August 2021. “At the end of the programme, only the successful candidates will be admitted into the membership of the PGA of Nigeria,” it said.
