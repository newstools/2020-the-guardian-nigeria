Operatives of the Nigerian Navy Ship BEECROFT attached to the newly established Forward Operations Base (FOB) Tarkwa Bay and Nigerian Navy Boat Service (SBS) personnel averted what could have been a black Sunday for passengers of an outboard engines boat along the Tarkwa Bay axis when their boat capsized.
 
On December 27, boats conveying 12 passengers had capsized due to a heavy wave caused by another boat transiting the same area at about 8:10 p.m. leaving their occupants scampering for help.  “Once again, boat operators and passengers are strongly advised to adhere to safety guidelines and measures before embarking on any trip. Relevant unions and associations are further advised to ensure that safety gears are provided by their members for passengers and to enforce the compulsory use of the safety gears by all passengers.
 
“Additionally, boat drivers should be subjected to regular and mandatory training and medical checks. These measure are necessary because the mishap in the first place was caused by an unprofessional boat driver with poor judgment and with no regard to the safety of others while plying the waters.
