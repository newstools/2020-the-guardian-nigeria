A former Chairman of the defunct Pension Reformed Taskforce Team, Abdulrasheed Maina, on Thursday, collapsed in court. Maina collapsed in the dock when his counsel, Anayo Adibe, was addressing the court on his no-case submission before Justice Okon Abang handling his trial. The court had to rise for five minutes to enable officials of the Correctional Service and relations of the former pension boss to attend to him. EFCC is prosecuting Maina, alongside his firm, Common Input Property and Investment Ltd, on a 12-count of operating fictitious bank accounts, corruption, and money laundering to the tune of N2 billion, for which the commission has so far called six witnesses.

The Nigeria Police Force, extradited Maina, to Nigeria from Niamey, Niger Republic, where he was  arrested after being declared wanted by the court over his trial. The former pension boss was arrested on 30th November 2020 by the team from INTERPOL Nigeria, led by the Commissioner of Police INTERPOL, CP Garba Umar.
