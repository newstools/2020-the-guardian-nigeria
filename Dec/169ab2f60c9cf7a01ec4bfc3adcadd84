Christmas is celebrated globally by Christians and non-Christians alike. With the havoc of COVID-19, no one could easily predict the colour of Christmas 2020. One of the preventive COVID-19 protocols is the avoidance of large gatherings. Christmas is a time of conviviality and mixing in multitude. With a spiraling second wave of COVID-19 in Europe and America, it was only proper to err on the side of caution by raising the red flag. To warn against our natural inclination to social gatherings in form of partying and family re-union was the right thing to do. In Britain, a spoof of Bob Geldof and Midge Ure’s song titled “Do They Know It’s Christmas?” on the famine in Ethiopia in the 1980s set the tone. The spoof, which debut on December 17, 2020, mocked Boris Johnson and his Cabinet over their handling of the coronavirus pandemic in Britain. The lines run thus: It’s Christmas time with households mixing everywhere, / and at Christmas time infections spike and we don’t care. And in our five-day window you can spread your viral load, so throw your arms around your nan at Christmas time. /But say a prayer, pray for the northern ones. /At Christmas time, it’s hard when you’ve lost all of your income. /There’s a world outside Westminster, a world of bitterness and fear./Where all the pubs are closing because they’re stuck in higher tiers./ And the Big Ben bell that tolls here are their clanging chimes of doom./Well tonight thank God it’s them instead of you./And there’ll be less aid to Africa this Christmas time./Because we’ve given all your cash to all our friends in governmental perks like the app that didn’t work. /Do they know it’s Covid time at all?  Its precise duration varied across the 4 ‘nations’ with devolved authority over health matters, ranging from a fortnight in late October/early November in Wales to 4 weeks from early November to early December in England. In all cases, the blow was softened by promises of a 5-day Christmas window when restrictions would be relaxed to allow free travel within the UK so that families could reunite with up to 3 households together. However, the prevalence rate in parts of Kent and eastern boroughs of London actually rose during England’s Lockdown 2, an early warning that all was not well. The government hence increased restrictions in London and the South East to Tier 3 in mid-December, still insisting that the 5-day Christmas window would operate. Then on Saturday 19th December, after urgent meetings between ministers and the Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies, London and the South East and parts of Eastern England were summarily put into a new, yet-tougher Tier 4 in which any household mixing is banned and travel severely restricted, while restaurants and pubs, personal services like hairdressing and nail bars, along with non-essential retail were closed again with immediate effect. Northern Ireland and Wales will start new lockdowns on Boxing Day (26th Dec). This latest U-turn by Prime Minster Boris Johnson within 24 hours has effectively cancelled Christmas within Tier 4 areas, while the 5-day window has been reduced to Christmas Day outside Tier 4 areas and in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. The gamechanger has evidently been a new variant strain of the coronavirus that is up to 70% more transmissible and spreading rapidly, although it is not more virulent as such. Hospitals in Tier 4 areas are filling up fast again, with non-essential surgery being cancelled in some for the first time since the first wave. As of 21st December, many countries are imposing short travel bans on the UK, pending urgent assessments and a unified response with the WHO. Hence Christmas will be a serious non-event for many, while over 65,000 families across the UK will mourn relatives who have already succumbed to the virus.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
