The Federal Housing Authority (FHA) has given land grabbers and illegal occupants 30 days to vacate Sharada Housing Estate, Kano. It also vowed to demolish all structures with no valid documentation erected within the facility. FHA’s Managing Director, Senator Gbenga Ashafa, gave the ultimatum on Sunday while inspecting the 32-year-old Federal Government property. Represented by the Executive Director, Business Development, Abdulmumin Jibril, the MD deplored activities of fraudsters who dupe innocent people with fake land titles, warning that the government was determined to sanitise the system. Ashafa, who also cited cases of double ownership of property in the estate, reminded occupants that his organisation was undertaking a thorough evaluation to uncover dubious claims. Acknowledging prevailing insecurity, bad roads poor drainages, he assured lawful residents of the government’s readiness to rehabilitate the estate. Chairman of Sharada Federal Housing Estate, Alhaji Abdullahi Bashir had also sought intervention over what he claimed as multiple revenue collection from the state government.
