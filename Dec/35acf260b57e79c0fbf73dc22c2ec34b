Kanye West Releases New EP “Emmanuel” On Christmas Day Kanye West made a shock return to music on Christmas Day with the surprise release of a brand new EP. The 43-year-old rap superstar unleashed a 12-minute, five-track, extended play album titled Emmanuel and presented by his Sunday Service Choir and produced by Kanye West. Kanye’s gift to fans was said to be a “celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ” as well as a collection of choral music which was described as: “ancient and Latin inspired new music.” According to press materials, Emmanuel means “God is with us” and the music featured on the EP is composed of “ancient and Latin inspired new music.” The EP was released on Christmas day in “celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ.” Kanye West’s last solo studio album Jesus Is King arrived last year following multiple delays. This year, he’s shared a few one-off singles, including “Wash Us in the Blood” with Travis Scott, “DONDA,” and “Nah Nah.” He was meant to release a new album, also called DONDA, this summer, however, the LP never materialised. This could be because he was busy with his presidential ambition throughout the year. The 12-minute EP is available on Spotify and Apple Music. Its 5 tracks are: 1. Requiem Aeternam 2. O Mira Nox 3. O Magnum Mysterium 4. Puer 5. Gloria
