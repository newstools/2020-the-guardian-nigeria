• Apprehension over second wave of protest in Delta today
• Government responsive to protesters’ demands, says Minister
The more citizens tend to move on from #EndSARS protests, the second theme that defined 2020 after COVID-19, continued incidents of police brutality jolt a grim recall of the Soro Soke movement that lasted weeks in October.
 
Yesterday, December 20, made it two months since the Lekki tollgate shooting that changed the course of the nationwide #EndSARS protest against police brutality and end to the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) outfit, reportedly infamous for terrorising, extorting money, and killing young Nigerians.
 
After nearly three weeks of sustained campaign that left the social media to the streets, October 20 saw a violent turn of events as the protests cascaded into an orgy of violence and destruction across the country.  ALREADY, there is apprehension in Ughelli metropolis of Ughelli North Local Government Area, Delta State, over a planned second wave of #EndSARS protest slated for today (Monday).
 
The protest, according to a rights activist in the state, Comrade Joe Israel, is in response to the re-arrest of the videographer, Mr Nicholas Makolomi, who shot the October viral video alleging the killing of one Joshua by a team of police operatives in Ughelli.
 
The protesters, while vowing to cripple all forms of commercial activities in Ughelli, also advised the police to exercise restraint and allow youths exercise their rights in a democracy.
 
Condemning the arrest of Nicholas, Comrade Israel said: “Personally, I would discourage any protest in the state due to the high level of insecurity. However, the government shouldn’t be negotiating with us on one hand and carrying out a vendetta on the other hand. I call on the state governor and all stakeholders to ensure the unconditional release of Nicholas.”
 
A security source yesterday hinted that policemen in the two police divisions in Ughelli have already been placed on high alert in readiness for any eventuality that might arise during the protest.  He reeled out some of the youth programmes undertaken by the Digital Skills, Employability, Entrepreneurship and Leadership (DEEL) initiative to include 75,000 youths trained this year via an online platform in partnership with IBM, another round of training in partnership with AfDB called coding for employment across 15 centres in the country, and a training in conjunction with Microsoft and Google to train young business owners on management skills, among others.
