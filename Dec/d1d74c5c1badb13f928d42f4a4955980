There were three grievous aspects of the recent mass abduction of 334 students of Government Science School, Kankara, Katsina State: The bandits fetched that number of boys with minimal resistance. They ferried the students across the state boundary without Nigeria’s security intercepting them. Thereafter, officials of the state government went into negotiation for the boys’ release.
 
Earlier in an interview with State House Correspondents, Katsina State Governor, Hon. Aminu Bello Masari, said although the bandits terrorizing the Northwest geopolitical zone started small, they have grown big in size. What the governor did not add was that the so-called bandits have grown full-fledged also in sophistication, strategy and weapons, such that they have been able to overwhelm the nation’s security agencies. 
 
Perhaps, riled by the sad narratives around the Kankara boys’ kidnap, a former Director in the Department of State Services (DSS), Mr. Mike Ejiofor, expressed dismay that government should involved itself in negotiating with criminal bandits.  Finger-pointing
BUT, prior to the recent abduction of the Kankara Science School students, the spiraling wave of criminality in Northwest was taken as a political weapon by opposing political actors to undermine their rivals. That may explain why the Federal Government could not take responsibility or exercise authority to stem the menace, apart from the failure to reappoint the former Defence Minister, Mansur Dan Ali.
 
Therefore, the finger-pointing and blame-game predated the current governor of Zamfara State, Bello Matawalle, who succeeded Governor Abdulaziz Yari of APC in a default electoral mischance in the 2019 general elections.
 
Immediate past chairman of Senate Joint Committees on Petroleum Resources, Senator Kabir Marafa, cried out in the plenary of the Senate that former governor Yari was encouraging the bandits. Marafa alleged that the bandits were bold enough to hold court in the forests and even impose levy on innocent rural dwellers and farmers because of the backing they received from the Government House.
 
While Marafa and Yari were embroiled in altercations over the politics of who got the APC governorship ticket in the state, the serious security issues raised by the Senator were dismissed as part of his bellyaches against Yari for standing against his (Marafa’s) quest to be governor.  Failure of body language
AT the outset, the present administration of President Muhammadu Buhari continued with body language, which suggests that as a former military officer, the new Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria possessed the magic wand to end insecurity in the country, particularly the insurgency in the Northeast region.
  
The recourse to armistice or accord with bandits gained currency shortly after Matawalle negotiated with the bandits, leading to the repentance of some and surrender of assault weapons.
 
However, it could be said that Kaduna State governor raised national consciousness about the carrot approach to the growing insecurity and criminality in Northwest. Governor Nasir el-Rufai astounded Nigerians, when he announced on national television that his administration went in search of leaders of herdsmen to appease them with cash for the loss of their cows, saying that killings in Southern Kaduna was a form of reprisal attacks for past losses of cattle and grazing opportunities.  
 
Despite current finger-pointing between PDP and APC over the recovery of the abducted Kankara boys, it is obvious that a mix of politics, economic and strategic missteps in the security apparatus of the country is to blame for the unrelenting banditry in Nigeria’s Northwest.
 
Matawalle might have won over some criminal lords, but the incidence of artisanal mining of gold and other precious stones in Zamfara is playing a silent role. Indians and Asians are believed to be capitalising on the situation to plunder the area with freebies and weapons to the criminals.
