There was voter apathy in yesterday’s Lagos East and Plateau Southern Senatorial Districts election The election was earlier fixed for October 31, but had to be shifted because of #EndSARS protests nationwide. In Plateau, some voters were seen going to farms, while in Lagos, electorates simply went about their normal lives in complete disregard to movement restrictions placed by the government. Lagos State Commissioner for Police, Hakeem Odumosu personally arrested over 30 vehicles that defiled the no movement order along Mile 12 Ikorodu Expressway at about 12 noon.  At the polling units in Shendam, COVID–19 protocols were observed, as voters wore facemasks, while hand sanitisers were provided. Meanwhile, Cross-river State Governor, Senator Ben Ayade has advocated an electronic voting system in Nigeria. Ayade, who said this, yesterday, after casting his vote at Kakum Town hall polling unit, Obudu Local Council, during the Cross River North Senatorial election said Nigeria must keep improving its strategy on how to make election tamper proof. “So I’m of the strong view that electronic voting is a critical option and I know the National Assembly is already doing something about it.”  On the low voter turnout, INEC National Commissioner Information and Voter Education, Mr. Festus Okoye, attributed it to failure of political parties to mobilise their supporters for the elections.
