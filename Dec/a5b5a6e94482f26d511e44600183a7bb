Minding the damages so far caused by farmers/herders unrest in Taraba State, Governor Darius Ishaku has put in place strategies to forestall recurrence. One of such plans, as disclosed yesterday by the Commissioner for Information and Reorientation, Danjuma Adamu, was to establish model ranches and livestock training centres in the state. Gassol, Bali, Wukari, Ibi, Takum, Donga, Yorro, Sardauna, Ussa, Karim-Lamido, Ardo-Kola and Zing councils had witnessed series of upheavals between herders and farmers, which led to wanton destruction of life and property. The commissioner, who stated this during an interactive session with media practitioners in the state, said the centre if established, would give the citizens of the state, particularly the youth, the opportunity to practise livestock business under a conducive environment. He added that government had secured suitable land for the smooth take-off of the ranch and training centre along Takum-Wukari road. Due to the incessant upheavals between the herders and farmers in the state the House of Assembly enacted the Open Grazing Prohibition and Ranches Establishment Law in 2017, to promote modern techniques of animal husbandry, among others.
