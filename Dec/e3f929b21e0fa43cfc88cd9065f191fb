Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has said the worsening insecurity in the country confirmed that the All Progressives Congress (APC) administration has failed Nigerians. Wike said the Progressive Governors Forum would not only acknowledge, but also accept the fact that the ruling party disappointed the country due to its abysmal performance. He said this was because, the APC-led government promised to offer better governance that would ensure safety of life and property of all Nigerians. Governor Wike made the assertion at the unveiling of Woji and Obagi roads in GRA Phase Two in Obio Akpor Council, which ceremony was performed by Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde. He lamented that virtually everything has collapsed in the country under the APC administration and that if Nigeria were truly a democratic country, nobody would be a proud member of APC. “I hear the Progressive Governors Forum saying there is insecurity. Who is responsible?  They should come out openly and say that the party in power has failed. Nigerians gave APC mandate at the Federal level and therefore, they must own up to the fact that they have failed Nigerians. “Everything has collapsed in the country. Security has collapsed.  Economy has collapsed. Nothing is working in the country.  All over Nigeria, there is insecurity everywhere,” he said. Wike maintained that until the Federal authorities apologised to Rivers State for what they did to the state, God will not forgive them, insisting that he had not disappointed Rivers people in improving their quality of living, upgrading infrastructure and securing of life and property. On his part, Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, said with evidences of Wike’s performance, it would be difficult to convince Rivers people to abandon the PDP for another party. He noted that development projects are integral part of democracy because it is used to measure the level of progress a society makes under such democratic leadership and the Wike government has committed to that task. “Right minded people like to identify with progress irrespective of their personal feelings towards the initiator. Development is a big part of democracy and every project counts towards the overall progress of the country,” he said. Rivers State Commissioner for Works, Elloka Tasie-Amadi said the Woji and Obagi road were reconstructed 12 meters wide with streetlights and built to standard.
