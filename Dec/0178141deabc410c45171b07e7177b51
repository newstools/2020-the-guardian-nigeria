·Telcos seek subscribers’ understanding over process hitches The National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) has denied claims that its website has been breached, preventing people from accessing it.
   
NIMC Head of Corporate Communications, Kayode Adegoke, in a statement posted on the Commission’s Twitter handle@nimc_ng, yesterday, said the purported breach of the National Identity Database going round the social media is “false, a hoax and of mischievous intent”.
  
However, as at the time of filing this report, checks by The Guardian showed that the site www.nimc.gov.ng had not come up.Adegoke, while assuring the public that there were no breaches or incidents, said investigations on the alleged data dump were found to be non-existent in the National Identity Database.  MEANWHILE, telecoms operators under the aegis Association of Licensed Telecommunications Operators of Nigeria (ALTON), has once again appealed to subscribers.
   
ALTON disclosed that members have responded rapidly to the Federal Government’s directive by putting in place the processes and infrastructure necessary to enable them to incorporate existing National Identity Numbers (NINs) into the current SIM registration data and support subscriber enrolment into the National Identity database.
     
In a statement yesterday signed by the Chairman and Publicity Secretary, Gbenga Adebayo and Damian Udeh respectively, ALTON said it will continue to work closely with the government to deliver on the task ahead of them and ensure that the process is as seamless as possible for all customers.
   
ALTON informed that all Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) have now received an enrolment and verification license from the NIMC or via the NCC, legally enabling them to verify NIN’s provided by customers and to enrol citizens into the NIN database.
  
The body explained that all operators have established various systems to enable subscribers with existing NINs to add their NIN’s to their SIM registration profile.  “It is important to note that we do expect that when SIM registration details are verified against the NIN database, there are likely to be inconsistencies in some of the data captured e.g. spelling, order and number of names captured. Where such inconsistencies are found, the operators will notify subscribers and provide a quick and easy mechanism to update SIM registration data and ensure alignment.
  
“To facilitate the validation, verification and enrolment processes and having now been licenced by NIMC to provide those services, operators have commenced the process of backend integration with NIMC’s database and increasing the capacity of the respective databases thus enabling more rapid validation and verification,” the statement reads.
   
The body noted that to provide operational steer representatives of NCC, NIMC, ALTON and MNOs will also be meeting regularly to review progress, identify challenges, develop solutions and generally continue to enhance the process to ensure the safety, security and well-being of our customers while making significant progress towards our collective objective.
