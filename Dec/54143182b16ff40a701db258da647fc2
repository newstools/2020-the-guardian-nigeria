Christopher Nkunku’s early goal for Leipzig was cancelled out by a superb equaliser from Jamal Musiala, 17, before Mueller tapped home to put Bayern 2-1 up. Justin Kluivert levelled before half-time and a thumping Emil Forsberg header put Leipzig ahead soon after the break. Bayern took a share of the points when Kingsley Coman produced a towering cross — his third assist of the night — for Mueller to head home the equaliser on 75 minutes.
