Cheque Fast-rising Nigerian singer Cheque has released the remix of his song “Zoom.” This time, the Penthauze rapper enlisted the help of Nigerian superstar singer Davido and Nigeria-American rapper Wale. This is Cheque’s second video from his EP Razor. The first video was off his hit, ‘Zoom.’ In July, Cheque released the EP ‘Razor’ that boasted of tracks like ‘Zoom’, ‘Loco’, ‘Satisfied’, ‘Hollywood’ and ‘Odun’. The fast-rising singer took to his social media pages to announce the release of the song featuring Davido and Wale, a Nigerian-American rapper, on Tuesday. The less than four-minute project sees Cheque crooning about his quest to succeed amid seeming hostility with Davido, and Wale adding a gloss to the lyrics. This is not the first time the 25-year-old is working with top music acts as he featured on ‘Warlords’, a track off ‘999′ EP by Olamide, alongside Rhatti, Phyno and Snow. Listen HERE
