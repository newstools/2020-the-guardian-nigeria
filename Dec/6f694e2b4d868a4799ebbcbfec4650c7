In 2020, Canon EMEA (www.Canon-CNA.com) expands its world-renowned Ambassador Programme with 59 new professionals joining the ranks. The first of its kind, the Canon EMEA Ambassador Programme was created to represent and support current and future generations of photographers and filmmakers by sharing their passion and technical know-how with fellow professionals, as well as enthusiastic amateurs who want to develop their skills.  With the largest ever intake, now featuring a total of 115 Ambassadors across EMEA, this is Canon’s most exciting and diverse programme to date. Among them are 17 incredible young photographers including Ksenia Kuleshova and Michele Spatari, alumni of the Canon Student Programme and Young Photographer Award winners.  In the most competitive selection process yet, an esteemed panel of 13 judges reviewed nominations for more than 450 photographers and evaluated over 20,000 images – covering news, documentary, wildlife, weddings, portraits, sports and more. Celebrating visual storytelling, and stories that resonate, the Canon EMEA Ambassador Programme brings together the best of the best within the imaging industry. Susie Donaldson, ITCG European Marketing Director for Canon EMEA said: “The Ambassador Programme is our opportunity to work with an amazing group of bold and inspirational individuals in the photo, video and print industry. With this refresh we are enabling and empowering photographers and filmmakers with unique perspectives from across the region, supporting them with the tools to tell those stories that matter. “We’re always evolving the Programme to seek out and welcome photographers and filmmakers from a multitude of genres and all backgrounds across age, gender and race. This year we’ve significantly increased the number of Ambassadors under the age of 30 from two to 17, which shows the remarkable range of talent within the industry and our commitment to nurturing creatives through our student programmes as their career progresses. With this latest intake we hope to pave the way for the next generation of visual storytellers, with a fresh new perspective to the Programme.” Amine Djouahra, Sales and Marketing Director at Canon Central and North Africa added “It is a privilege to be part of a programme that inspires talent and creativity in Africa. We continuously seek creative talent to cultivate the love of photograph and to showcase the rich beauty of the continent. The ambassador programme is now furthermore enriched with photographers representing diverse backgrounds and cultures, as well as a balanced mix of both genders. We have extended appointments with five female African photographers and expanded the programme with three new female ambassadors from the continent.” Joining the Programme in 2020 from Africa include: Clement Kiragu – Clement is an award-winning commercial and wildlife photographer based in Nairobi, Kenya.
