 Nigerian Stock Exchange  Analyst at Codros capital said: “We expect the profit-taking and negative reaction to the unanticipated front-end supply from the CBN to be short-lived. Yields in the fixed income market remain relatively unattractive, and we expect this to remain positive for stocks. 
 
“However, we advise investors to take positions in only fundamentally-justified stocks as the weak macro environment remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings.”
 
Analysts at Vetiva Brokerage said: “We expect the market to open the week on a muted note, with investors maintaining a risk-averse approach in the bonds and NTBs spaces. Meanwhile, we expect the improvement in oil prices to help support buy-side activity in the OMO space.”
