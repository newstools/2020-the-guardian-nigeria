 Maikaba believes Plateau United can beat Simba FC of Tanzania in the second leg preliminary round in today’s CAF Champions League encounter  Before his team’s departure, Maikaba said during the week that the yet to begin NPFL, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, affected his players’ fitness level, hence the team’s 0-1 loss at home to Simba FC in last Sunday’s first leg of the preliminary round. He noted that his players were poised to overturn the result away from home, stressing that the Jos-based side has gained enough experience from the first game to get a positive result in the second leg tie. Maikaba, who admitted that the game would be a tough one for his team, owing to the victory Simba FC got in Jos, however, assured the supporters that the team would fight like wounded lions to get the required victory in Tanzania. Maikaba urged football-loving Nigerians not to lose fate in Plateau United. “We are going to Tanzania for victory. Plateau United have learned mistakes from the first leg, having in mind that Simba FC already have confidence after beating us at home. We are going into the match in high spirit. My players did well in the first leg but the loss of concentration ruined their game. “Simba FC only has one key player, Clatous Chama, who scored the only goal for the team in the first leg. The team was built around him because I discovered all passes went to the player. So as a coach, I have worked out modalities on how my players can technically outshine Simba back home. Plateau United will surely come out victorious in Tanzania,” he said. Meanwhile, Enyimba, Kano Pillars, and Rivers United would also seek to win their games in the CAF competitions this weekend.
