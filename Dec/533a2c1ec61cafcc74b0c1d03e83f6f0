• Akinseye-George denies allegations, demands N115m legal fee A company, Nacenn Nigeria Limited, has filed a petition against Prof Yemi Akinseye-George (SAN) before the Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN) as the chairman of the Legal Practitioners Privileges Committee (LPPC) and the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), alleging professional misconduct among others.  But the firm in its petition, dated October 8 and sent separately to the CJN and the NBA, is urging them to investigate its complaints against the SAN.
   
It wants them to refer the petition to the LPPC and the Legal Practitioners Disciplinary Committee (LPDC) respectively “for appropriate sanctions as the justice of this petition demands.”
   
In affidavits on oath deposed to by Nacenn’s director, Chukwugozie Ezulike, the petitioner accused Prof Akinseye-George of violating the Rules of Professional Conduct for Legal Practitioners 2007.
   
Specifically, the firm said the SAN contravened Rule 1 and Rule 23 (1), which provide: “A Lawyer shall uphold and observe the rule of law, promote and foster the cause of justice, maintain a high standard of professional conduct, and shall not engage in any conduct which is unbecoming of a legal practitioner.
