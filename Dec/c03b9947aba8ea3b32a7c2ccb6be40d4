Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the Association of Outsourcing Professionals of Nigeria (AOPN) has said there is a need to re-invent global supply chain management processes. They submitted that there is a need for capacity building and innovation in logistics and supply chains to adapt to the new normal market demand. Managing Director, Koinonia Global Services Inc., Olufemi Boyede, said this at the virtual Fellowship Investiture/Membership Induction Ceremony by the AOPN, where he spoke on the theme ‘Redesigning Services Delivery Portfolio for the New Normal’. He urged the association to take the lead to expose outsourcing professionals to understand their utmost relevance to global business. He said since the business is largely digitally-inclined, the need for increased and up-to-date capacity building was important. In re-designing the portfolio to adapt to the current market demand, Boyede advised that research must be done properly and extensively. He said portfolios and deliverables must be flexible to meet standards. President of AOPN, Dr. Obiora Madu, said in tackling some of the sectoral challenges, the sector needs the government to create an enabling environment for businesses to thrive. He said there is the need to adopt disruptive technology, big data, effective tax regime, infrastructural development and step up advocacy for Nigeria to be an attractive outsourcing destination. He said the association would go into advocacy to grow the unexploited domestic Business Processing Outsourcing (BPO) industry to attract external opportunities. During the programme, the association conferred fellowship to some of its members while others were inducted as corporate members.
