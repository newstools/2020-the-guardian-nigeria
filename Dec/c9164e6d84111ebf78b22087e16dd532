Sylvanie-USA TODAY Sports  Nigeria-born, New Zealand-based professional mixed martial artist, Israel Adesanya, has emerged International Fighter of the Year at the 12th World MMA Awards. He brushed aside stiff challenge from top sports personalities, including his fellow countryman, Kamaru Usman, to win the award. Others nominated for the award were Aung La N Sang, Valentina Shevchenko and Zhang Weili. Adesanya, who hails from Odogbolu, Ogun State, also won the Charles “Mask” Lewis Fighter of the Year award, beating nominees like Henry Cejudo, Justin Gaethje, Douglas Lima and Jorge Masvidal. Against the unprecedented backdrop of the global COVID-19 pandemic, the awards, produced by Fighters Only, had an extended voting period of January 2019 through July 2020. This year, the fight winners skewed exclusively to the UFC. Israel Adesanya and Jorge Masvidal were multiple award winners among fighters, as was UFC analyst Joe Rogan. Conversely, Ben Askren saw two of his opponents win awards at his expense. Charles “Mask” Lewis Fighter of the Year: Israel Adesanya
