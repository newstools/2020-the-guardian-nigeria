 Chisom Chukwuneke  Chisom’s younger and only sister, Chiamaka, in her tribute, said: “She taught me that no matter how good the situation may be, this life is vanity and that everyone will die someday. She kept comforting us that even if she did not make it, she was contented she has played her role.”
 
In a sermon, Rev Azubuike Okeke had asked family and friends to take solace in the fact that Chisom died well and had fulfilled her mission on earth. Quoting profusely some portions of the Bible, he asked the family to be comforted and rejoice that Chisom’s death was not in vain.
