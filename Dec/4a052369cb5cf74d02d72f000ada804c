Ridwan ‘Scorpion’ Oyekola is in for a surprise if he thinks his World Boxing Federation (WBF) Super Featherweight fight against Lucas Matias Montesino will be a walk in the park, the Argentine has boasted. Oyekola will meet Montesino for the vacant title in Ibadan on December 27. Speaking yesterday, a story published on the official website of the sporting outfit managing the boxer, chubutdeportes.com, Montesino said Scorpion will pay a big prize for the effrontery to stand on his way to the title when they meet at the Ilaji Hotel and Sports Resort.
 
He said, “there is always extra motivation when fighting for important things. Since I found out I will be fighting for the title, I have been very motivated and doing double the work to get there better than ever. It only remains to wait for the date and time to get into the ring.” Montesino, 23, has a good record in his career so far. In 10 fights, he has seven wins (six by KO), one draw, and two losses, while Ridwan ‘Scorpion’ Oyekola has five wins (4 KOs), 1 draw, and 1 loss. He is placed number two in the African ranking. The Argentine, who is always accompanied by his father and coach, Raul Montesino, said he hasn’t been in a professional fight for a year, but claimed to be happy for the possibility that he was given to go to represent Chubut in Africa. “We had the misfortune of losing a sister in October 2019 and fighting in December for the Argentine and South American titles. It was a year that I had a bad head, I was not focused on boxing, but now it’s time to get back in the ring. I have a good feeling and really want to travel and fight more than anything,” Lucas stated. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
