Access to finance at an early stage has been identified as one of the critical challenges facing micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in Nigeria, now compounded by the impact of the COVID-19. Besides, these enterprises were already struggling long before the pandemic amid the harsh economic environment in Africa’s largest economy.
 
To this end, the opportunity for impact capital in a COVID-19 era is one of the catalysts needed to ensure Nigeria’s 41.5 million MSMEs survived the pandemic.  The event hosted fund managers, impact investors, Development Finance Institutions, and other members of the impact investing community, where about 15 entrepreneurs pitched for access to funds. They all presented innovative ideas linking various fields to technology. This year’s cohort included companies in digital health and Medtech; food, renewable energy, and Internet of Things.
   
In his remarks, the Country Director, OSIWA, Jude Ilo, said the economic impact of COVID-19 has been enormous, as small businesses are confronted with a challenging market, which restricts their ability to grow, innovate and compete.
   
Ilo noted that entrepreneurs and innovators have always fuelled economic growth, and therefore must be supported to invest their energy and ideas to deliver good jobs to boost recovery.  He said the aim of the programme was to strengthen participants’ entrepreneurial skills, to help them to become more investment-ready and able to scale up, while also exposing over 15 investment-ready enterprises to 18 impact investors and accelerating the flow of quality deals within the impact investing community. This year’s edition, according to him, featured 15 social enterprise owners who participated in a four-week investment-readiness booster delivered by Acumen, an international development organization, to prepare them for possible new ventures.
