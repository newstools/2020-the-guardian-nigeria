The Presidency, yesterday, stated that President Muhammadu Buhari would not succumb to the views of some Nigerians seeking to influence government’s decisions to suit their whims and calories. Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, who stated this in tweets on his handle, stated that what should attract national attention now was how to deal with insecurity amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Apparently addressing those he said were using languages such as ‘the nation will break up’, Shehu said President Buhari would not take decisions against the interest of Nigerians. The tweet reads: “The Presidency responds to the recurring threats to the corporate existence of the country with factions giving specific timelines for the President to do one thing or another or else, in their language, ‘the nation will break up’. “This is to warn that such unpatriotic outbursts are both unhelpful and unwarranted as this government will not succumb to threats and take any decision out of pressure at a time when the nation’s full attention is needed to deal with the security challenges facing it at a time of the COVID-19 health crisis. “Repeat: this administration will not take any decision against the interests of 200 million Nigerians, who are the President’s first responsibility under the constitution, out of fear or threats especially in this hour of health crisis. “The President as an elected leader under this constitution will continue to work with patriotic Nigerians, through and in line with the parliamentary processes to finding solutions to structural and other impediments to the growth and wellbeing of the nation and its people.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
