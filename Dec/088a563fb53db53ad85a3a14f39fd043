In an effort to positively engage the youth in the country, a group of concerned Nigerians and industry leaders have planned to initiate and implement strategies on how best to channel the minds of youths constructively. Chairman, Hensen Group, Chief Dan Ngerem; former President of Athletic Federation of Nigeria and Managing Director of Seagle Property, Osi Bobagunwa of Egbaland; Otunba Yemi Lawal and other influential personalities at a meeting with the Aare OnaKakanfo, Otunba Gani Adams, yesterday, reiterated the need to engage the youths. Ngerem, who led the team, said that Adams’ vast experience in control of crimes and national security would be needed in the task of social responsibility and crime control in the country, adding that due to what transpired after the #EndSARS protests, youths must be taken seriously and handled with care. “We are here to seek Aare’s support on how to positively engage youths in this post- #EndSARS era. As a supporter of #EndSARS and having worked with youths during his time as leader of Oodua People’s Congress (OPC), Aare Gani Adams can best advise us and help on this project,” he said. In his remarks, Adams commended the team and assured them of his support, noting that what happened in the wake of the #EndSARS protests was unfortunate as hoodlums hijacked the peaceful protests and went on to destroy property. He said the initiative of social responsibility and crime control in Nigeria was laudable, promising to support the team.
