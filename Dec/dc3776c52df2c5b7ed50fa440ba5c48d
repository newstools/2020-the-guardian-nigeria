Delta State’s N4.2 billion ultra-modern floating market built at the edge of the Atlantic Ocean in Ogheye, Warri North Local Government Area, will be completed by the end of the first quarter of next year. The State Commissioner for Works, James Augoye, made this known on Wednesday in Asaba while speaking with Journalists. He said the market will, on completion, boost both the local economy as well as that of neighboring Ondo State. Augoye explained that communities in Ondo that are close to the market will benefit economically. The riverside communities are about only 15 minutes from the market at Ogheye. He said the market has about 90 lockup shops and 86 open stalls, and would get its electricity supply from a servicing generating set. Besides, there are public toilets and a police post meant to check the activities of criminals, especially sea pirates. He said: “The market is being built on a massive platform at the edge of the Atlantic Ocean. It is tied in such a way that no matter the waves it will remain stable. “The market had been there over the years and it was built on planks. So, every six months they have had to change the planks. “So, we want to put a permanent structure in that place. The market will not be used only by Deltans but by people from Ondo State as well. So, the project is going to be of great economic value not only to the people selling in that area but also to communities in the neighboring state. “Fishing is the major occupation of the people in that locality; so we are building units for preserving fish and units for drying fish. If you visit the place today, you will see fish wasting; but that will be a thing of the past when the project execution is completed at the end of March 2021.’’ To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
