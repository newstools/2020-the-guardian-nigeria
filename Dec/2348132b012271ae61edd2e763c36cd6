He was always there for the interest of his people. Some of us who were fortunate to work with him found him possessing rare leadership qualities. “It is not only Gombe State that lost a rare gem, it is the entire country crying for a replacement,” the Senate president said. He sought prayers for the country saying: “As leaders, we need prayers of the people to be able to steer the ship of the country because the current situation the nation found itself is pathetic. Only prayers can redeem us. The issues of insecurity and COVID-19 pandemic are major concerns to all patriots.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
