Nigeria’s leading promoter of motorsports, Work, and Play, has revealed its support for Fanfaro Autofest billed for Ibadan on December 13, 2020. Explaining its decision to support the auto fair, Work and Play founder, Ade Ojuoko, said Fanfaro offers his firm an opportunity to extend the benefits of the active motorsports community in South-Western Nigeria. “Fanfaro is a brilliant expression of what motorsports represent — youthfulness, fun, entrepreneurship, and community engagement. And our team at Work and Play believes it complements our vision of engaging more youth and exposing them to the benefits of the sports. “We have already established partnership with the BMW Club and Zuru Motorsports. These two events are on cards for this month as well. Fanfaro will be the biggest assemblage of top race cars in this part of the country so far this year and we’ll see the need to associate with them.” The event, which is in its second year, will be held at cultural centre in Mokola-Ibadan. The promoter of the Fanfaro Autosports, Adekunle Olanrewaju, said the partnership would help convey a spike in deliverables at the one-day event; as compared to last year. “Apart from the line-up of top racers that we have been able to attract, this year’s event will also feature top celebrities, including Deejay Jimmy Jatt and Nollywood star, Wale Ojo,” he added. Other supporters of the event include Toyota Nigeria, SMT, MEGAMOUND, Soundcity, YM Autos, and Gabaz, among others. The event will feature drifting, auto shows, and races, and winners will be rewarded with cash prizes. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
