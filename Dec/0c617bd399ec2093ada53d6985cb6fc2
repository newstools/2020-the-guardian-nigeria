He said the judiciary clinic was pertinent to human development and noted that the project was executed despite the interception of the fiendish COVID-19. “Given the sedentary nature of work of judges, magistrates and lawyers, it is absolutely necessary to have a health facility within the precincts of the judiciary. “Most judiciary officers find it not only difficult but inappropriate queuing up with other patients in the public hospitals to access medical attentions. “Proximity to health facility of this nature will certainly make accessibility to medicare a lot easier and much more efficient,” Nwaigwe said.
