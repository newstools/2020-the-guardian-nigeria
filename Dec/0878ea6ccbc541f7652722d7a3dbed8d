 NNPC  Most of the issues listed against the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) in past reports of the Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI) have either been fully resolved or are being addressed.
  
The resolution of the grey areas was achieved by a joint committee of the two organisations. The committee – NEITI-NNPC Joint Committee on Remediation and Mainstreaming – was inaugurated on 21 November 2019 by the heads of the two institutions and was charged with reconciling 20 legacy issues, producing a status update and making recommendations for deepening transparency in the NNPC operation.
  
After reviewing documents and deliberating for about a year, the committee recently presented its report to the senior management teams of the two organisations, which reviewed the report and approved as follows: 11 issues (or 55 per cent) are deemed fully resolved; eight issues (or 40 per cent) are deemed partially resolved or ongoing while the remaining is yet to be resolved.
