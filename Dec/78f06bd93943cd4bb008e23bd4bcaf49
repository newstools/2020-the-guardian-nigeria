Despite the executive orders signed by President Muhammadu Buhari and Governor Hope Uzodimma of Imo on COVID-19 safety protocols, compliance in the Eastern Heartland is still poor. The Guardian observed that churches services, as well as social and cultural activities still attracted large crowds. The General Overseer of Charismatic Renewal Ministries, Dr. Cosmas Ilechukwu, had appealed to the federal and state governments to allow the churches function unhindered, arguing that there was no report of people contracting the virus through congregation. Uzodimma had ordered arrest of those gathering more than 100 for events, to no avail. Most Imo residents, The Guardian gathered, believe that the pandemic is exaggerated. President-General of Okwu Uratta community in Owerri North Council, Val Okara, told The Guardian yesterday: “Weddings and church activities are going on without social distancing. People are not aware that the pandemic exist in the rural areas. Yesterday, I attended a function hosting more than1,000 people. Only two persons wore face masks. People feel it is one of the antics of the government.” According to the PG, there is no reported case of the virus or people infected as a result of church gatherings. “Government should focus on governance and allow churches stay. Churches are praying so that it will not spread here.” The only report we hear is people who travel abroad and bring the virus here. I think government should allow churches activities here,” he added.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
