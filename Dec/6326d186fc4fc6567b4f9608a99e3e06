YBNL Princess, Temmie Ovwasa, Calls Out Olamide And YBNL Temmie Ovwasa, popularly known as YBNL Princess has taken to Twitter to call out YBNL and Olamide for snatching away her hope of becoming a big artiste. On Monday, she tweeted: Omo, it’s YBNL thinking that I’m going to keep quiet after they fucked be over for nearly 5 years,
My voice may not be loud but I fit shout.
You don’t give a person hope & snatch it from them.
Olamide Adedeji, I will always have your name in my mouth.
Silence is not my language. — E be like say dem swear for me. They/Them/Theydy (@THETemmieOvwasa) December 7, 2020  Temmie claims that in 5 years, she has just 4 singles and 4 videos. Tweeting further, she claims her growth with the label is limited because of their “misogynistic and homophobic” nature. Writing further about her ordeals, she says all her shows were cancelled by Olamide with no reasons and she never complained, rather, she was grateful. How the fuck do you keep a child you brought to Lagos all the way from ilorin in a house for almost 5 years without allowing her drop anything for 3 years, You rejected all my shows for no fucking reason. And I was nothing but grateful because at least I dey YBNL. She further claims Olamide has sent his fans to bully her into silence: Depending on your fans to bully me into silence, My dia nobody can bully someone that doesn’t have shame 
And those ass kickers who will lick anything as long as it has money attached to it will troop in.
If anything happens to me y’all know who to call. https://t.co/B0sbM1dpCA — E be like say dem swear for me. They/Them/Theydy (@THETemmieOvwasa) December 7, 2020  This outburst by Temmie has generated different reactions from people. While some blame her for not addressing the issues with Olamide rather than bringing it to social media, others supported her using social media to rant. Making reference to artistes who had been signed to YBNL and are succesful as an example that the issues might be with Temmie, a twitter user, Jimoh Rapport said: Temmie Ovwasa can’t really put the blame on YBNL shaa…Cos Olamide is known for experimenting: bring you in, drop 1-3 songs, if it hits – you get a proper contract & he goes all out to make you a star (Kesh, AG, Fireboy). If not, you go back to the streets.D game is d game! He further listed other YBNL artistes that are not as successful as those mentioned above: When you gather young talents without proper contracts & management, situations where the talents become disgruntled is bound to happen. 4 songs, 4 videos in 5 years for Temmie Ovwasa, then you kick her out… See Davolee, Lyta, & others too. Another tweeter user says the YBNL princess is rather ungrateful, he tweeted: To even think Olamide took temmie ovwasa to London so she can perform at his show, this girl is ungrateful. Shey na she pay for visa ni???

I just want to know. — ℂ𝕒𝕝𝕝 𝕄𝕖 ℙ𝕙𝕚𝕝𝕥𝕖𝕣 (@CallMePhilter) December 7, 2020  When olamide was going through stuffs, nobody hear from baba until he con drop Triumphant…. I no know wetin she Dey go through wey she Dey say “E b like dem Dey do ham” Mke she better comport — Alex (@IjohbarEric08) December 7, 2020  You have just disappointed your fan base with this ungrateful statement of yours. This can be settled amicably without calling out Olamide & painting him with the cause of your lost hope. People are doing well in YBNL & you should find a way to make waves. #NotLikeThis https://t.co/rEuBbp3fO3 — A∂єηιуι Vιƈƚσɾ Aναѕ ✪ (@I_Avas) December 7, 2020  I don’t know how exposed her parents are but I would have advised her to leave that nest. Just seeing her old image in comparison to her new image hurts me. YBNL wasn’t the best choice for her at that age especially being an only female in that nest. Olamide too was young then. — Shokolate (@shokolatepuddin) December 7, 2020  Olamide is yet to react to these allegations.
