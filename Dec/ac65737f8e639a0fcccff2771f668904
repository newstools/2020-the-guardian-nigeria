 Justice Walter Onnoghen  Taking a swipe at the former CJN for claiming he was not told his offence before his ignominious removal, Obiechina stated: “If he was not told his offence, what did he go to the Code of Conduct Tribunal (CCT) to defend? What was he defending then at the High Courts and later, Court of Appeal? 
 
“What were his team of lawyers defending in those courts or were they busybodies? This is a case of refusing to tell oneself the basic truth. If you do not know why you were removed, go to Google and see that the world knows. You are equally saying that the rulings and judgments delivered by different courts on this matter were not based on legal facts before the courts, but merely delivered at the figments and inventions of those judges, since there was no case against you before them. “By implication, as a former High Court Judge, Appeal Court judge, Justice of the Supreme Court and CJN, you are telling Nigerians and the entire world to lose faith in Nigerian judiciary, as judgments obtained in Nigerian courts, from your experience, are not based on law, but on extraneous factors. 
 
“Was that what you were doing? If you were not doing so, why kill the system that raised you up and fed you, simply because you mis-endeavoured and crashed?” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
