The Corporate Alliance on Malaria in Africa (CAMA) has launched its strategic plan for 2021-2023, which sets out the blueprint for action for the next three years. Through private sector initiatives, the Alliance aims at reaching millions of people with malaria control interventions to improve awareness and scale up prevention activities. The group said the COVID-19 pandemic has placed an extra burden on health systems worldwide, as many countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, are now facing a double challenge of protecting their citizens against existing threats to public health, like malaria, and emerging ones, like COVID-19. Team Lead, Global Public Health & Special Projects, Chevron Corporation, and Co-Chair, CAMA, Michael Steinberg, said: “CAMA’s work has contributed to improved systems, partnerships and learning that benefit local capacities well beyond malaria…” Head, Sustainability, Access Bank, and Co-Chair, CAMA, Omobolanle Victor-Laniyan, said: “There’s still so much we can do together to advance our objective as a responsible coalition, and as responsible businesses in the face of global health challenges.” He said the End Malaria Project would be a major initiative under the new strategic plan, which would galvanise private sector resources and capabilities towards reducing the incidence and prevalence of malaria in the most endemic communities in Nigeria by 2023, a step towards complementing the government’s efforts in achieving a malaria-free Nigeria. Coordinator, Nigeria National Malaria Elimination Programme (NMEP), Dr. Audu Bala Mohammed, said: “We have seen how the private sector has made a big difference when the COVID-19 pandemic began… We’re sure that this partnership and collaboration will go a long way for Nigeria to address the issue of malaria.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
