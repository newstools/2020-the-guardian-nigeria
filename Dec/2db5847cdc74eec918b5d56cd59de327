National Conscience Party (NCP) has urged the National Assembly to enact a law against political cross-carpeting. The National Chairman, Dr. Yunusa Tanko, stated in Abuja yesterday that the lawmakers must work on the Electoral Bill at their first sitting in 2021 as a New Year gift to Nigerians. Tanko said: “We call for penalties for political nomadism to stop political prostitution of moving from one political party to another during elections.
  
“Having missed the much anticipated December 2020 target, the need to have the electoral bill passed and signed in January 2021 has become imperative and most instructive, so that it could be tested and used in good time for the 2021 Anambra governorship election.” According to him, the impressive turn-out of Nigerians at the public hearing, the quality presentations and suggestions, as well as the adoption of memoranda, are a sure testament to the eagerness of the people to have credible elections through the quick passage of the bill. The chairman added: “As we anticipate the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to announce the date and time-table for the Anambra election any moment from now, we must take cognisance of lawful need to have the New Electoral Act 2021 (Independent National Electoral Commission Act 2021) in place, before the commencement of the implementation of the time-table.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
