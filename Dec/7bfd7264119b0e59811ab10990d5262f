The group, in its congratulatory message, also lauded his achievements as governor of the State.

The group also beckoned on all Nigerians to keep backing the governor with prayers of long life and protection. According to the spokesman for the group, Micheal Ogunsina, the governor deserves all the prayers on his birthday, adding that, having his birth date fall on Christmas day is a sign that just like Jesus Christ, Makinde was also chosen and sent by God to lead Oyo State.

We pray to God to continue to guide him right, and make him triumph over all his detractors,” the group said. The group, also stated further that, they are confident that the governor is a man of his word and will deliver on all his mandates to the Good people of Oyo State. The group called on the people of Oyo state to continue supporting the governor in any and every capacity they can, advising them not to fall for the gimmicks of the oppositions in the State and elsewhere, hell bent to soiling his reputation with the play of dirty politics. “As everyone knows, Makinde has constructed a lot of new roads, reconstructed of old ones, attended to social services, distribution of palliatives to the poor and vulnerable, quality Healthcare, economy expansion, prudent management of state funds, increased reputational rating, creation of thousands of jobs, attraction of more Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), mass relocation of people and businesses to Oyo State due to the business friendly atmosphere and the inviting policies of Governor Seyi Makinde, increase participation in agro businesses, clean and light up Oyo State, continued investments in the provision of security gadgets and equipment, for both conventional police and Amotekun Corps, and lots more,” the group said.
