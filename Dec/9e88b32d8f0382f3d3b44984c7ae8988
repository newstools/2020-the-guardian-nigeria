Ikpeazu made the announcement in a statement issued by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Onyebuchi Ememanka, and made available to newsmen in Aba on Saturday The governor noted that the activities of touts had increased in parts of the state due to the culture of revenue collection along major roads.

Ikpeazu further directed the Chairman of Osisioma Ngwa Local Government Area, Mr Christian Kamalu, to immediately rid the Osisioma Flyover of touts to restore decency. “Henceforth, is has become illegal for any revenue agent to waylay or harass motorists or other road users along major roads in the state. “The police and other law enforcement agencies have been told to enforce this directive, anybody found culpable will face the law,” he said.
