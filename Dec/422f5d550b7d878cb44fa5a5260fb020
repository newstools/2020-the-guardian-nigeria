There are concerns that the surge in cases of pirate attacks and kidnapping of crews on the Gulf of Guinea and Nigerian waters may further threaten the prospect of the maritime sector.
   
The toll on seafarers has continued to rise with reports that another eight crew members were kidnapped in the Gulf of Guinea on Wednesday. The threat to seafarers remains high in the region as the security services warn that additional incidents are likely to occur in the coming days.
  
The latest incident, according to Dryad Global, involved a 38-year old bulk carrier, the Stevia. The 11,990 DWT vessel registered in Cameroon was reportedly sailing from southern Nigeria to Abidjan, Ivory Coast when it was attacked by pirates believed to be local militants.
Praesidium reports that the vessel’s speed dropped and was believed to drift for about two hours.  The 127-meter long Sea Ranger was boarded some 160 nautical miles south-west of Brass, Nigeria, with Dryad Global reporting the incident is “concluded” and both vessel and crew safe.
   
The boarding is the second this week in the Gulf of Guinea and the third time Sea Ranger was boarded this month (December). Dryad Global report stated: “There has been a surge of incidents in the past five weeks, resulting in an increased risk rating for the Gulf of Guinea to critical on 11 November.
   
“As failed attacks continue, perpetrators are likely to increase in desperation. This is because of increased risk to themselves from naval counter-piracy activity and logistical strain. Vessels are most vulnerable when skiffs approach under cover of darkness, approaching and boarding with little or no resistance,”
   
Praesidium International, meanwhile, reported that on 10 December, the Cameroon-flagged product tanker CAP Saint Georges was boarded by an unknown number of perpetrators. Reports showed that five crew members were abducted (3 Cameroonians, 1 Ghanaian and 1 Sierra Leonian).  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
