After a series of complaints about delay in issuing of visa to the team by the South Africa High Commission in Nigeria ahead of Wednesday’s CAF Confederation Cup first leg encounter against Bloemfontein Celtics FC, the Rivers United FC departed Port Harcourt yesterday for South Africa to begin preparations for the tie. Speaking to The Guardian yesterday, the Media Officer of the team, Charles Mayuku, stated that after interventions from several quarters, the players were issued their visas to travel to South Africa yesterday evening. He noted that the players are poised to excel in the first leg encounter despite the hitches encountered in processing their visas. “The team is ready for the game in South Africa. Once we arrive in South Africa, the players will settle down and begin preparations immediately for the game scheduled for Wednesday. All hands are on deck for success in the first leg encounter. Rivers United is not under any pressure,” he said. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
