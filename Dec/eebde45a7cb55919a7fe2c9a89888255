He was so willing to listen as typical of the President, the usual democrat that he is. “What we basically sought was to convey the resolution of the House and to fix a date which we did not fix, out of respect for Mr President and his very tight schedule, what date will be convenient. “We have agreed on a date and he will meet with the House to address the situation. We have fixed a date but we will communicate with you. “He is a perfect democrat; he will come to the House to address members in the nearest future.
