Mariah Carey, Ariana Grande and Jennifer Hudson | AP It’s a trio of queens as singers Mariah Carey, Ariana Grande and Jennifer Hudson just delivered some Christmas cheer with the new single “Oh Santa.” The divas all put their best “sleigh” foot forward with the new song that was released today. Mariah decided to top her “All I Want For Christmas Is You” classic but this time, she enlisted the help of the other two A-listers. “Oh Santa” was released along with Carey’s Magical Christmas Special on Apple TV+. Seeing the three of these women come together for a Christmas song makes a lot of sense. Mariah is the uncrowned queen of the season, while Ariana has recorded a pair of holiday EPS – 2013’s Christmas Kisses and 2015’s Christmas & Chill. Jennifer performed “How Great Thou Art” along with Pentatonix, sang “O Holy Night” with Kelly Clarkson on The Voice, had her own Jennifer Hudson: I’ll Be Home For Christmas special in 2009, and appeared in the 2013 Christmas movie, Black Nativity. So, Mariah couldn’t have picked two better women to join her for this song. Watch below:
