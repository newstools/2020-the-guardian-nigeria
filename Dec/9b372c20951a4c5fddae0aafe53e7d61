A former Minister of Education, Obiageli Ezekwesili, has called for an assessment of the physical and mental capability of President Muhammadu Buhari to carry on with the duties of his office. Ezekwesili asked that a medical panel be set up to assess the president, noting that the condition of the country has become too grave for citizens to sit still. The former minister, who made the call yesterday on her verified Twitter page, said that the State House physician could not be trusted to provide accurate information, hence the need for an independent panel. “I think that at this stage and depth of fragility of the Nigeria-State, privacy has to yield ground to our right to know as citizens, the state of health of Buhari. “We really must assess the physical or mental capability of Nigeria’ President to carry on with the duties of office. “Citizens can collectively push for an independent panel to help us make the critical medical determination of the state of mind and body of our President Buhari. “The conditions of Nigeria have become too grave for us all to sit still and watch a train wreck in the making. “As an extremely concerned citizen, I hereby demand for a medical panel on Buhari since we obviously cannot trust the State House Physician to provide us accurate information. “ The former presidential aspirant emphasised that a mental and physical assessment is important as Nigerians need full disclosure before the situation in the country worsens. “It is reasonable demand now for citizens to have full disclosure on the state of health of Buhari,” she said.
