Bauchi State residents have expressed dissatisfaction over the habitual rejection and referral of patients to privately owned hospitals by the Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University Teaching Hospital (ATBUTH). One of the patients, Abubakar Idris, who took his daughter to the Paediatric Unit for treatment, said he was referred to the hospital from a private one, only to be referred back to a private hospital. “I don’t know what is really happening,” he said. A mother, Farida Shehu also said the doctors told her that they could not attend to her because of insufficient bed space. She said: “The doctor did not bother to ask me what the problem was. He simply told me ‘please madam, go to ReeMee Private Hospital. We only attend to emergency here. As you can see, there is no more bed space.” Another resident, Habiba Sai’du, who rushed her two daughters to the Paediatric Unit, lamented the mortality rate being caused by inadequate personnel and equipment. “We have spent more than two weeks here, and I have seen days where about eight kids gave up in the emergency room. This is not really good. The government should help us.” The Acting Chief Medical Director, Dr. Sai’du Abubakar Kadas, had in August, complained of insufficient personnel to man the readily available equipment and structure. He said the government should look into the issue of embargo on employment, saying the hospital receives patients from neighbouring states. When contacted on the telephone on the new development, Dr. Kadas did not respond and has yet to reply to the text message sent to him.
