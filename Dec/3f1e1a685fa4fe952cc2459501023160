Zayn and Waliyha Malik “Pillowtalk” hitmaker Zayn Malik was noticeably absent at the wedding of his younger sister Waliyha. 22-year-old Waliyha tied the knot with 24-year -old ex convict Junaid Khan. Khan was jailed for five years in 2017 for stealing an elderly woman’s car in her home. The judge also reportedly gave him the long sentence because he showed no signs of remorse. Their father Yasser was also absent at the ceremony, instead Waliyha stepped out with her mum Trisha in front of friends and family. A report by The Sun claims that ‘nobody is happy’ about her marrying the ex-convict. ‘No one is happy about her marrying him after what he did. He’s a thug, this isn’t in his past — he’s only just got out of prison,’ a source told The Sun.

Throughout lockdown, the singer has been staying at his girlfriend Gigi Hadid’s family farm in Pennsylvania while raisng their new born daughter.
