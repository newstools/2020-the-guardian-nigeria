The international travel guidelines outlined very specific and clear protocols and guidelines for inbound and outbound flights and passengers, in line with infection prevention measures, including a provisional seven-day self-quarantine protocol for all returning travelers to Nigeria, which became effective on September 5. On November 3, Chairman of the PTF and Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Mr. Boss Mustapha, said the task force was highly concerned about the default rate of inbound travelers not presenting for the mandatory COVID-19 test on day seven in Nigeria. The SGF warned that the PTF was set to sanction travelers who refused to present themselves for the test, stressing the need to activate the sanctions, which include the suspension of passports of such defaulting individuals for six months minimum or outright visa cancellation for foreigners.
