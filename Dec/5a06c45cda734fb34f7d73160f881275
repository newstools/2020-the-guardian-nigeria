Shareholders of Omatek Ventures Plc have appealed to the Bank of Industry (BOI) to re-open the company, which has been shut since 2017.
  
The shareholders made the appeal at the company’s combined five-year annual general meeting (AGM) for 2015 to 2019, which was held in Lagos.
  
In December 2012, the firm secured a term loan and working capital facility totalling N5.81 billion from BOI for the purpose of financing the procurement of assembly components for the production of laptops. But things awry for the company and it could not service the loan, leading to a court order to take over premises of the tech company.
    
According to the shareholders, the closure of the company’s flagship factory in Oregun, Lagos, by the BOI has halted the company’s operations, making it impossible for it to record sales from which it could service its loans.  On efforts to reposition the company, Farinre said the board and management were looking at inviting fresh investors to inject working capital.
