 Chicken market  A survey carried out by The Guardian across major markets in Lagos – Ile-Epo, Agege, Daleko, Ojuwoye, all in Lagos State and Sango, Ifo, Arigbajo and Wasimi, Ogun State, showed that the price of the chickens increased by about 100 per cent compared to this time of last year.
 
It was learnt that a sizable broiler chicken, which sells for N5, 000 currently sells for as high as N15, 000 in Lagos, competing with the price of a live turkey and goats that sell around that region. Old layers, which sells between N1, 500 and N2, 000, currently sells for N4, 000. A cockerel sells for between N4, 500 and N6, 000.
