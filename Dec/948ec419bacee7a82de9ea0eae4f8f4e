Bebe Cool is yet to respond to the accusations. However, days before the event at which Omah Lay and Tems performed in Uganda, a facebook post by Bebe Cool questioned why the organisers of the event would invite Nigerian artistes when many Ugandan artistes are struggling financially as a result of the covid-19 restrictions imposed by the government: “I have reliable information that there will be a concert in Uganda this Saturday by some 2 Nigerian artsists in Uganda. I beg the organiser to immidiately cancel this act with due respect. Am a Ugandan artist and I will stand in for me and my fellow artists who have been stopped from performing in Uganda for all these months due to covid-19 and we respected the rules and regulations,” Cool wrote on his facebook page. Bebe Cool Facebook Cool continued: “What hurts me is many other sectors have at least been compensated but not Ugandan artists. Even if we haven’t been compensated or given any financial help by the government in form of support, at least let us not be looked down at like that. Many of my fellow Ugandan artists are financially struggling and their carriesrs are at stake and then this, NO. Get this money and pay Ugandan artist only for now if even covid-19 is not in consideration for this event. “Let me hope this is a dream am in coz if its real, I will make every effort to fail this event.” Omah Lay, Tems and her manager Muyiwa Awomiyi were subsequently arrested by officers of the Uganda police force in Kampala, Uganda for reportedly flouting covid-19 guidelines. They spent two days in police custody with a court hearing before they were released and returned to Nigeria on Thursday, December 17. Read More:
