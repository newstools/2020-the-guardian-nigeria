Ogundipe stressed that apart from the grants received from TETFUND, buildings that meet the international standards for learning, worth billions would be funded by TETFUND, while Pastor Daniel Olukoya would commission a project at the Senate building in 2021. He advised law students to remain committed to proving to the world that the faculty of law remains the best and a good brand, adding that the institution is committed to growing academic scholars that would be able to represent and defend the academic system.
   
Prof. Adele Jinodu who represented the donor at the commissioning stressed that beyond the building donated by Okunnu, the elder statesman always felt the commitment to invest in education.
    
The building, which is the fourth floor of the faculty of the law building, has a moot court, two seminar rooms, eight lecturer offices, a boardroom, lawyers changing room, a judges’ room, and rest room. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
