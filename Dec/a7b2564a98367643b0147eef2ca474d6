In a bid to boost learning and digital skills in Lagos State schools, Special Assistant to the Governor on Education, Mr. Tokunbo Philip Wahab, in company of the Tutor-General/Permanent Secretary Education District (TGPS), Education District 5, Mrs. Anike Adekanye, has commissioned libraries and ICT centres at Jibowu Junior High School and Onike Girls Junior High School, Yaba. Tokunbo stressed the need to intervene in areas of information technology where students are lagging behind, noting that the library is equipped with books, computers and a generating set.
 
“As we wrap up the transition to information technology revolution, we are introducing students to ICT in order to prepare them for the future,” he said. Tokunbo added that the gesture would be extended to about 60 schools in the state next year. He called on parents to encourage learning at home, stating that the role of teachers ends in school while parents must endeavour to keep an eye on how their wards use ICT and social media.
  
The principal of Jibowu Junior High School, Ms. Adesola Sofuye, said the library had been in bad condition and not in use by the over 1,000 students.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
