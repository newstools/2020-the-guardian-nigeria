In a show of humanitarian support, FCM Travels has reached out to children and employees of the Lions Village Motherless Babies Home, Lekki, Lagos, with food donations.
 
The gesture was aimed at bringing relief and smiles to the vulnerable group that could have been forgotten during the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the economy.
 
Head of Business, FCM Travel Solutions, Nigeria, Adejoju Sikuade, said the donation was in commemoration of this year’s World Food Day and to as well celebrate World Children’s Day.  Our donation is also a contribution to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals two, which is to achieve zero hunger by 2030.”
 
Social Worker at the orphanage, Funmilayo Adebayo, thanked the visiting team on behalf of the management, staff and children. She called on kind Lagosians and donors to remember the orphanage in cash and kind.
