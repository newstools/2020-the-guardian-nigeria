• Inducts 558 members The Chartered Institute of Taxation of Nigeria (CITN) has urged public office holders on the need for prudent management of taxpayers’ money to build trust among citizens. They recommended that reprioritising public spending to protect critical development expenditures and stimulate economic activities for the government to position itself for recovery from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was pertinent. President and Chairman of Council, CITN, Gladys Simplice, said this during the institute’s 43rd induction ceremony in Lagos, where about 558 members were admitted into the body. She said that the government needed to prioritise expenditure to intervene in critical sectors that would accelerate national economic growth and performance. She urged the newly-inducted members to exhibit professional expertise in their dealings, adding that their contributions were critical to the realisation of the goals of the institute by their active participation in the institute’s programmes and activities. The special guest of honour, Prof. Abdulmumini Bala Ahmed of the Department of Private and Commercial Law Faculty of Law, Bayero University, Kano, in his keynote address, said effective administration of taxation would tackle the country’s security challenges and bring succour to the already tensed economy. While urging the new members to uphold honesty and integrity as their watchword, he said they should never allow bias and conflict of interest to override their focus. With the challenges posed with the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the digital era, the Don urged them to remodel and up their ante in line with Adam Smith’s taxation principles for a digitalised economy.
