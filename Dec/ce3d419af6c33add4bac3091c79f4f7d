Southeast Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has said the Court of Appeal Abuja judgment of December 16, 2020, which quashed its former National Publicity Secretary, Olisa Metuh’s conviction renewed hope for the PDP and all Nigerians, who believe in constitutional democracy. National Vice Chairman of the party in the Southeast, Chief Ali Odefa, in a statement, yesterday, stated that a careful examination of the High Court processes and judgment that sentenced Metuh to a seven-year jail term was a predetermined decision from Justice Okon Abang’s innermost recess to please some undemocratic forces. “In building a progressive democratic society, patriots pay heavy prices with some even paying the supreme price. Metuh’s 10-month sojourn at the Federal Correctional Centre, Kuje, Abuja, was part of the price our party has to pay for building a viable democratic culture where the rule of law takes precedence over individual and personal interests and fantasies. “As the party that piloted the affairs of the Nigeria’s transition from military rule to democratic governance, the PDP is not new to the oppressive tactics and anti-democratic forces including using some judicial officers to carry out their predetermined ends in the cloak of serving justice. “We are, however, consoled and at the same time given hope by the patriotic conduct and decision of the Court of Appeal, which has restored hope in our judicial system,” Odefa said in the statement. He said the Appeal Court’s decision had once demonstrated that Nigeria was bigger than individual or clique interests, adding that the PDP was committed to Nigeria’s democratisation process and the singular justice served in Metuh’s case had further strengthened the belief and resolve to make Nigeria work again for all. The PDP, therefore, enjoined Nigerians to keep faith with the party, adding: “We are determined to lead our people to the promised land, a nation where merit is promoted over mediocrity, a country guided by its own laws and where its citizen can aspire to greatness through a dint of hard work, patriotism and promotion of our collective interests.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
