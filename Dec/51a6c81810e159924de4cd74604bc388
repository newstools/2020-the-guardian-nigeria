Complaints about billings by distribution companies (DisCos) have continued to worsen unabated despite measures to address the issue.
   
The Nigeria Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) on several occasions indicated its displeasure with estimated charges passed on to electricity consumers and repealed its benchmarks for computing the consumption of unmetered consumers.
  
DisCos have continued to subject unmetered consumers to what they described as outrageous charges. For instance, some consumers serviced by Ikeja Electricity Distribution Company (IKEDC) have continued to lament that the service rendered is not commensurate with the charges they are compelled to pay every month.  “Without a proper energy audit, we find it strange and disturbing for any sincere service rendering company to assume consumption in a community to be over 600kw per resident.” “The billing for November is not acceptable and very contestable. We are, by this notice, insisting on discontinuing the use of your service in our community,” the resident wrote.  The Federal Government had in October commenced the distribution of six million free pre-paid electricity metres to Nigerians through the National Mass Metering Programme (NMMP), with the launch of the scheme in Eko, Kano, Kaduna and Ikeja Distribution Companies (DisCos) franchise areas. It would be recalled that President Muhammadu Buhari, had in August this year, ordered distribution companies to carry out mass metering of consumers nationwide.
