There was jubilation yesterday in Abraka, Ethiope East Local Government Area of Delta State, as a kidnapped six-year-old girl, identified as Courage, was found in Benin City, Edo State six days after.
 
A family source said Courage was kidnapped in Abraka town on December 21 and was taken to Adesuwa Police Station in Benin City by a lady who saw her roaming the streets.
 
“Courage was kidnapped on Sunday and later the kidnappers contacted us a day after. They spoke to us several times, claiming that they were at Eket in Calabar. Then, we reported the matter to the police initially, but we were careful not to involve them so that our daughter will not be hurt by her abductors, because they told us they were monitoring us.
