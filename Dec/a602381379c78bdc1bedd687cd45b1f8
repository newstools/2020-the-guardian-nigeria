The governor assured the DIG that his government would continue to give all the necessarily support to the police to enable them to protect the people of the two states. In his address, Folawiyo, who was the pioneer Assistant Inspector General of the zone, thanked the governor for donating the building. Folawiyo disclosed that Gov.
