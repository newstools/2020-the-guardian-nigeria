Chrissy Teigen Shares Inspiration Behind Quitting Intake Of Alcohol Chrissy Teigen has shared her inspiration for giving up alcohol, revealing she’s now embracing a sober lifestyle according to reports by HuffPost. The model and media personality has garnered a devoted social media following in recent years and told her Instagram followers on Wednesday that she is now four weeks sober. Posting a photo of writer Holly Whitaker’s book Quit Like A Woman on her Instagram story, Chrissy explained: One month ago, on my birthday, I got this book from my doctor and friend. I was done with making an ass of myself in front of people (I’m still embarrassed), tired of day drinking and feeling like shit by 6, not being able to sleep. I have been sober ever since and even if you can’t see yourself doing it or just plain don’t want to, it is still an incredible read. Quit Like A Woman has been described as a “groundbreaking look at drinking culture and a road map to cutting out alcohol in order to live our best lives without the crutch of intoxication”. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1300843 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/5fed94c92400007a328ada89-336x598.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="2276" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/5fed94c92400007a328ada89-336x598.jpeg 336w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/5fed94c92400007a328ada89-313x557.jpeg 313w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/5fed94c92400007a328ada89-627x1114.jpeg 627w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/5fed94c92400007a328ada89-135x240.jpeg 135w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/5fed94c92400007a328ada89-270x480.jpeg 270w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/5fed94c92400007a328ada89-338x600.jpeg 338w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/5fed94c92400007a328ada89.jpeg 630w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> In October, Chrissy and her husband, Grammy-winning musician John Legend, received a wave of support when they shared the news of the heartbreaking loss of their third child ― a son they’d named Jack ― after weeks of pregnancy complications.
