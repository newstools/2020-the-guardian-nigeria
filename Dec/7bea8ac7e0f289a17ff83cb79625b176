This bilateral project is needed to connect both worlds: Nigeria and Brazil. In a global village that we live right now, it’s important we bridge the gap and connect these two worlds together on relative points that connect us such as history, arts and culture. And as the senior curator of the organization, it is my primary duty to bring this to fulfilment. I have a few numbers of projects already on ground, projects I would like to fine-tune and develop more than their current state. One thing I can assure you is that it’s going to be a very busy year, next year and a lot would be done with the Nigeria-Brazilian community at home and abroad. Also, let me state it that I am starting work as soon as possible”. The Nigerian-Brazilian Public History Project is an initiative that seeks to recover the extensive contributions of Afro-Brazilians and their descendants to Nigerian society since their arrival in West African communities from the early nineteenth century to the early twentieth century. The project will curate, archive and disseminate various aspects of social, cultural, religious, economic and political life of Nigerians of Afro-Brazilian descent to the transformation of the Nigerian society in pre-colonial, colonial and post-colonial contexts. The project through its website is aimed towards providing useful materials that underscore the enormous role of Afro-Brazilians in West African public and private life, serve as important teaching tools from elementary to tertiary levels, provide resources for research and scholarship, and for useable knowledge for lay learners. The appointment of Adebowale is to help achieve these goals!
