•Tasks Christians on COVID-19 protocols at Xmas
National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu, yesterday, said with the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, year 2020 had been like a plane flying through turbulent skies, a 12-month calendar like none. “Yet, by the grace of God, we have persevered, and shall continue to move forward,” he stated. In a Christmas message, Tinubu said it was important to thank God for His mercies, noting:  “We do not and cannot forget those who we have lost. “More so than in most prior years, we are thankful for   Christmas Day for the spirit and teachings of Jesus Christ provide a precious gift unto us. If we use this gift wisely in our relationship with one another, we shall emerge from this turbulent storm a better and more just nation, a more compassionate people with a more hopeful future.” He continued: “In normal times, Christmas offers Nigerians of all faiths an opportunity to gather with families and friends to celebrate the birth of Jesus. Unfortunately, I must beseech you to forgo such large gatherings this year for the sake of our collective health. In its essence, Christmas is a celebration of life. And while ding so this year, we must protect ourselves and our loved ones from this terrible virus. “Yet, we also must take solace in the fact that nothing, not even this virus, can rob us of the spirit of Christmas and the hope and brotherly love it represents. Despite all that we have gone through, let kindness reign during this period.   “Let us place in our hearts and minds the commitment to be more tolerant and less judgmental of our fellow man.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
