Webb Fontaine is testament to this with several African led and staffed offices across the region. We are witnessing an age of tremendous advancement across the African continent whereby a wave of digital transformation, new ideas and ways of working are transforming the Trade and Customs landscape.  Webb Fontaine’s new R&D Centre will contribute to this by growing and nurturing fresh local talent, of which there is no shortage in the region, and supporting local governments to drive economic growth powered by the latest innovations and technology. Africa’s top talent will not only develop solutions to benefit the African continent, but will build AI applications to be used across the world, contributing to Webb Fontaine’s global mission.”  Since its foundation, Webb Fontaine has strived to evolve the Trade and Customs industry and support governments to improve, facilitate and streamline their processes.
