Pandemonium was let loose yesterday between Ude and Isinigbo communities in Akure North local government area of Ondo State over land dispute, leading to the death of two persons and burning of the palace of the traditional ruler of Ude, Sunday Boboye, in protest. 
 
The Guardian learnt that the Ajagun of Ude, Sunday Boboye, had laid claim to a portion of land to the chagrin of Isinigbo people. 
 
Reliable sources alleged that Boboye demolished houses belonging to Isinigbo people, including buildings belonging to non-indigenes. This sparked off the crisis as Isinigbo people bombarded Ude town and laid siege on the palace, destroying valuable properties and setting the palace ablaze.
