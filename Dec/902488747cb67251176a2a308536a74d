The quiet community of Odo-Ayandelu in Agbowa-Ikosi Local Council Development Area, Epe, has benefited from this year’s Health Initiative for Rural Dwellers, organised by the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), Lagos secretariat.
 
The State Coordinator, Mr Eddy Megwa, who led principal officers of the corps and medical personnel to carry out the outreach, was received at the palace of Oba Aderibigbe Asumo of Odo Ayandelu Kingdom.
 
Megwa commended the monarch, residents and Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, for the approval and construction of the NYSC permanent orientation camp in the community and for accepting to partner with the corps in the state.
