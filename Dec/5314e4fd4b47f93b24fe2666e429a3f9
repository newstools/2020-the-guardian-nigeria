One of the events that shaped 2020 in the solid mineral sector is the renewed call for the amendment of the Nigerian Minerals and Mining Act 2007, the Petroleum Act and related laws guiding natural resources management. This is as stakeholders alleged double standard by the federal government.
  
The demand for resource control was rife, as individuals and interest groups in the Niger Delta wanted an arrangement where the oil-producing states in the region would be allowed to exploit their resources and pay taxes to the central government.
  
They claimed such an arrangement was most equitable, as the Federal Government seems to have given tacit approval to some states in the north to manage their mineral deposits.  “All Nigerians are aware that the Federal Government is in the process of re-registering qualified companies allowed to mine mineral resources in the state on its behalf, just as obtains in the oil sector, which Silas mentioned.” The Minister of Mines and Steel Development, Olamilekan Adegbite, while speaking on what the ministry was doing to ensure true federalism in exploration of mineral resources said: “The first thing I ask a state government is do you benefit from the oil and gas proceeds? Oil and gas are also mining because you dig into the ground and look for resources to mine. One is solid while the other is liquid.
  
“We have all partaken in the lunch of our brothers in the Niger Delta. Now that our mother has cooked, we now say everybody should go to their tent. It is unfair; true federalism cannot happen that way.”
 
In a chat with The Guardian, Head, Department of History, Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife Dr. Tunji Ogunyemi, urged the oil-producing states to take a cue from Zamfara State and get a license from the Federal Government to exploit oil.
 
He added that it was lazy of oil-producing states to kick against the gold mining programme of Zamfara State, saying that they could also form a company to secure an oil exploitation license.
  
“There is nothing that stops the Rivers State Government from incorporating a company and then bidding for an oil well. What stops them? It is just laziness. Do you know that Osun State has a license to mine gold in Ilesha and has firmed out its license to different Chinese companies?  “If people in Zamfara have thought it good and expedient to get a mining licence for their good, why should you say they do not have the right to mine the gold in their domain.”
  
Also, a lecturer at School of Communication, Lagos State University, Dr. Tunde Akanni, stated that states are free to establish companies that could be used to operate in different sectors of the economy.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
