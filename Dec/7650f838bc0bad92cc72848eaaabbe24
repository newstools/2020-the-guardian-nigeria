• Fashola asks govs, commissioners to finish well with legacy projects
• Don’t impose your successor, Shettima counsels leaders Ekiti State Governor Kayode Fayemi has asked members of the State Executive Council nursing governorship ambition to resign rather than allowing the 2022 governorship struggle to truncate the vision of his government. This is just as the former Lagos State Governor and Minister of Works and Housing, Mr. Babatunde Raji Fashola (SAN) and former Borno State governor, Kashim Shettima, appealed to Nigerian leaders to build stewardships in the minds of the citizens for them to earn respect and enduring legacies after tenure. They spoke in Ado-Ekiti, yesterday, during the 2020 retreat organised by Fayemi, with the theme: “Finishing well and sustaining progressive leadership in Ekiti State.” Fayemi said the programme was conceptualised to appraise the gains and challenges made in the second year of his tenure, with a focus that there is room for improvement. Delivering his speech on “Finishing well, winning against all odds,” Fashola said that Fayemi and his team must focus on the kernel of the cardinal objectives of his administration to earn respect of Ekiti people. He gave the assurance that President Muhammadu Buhari would complete the federal secretariat awarded by the Federal Government and other road projects being undertaken in Ekiti State. HOWEVER, the senator representing Borno Central, Kashim Shettima,  appealed to Fayemi to resist the temptation of imposing a successor but to rather allow the system to produce a capable leader after him. He, therefore, urged leaders in Nigeria to always place high premium on competence and capability in appointing leaders against other primordial considerations.
