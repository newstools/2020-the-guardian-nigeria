The Nigerian Senate has expressed concern over the deficit in the country’s seafaring manpower capacity, just as experts noted that Nigeria can generate $12 billion yearly from the seafaring profession.
 
Speaking during the Maritime Academy of Nigeria (MAN) 2020 passing-out-parade/graduation ceremony of 235 Cadets at Iron, Akwa lbom State, Chairman OF Senate Committee on Maritime Transport, Senator Danjuma Goje, who was represented by Senator Akon Eyakenyi, highlighted the need for increased seafarers’ training to bridge manpower gap in the profession.
  
He said: “Maritime administration and learning is critical to the economy of Nigeria because as an import-dependent nation, over 90 percent of our trade, both import and export, is through the sea. Maritime trade is undertaken by professionals (seafarers) who must undergo prescribed courses of training in line with standards set by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO).
