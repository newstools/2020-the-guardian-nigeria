President Muhammadu Buhari has approved the appointment of an interim administrator to oversee the affairs of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC). He is Mr. Effiong Okon Akwa, the acting Executive Director, Finance and Administration of the Commission. He will assume headship of the agency till completion of the forensic audit. Akwa is a Fellow of the Institute of Chartered Accountants and a Solicitor of the Supreme Court of Nigeria. The development became necessary as a result of a plethora of litigations, and a restraining order issued recently against the Interim Management Committee of the NDDC by a Federal High Court in Abuja.
