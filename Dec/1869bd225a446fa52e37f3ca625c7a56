Gunmen in army uniform, yesterday, reportedly abducted three teachers at Ohorhe Secondary School in Uvwie Council Area of Delta State. The Guardian learnt that the gunmen stormed the school in a gold plated Toyota Highlander and held teachers and students hostage for hours before they seized their victims. An eyewitness said the gunmen drove into the school and headed to the staff room, where the teachers were relaxing and abducted three of them, others and students before escaping through alternative exits. One of the eyewitnesses said: “I was in the village for a visit and sitting with my brothers before we heard that kidnappers invaded the community school. So, we ran to the school, but before we got there, the abductors had already gone. “We met the teachers and they said some gunmen came to the school in army uniform and in a gold coloured Highlander and abducted three teachers.” When contacted, Spokesman of the Commissioner for Basic Secondary school, Sam Ijeh, said he learnt of the incident, but needed to confirm from the Chief Inspector of Education (CIE), who was authorised to report such incidents. The state Command’s Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Onome Onovughagbogaya, however, confirmed the abductions.
