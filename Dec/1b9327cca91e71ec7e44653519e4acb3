In Dongning, a 40-year-old maintenance worker at a port tested positive on Thursday, triggering the latest measures. Officials there said Saturday it would enter “wartime mode” — temporarily suspending public bus services and road transport, while requiring anyone leaving the city to produce a negative Covid-19 test from the preceding 24 hours. Schools will suspend classes and dine-in will be banned at restaurants, while in higher-risk areas only one member of each household will be allowed to leave the home once every two days to buy daily necessities — for no longer than two hours each time. In the Suifenhe case, a 39-year-old man who works as a loading and unloading worker at a trade zone tested positive. Both cities on Friday announced the launch of citywide testing, expected to be completed in three days. China — where the virus first surfaced late last year — has largely brought domestic transmission under control but recently reported local outbreaks in several cities. State media blamed the recent clusters on imports of frozen food and other shipments.

After a recent outbreak in Chengdu, officials said the virus was found on food stored in an elderly couple’s fridge. There is currently no evidence that people can catch Covid-19 from food or food packaging, according to the World Health Organization.
