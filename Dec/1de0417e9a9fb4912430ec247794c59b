• Envoy moves to shore up investments The Consul General of Nigeria to South Africa, Abdulmalik Ahmed, has said that the bilateral trade between Nigeria and South Africa is worth $8.6 billion.  Going further, he called on Nigerians to establish more businesses in South Africa to quell xenophobic attacks.
 
“I would call on Nigerian corporate entities to follow the lead of Air Peace and take advantage of the huge investment opportunities in South Africa. 
 
“The number of Nigerian corporate entities here compared to a large number of South African entities in Nigeria does not reflect the spirit of the industry of our people. An increase in corporate presence could be a weapon in the fight against xenophobia. We at the consulate are always ready to facilitate the processes of your arrival.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
