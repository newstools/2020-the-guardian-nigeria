Begins move for more affiliates across Africa
The African Students Football Union (AFSU) will establish its first centre of excellence for football development at the Lagos State University, the body has said. The body said the decision to start the move to develop football in African universities at LASU was because the Nigerian school won its maiden AFSU Cup. Rising from its inaugural executive board in Lagos, AFSU also announced plans to expand its programmes to cover all tertiary institutions (Mono and Polytechnics) and secondary schools across the continent. In a communiqué issued after the meeting, AFSU revealed that it has approved “regional friendship tournaments for the five Africa regions to hold in Ghana, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Morocco, and Gabon in 2021,” adding that it has also “approved the tertiary institutions football management and mentorship colloquium for Monrovia in Liberia for third quarter of 2021.” Other decisions reached at the meeting, according to the communiqué signed by its Executive Secretary, Olufemi Abioye, include the approval of a proposal on tertiary institutions development through the prism of football to hold in Kenya in 2021, as well as mandating the ASFU secretariat to “consummate more multilateral affiliation with registered institutions that can support its mandate which is geared at using the beautiful game of Football- the sports opium of the people to promote the “Town and Gown” relationship for the benefits of Student Footballers across the Africa.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
