Gunmen, late Monday, reportedly abducted 17 persons, including the community leader, Kabir Mohammed (popularly known as Magajin Gari) and two of his wives, at Kaigar Malamai village in Danmusa council area of Katsina State. Sources in the area said the attackers operated till the early hours of Tuesday before taking the captives into the forest. Though there is a heavy presence of security operatives in the local council, it remained unclear if they had gone after the assailants to rescue the victims. Danmusa, which remains one of the most insecure councils in the state, has seen dozens abducted, killed, maimed, and raped in the last couple of years. Secretary to the State Government (SGS) and an indigene, Mustapha Inuwa, are overseeing the government’s efforts to check banditry and related crimes in the area. The latest abduction comes days after bandits kidnapped 80 Islamic school students in Dandume Local Government Area of the state. But a combined team of security agents, comprising the military, police, and vigilance groups, rescued the pupils along with four other women and several rustled cows. Also on December 11, gunmen attacked Government Science Secondary School (GSSS), Kankara, where they seized 333 students. Negotiations between the bandits and government eventually led to their release six days later. Efforts to get the police’s reaction were futile as the force’s spokesperson in the state, SP Gambo Isah, did not respond to the inquiry at the time of going to press.
