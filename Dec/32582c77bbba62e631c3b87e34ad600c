Andy Sullivan put together a wonderful bogey-free round to open the Dubai Championship, and in doing so, set the course record, reports progofnow.com. The Englishman had it all going for him during the opening round of the Dubai Championship. You know it’s a good day when you have more birdies than pars, and no bogeys to boot. That’s exactly what happened for Andy Sullivan en route to his 61. Normally, when you see players shoot in the low 60’s, it is done on a par 70 course. This wasn’t the case for Andy Sullivan. It wasn’t just that he had more birdies than pars, it’s that he did it on a par 72, and finished with an astounding 11 birdies. He spread them out quite nicely as well, managing to split them as evenly as possible. Starting on the backside of the course, he would head back to the first tee with six already under his belt. -6 is a great place for a pro to be at the end of a round, and Sullivan was there after just nine holes. He would keep it going as well, as he would birdie five of the next seven holes. That meant, for just a brief moment in time, he had the magical and wonderous number of 59 in his sights. If he would be able to get two more birdies, running his total to an insane 13 on the day, then he would achieve the mark that is hallowed in the golf world and has only been bested by the 58 that Jim Furyk shot back in 2016. Unfortunately, he was unable to find any more birdies and would finish with “just” 11 of them. It wasn’t just Andy Sullivan that scoring came easy to. It was still enough to get him to 61, two shots ahead of Antoine Rozner, Matt Wallace, and Ross Fisher who all shot 63. There are two more men at -8 on the day, as Marc Warren and Oscar Lengden are tied for fifth place. The second round will get underway quite early Thursday for those of us in the states, and will likely finish up before anyone even gets to lunch.
