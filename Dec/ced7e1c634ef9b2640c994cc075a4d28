The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has urged the Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON) to facilitate speedy approval and publication of standards relevant to the commodity trading ecosystem.
  
The Director-General of the SEC, Lamido Yuguda, stated this, during a meeting with the management of the organisation in Abuja yesterday.
 
According to him, the commission constituted a technical committee on commodity trading as part of its implementation of the 10-year master plan, with a mandate to identify challenges facing the framework and develop a roadmap for a vibrant ecosystem.
 
He said: “A committee of various stakeholders including the SON was set up to drive the implementation of the report. One of the recommendations in the report identified the development of a grading and standardisation system in line with international best practices.
