Former Governor of Imo State, Rochas Okorocha, has explained that the Eastern Palm University in Ogboko, Ideato South Council of the state was established under a Private Public Partnership (PPP) arrangement. He said the Rochas Foundation for Africa has 90 per cent ownership, while the Imo State Government has 10 per cent. Okorocha, who is the President of Rochas Foundation for Africa and representative of Imo West Senatorial District, made the clarification as the ownership crisis of the university had continued unabated. Speaking yesterday at the third matriculation ceremony of the institution, he hinted that the university was not established for profit making, but primarily to impart knowledge to the less-privileged children across Africa. He said the ownership arrangement of the institution was not in doubt, adding that he would continue to strive towards ensuring that African children do not miss education due to the circumstances of their birth. Okorocha maintained that the university would remain the “centre for excellence in Africa, adding that former President of Liberia, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf was Chairman of the university’s council. He advised that the Imo State Government was free to sell its 10 per cent ownership to the foundation to enable it own it fully and tackle the challenges in the institution, noting that it was the first university under a PPP arrangement in the country.
