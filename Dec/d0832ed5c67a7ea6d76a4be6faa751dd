The Chairman, Board of Trustees, Ekiti Enterprise Challenge and President, Ekiti Parapo Lagos, Dare Ojo, said: “The goal of the challenge is to identify, groom, mentor and fund next generation of Ekiti young entrepreneurs with sustainable businesses that are based in the state, which have the potential to scale and grow beyond Ekiti local market and be patronised anywhere in the world.”
